2	44044	He was not a wealthy man .	He did like to live in upscale apartments , and his present abode fit him .	but
0	22648	I grabbed my coat .	Climbed out of the car .	and
0	106147	Inside the tent , however , the sultan and i , had no problem discussing the finer details of romance .	It seems as if we were hitting things off to a wonderful start when he asked me to partake in something that is a not so rare pirate delicacy .	and
2	83470	The girls left , even after the door swung shut behind them .	Channie could still hear their laughter echoing through the halls .	but
4	149540	She said to him without hesitation , while her mother was present sir hugo , i wish to see mr. deronda again as soon as possible .	She was in park lane and knew that the baronet was about to go down to the abbey .	when
0	123571	Yep , it 's him , '' a new , low voice drawled .	Jenks 's wings clattered .	and
2	158715	When i reached the fourth floor , my eyes scanned the cars .	I didnt recognize any of them .	but
2	46661	I scream to sarias men to help .	Now i can see they are struggling against some invisible hold and can not move .	but
3	145477	`` then why do i always have to take your dishes to the sink ? '' .	I 'm so awesome .	if
0	33652	They made it out .	They are the only one i have seen besides you two .	and
0	44212	The old man still looked very gray .	His breath was rasping .	and
3	17187	I know a place where no one will ever think to dig .	You hurt my daughter .	if
4	18356	`` , i need my magic .	We do find her .	when
4	24285	I could see his face .	I rose on my elbow .	when
2	96466	I 'd hoped that one day jason and i would figure out the key to reversing vampirism and that maybe i 'd know what it was like to hear david 's heart beat under my ear .	The truth of that wish occurred to me only then : even if those power were still possible , david would be long dead before i figured them out .	but
4	3403	Her heart had stopped .	She 'd realized that lord hope was about to run into the open to go to henry the footman .	when
4	16774	I feared id lost my charm .	She didnt respond to me .	when
3	127698	A lie , would be the absolute truth .	Her brother really had hired him to protect her .	if
4	56677	She had to agree .	She looked at them .	when
0	125732	We heard you yel ing . '' .	We 've been fighting all morning .	and
4	38591	I notice sometimes shes .	People talk to her .	when
0	139139	Chu rolled his eyes .	Chuckled , a sound that was thankfully whipped away by a surge of wind .	and
0	14062	Except alexia , who did not comprehend the gravity of the insult .	Was occupied trying to pick the last of the meringue off her husband 's dinner jacket .	and
0	137869	She pushed her bead into the tip of the stick , feeding energy into it .	Stretched it into a broad line .	and
2	116861	`` i 'm taller , and . '' .	I can beat your ass .	but
1	79403	Which just sent a shiver through her .	She remembered how much she 'd always liked his laugh .	because
2	55503	Before i could pick my jaw up off the floor and roll my tongue back into my mouth , the waitress appeared out of nowhere and , jarring me from the illusion that noah and i had just shared a private moment .	Set a glass of soda in front of each of us .	but
4	156888	He met the guys eye as he passed .	They called jjs order .	when
0	96911	Della spouted the moment they stepped through the clearing .	Got their first glimpse of the falls .	and
0	98891	The two men bowed .	Backed out of the room .	and
2	144389	My hunger had no specific desire for her .	Those small pinpricks of pain roused it that night .	but
3	38564	Regent jenner stay here have your war horn at the ready , i want you to blow it before you even think about using the bow said juruz .	The enemy attacks the gate .	if
2	114639	I do , will responded .	Didnt advertise his badge .	but
2	159129	This is my senior year and about getting into the right college and doing well on those sats .	Not only am i going to need to worry about graduating .	but
3	104152	He 'll definitely have suspicions .	I drag her away from her mother .	if
4	133748	Two other people were sitting where angie had been .	They came to the bar .	when
4	139186	The only thing inside the elevator was a small two-way radio .	It arrived at the ground level and the doors slid open .	when
0	155648	He signaled the other two .	They hurled pugsy 's last bodyguard off for serious core time .	and
3	51514	Why did it feel like so much more .	This was just sex .	if
0	11826	This map of the north atlantic is approximately to scale .	Shows cities and regions that play a role in this story .	and
2	121907	I kept trying to swallow the bad taste in my mouth .	The more i swallowed , the queasier my stomach grew .	but
2	55954	She 'd tried for a matter-of-fact tone .	Her eyes teared up .	but
0	159368	The fog had dampened the dirt surface of the road .	The sound of their horses ' hooves was muffled .	and
0	51042	The air was warm .	The harvest was almost finished .	and
1	62807	No , the reason there 's nothing to fear in the dark is .	Real monsters lurk in the light .	because
4	12476	Thankfully the cook ( doms wife ) clobbered the commissioner with a pan .	He tried to run out .	when
3	134359	He had begun to wonder .	This was ever going to happen .	if
2	140633	Only made the pressure on my chest worse .	The smell comforted me .	but
2	141590	When they 'd almost had a fevered pitch to them .	Then they deepened and my heart kicked up , thumping in my chest .	but
2	14323	I declined , mostly because i knew i 'd be the only one drinking .	I appreciated the effort .	but
2	149520	I wished his concern had been enough to drive the demon queen out of my head .	He could either accept me or he could n't . .	but
3	62496	Then you 'll know .	You 've read about me .	if
0	51318	Geoffrey simply removed his belt buckled it tightly around her quivering chin .	The redhead tried to dislodge the makeshift gag , but .	and
2	125079	She had hoped that they would go to college .	Neither of them had shown any interest , though haley was taking online classes .	but
0	99954	My good-sister is not hard to look upon , you will have noticed .	A stout castle and broad lands add to her charms .	and
2	145197	It surprised him to feel protective of someone he just met .	He couldnt help himself .	but
3	101048	The other biker must be raj .	I am correct in my speculation .	if
2	17667	The waters were calm .	There was a favourable gust in the winds .	but
4	137965	To cower behind some bushes .	I saw headlights closing in on me .	when
3	11078	I needed to be near someone who could help me fight .	She was going to try to take me over .	if
0	22510	She unclasped her cloak , laying it to the side ... pluck sighed and muttered , more than a season of this .	Released her tail from around her waist as she exclaimed .	and
2	133143	I think he 's alive .	I 'm not sure .	but
3	85829	He might gnaw on us .	Given half a chance .	if
0	900	Hysteria practically leaps up .	Grabs hold of me .	and
2	4782	Clara attempted to sound in control .	Tony heard the panic and anxiety in her words .	but
4	121167	It was hard to do .	All i wanted was to be in shane 's arms .	when
2	108121	As we knew before the jump , starship sirona chose to stay .	Starbase matrona is nowhere in sight , admiral .	but
4	76054	Only two years younger , shed been four .	Mother had been chosen .	when
0	86816	She 'd finished with my belt .	Moved on to my button and zipper .	and
3	133584	It sometimes set off a brawl .	The other guy was a jerk that made some suggestion about other rather impolite things that josey 's momma used to do .	if
4	106407	To see such weakness .	I knew of the sadistic delight it would bring him .	when
0	47784	I merely pointed at the mountain goat far on the other side of the rocky cut .	Let the talon go .	and
2	22409	Then , more seriously , he said , `` if you need more money for havenhurst , just tell me .	Your allowance is to be spent exclusively on yourself .	but
2	6188	The books were all gone now , and a musty , mildew scent had settled into the pores of the surrounding wood .	Rescued when their headquarters had been taken over by them .	but
2	52350	Clay watched to see if any of the crazies would try breaking into any of the houses .	Although they occasionally walked on the lawns , they showed no signs of graduating from trespass to burglary .	but
2	104171	The old man had not understood his only son .	He had stood by him .	but
2	127496	She wrote the place and address on a piece of paper on the notepad by the phone , and . '' .	If something i know about my puteri well , is that always put a lot of strength and pressure when she wrote , chances are we can see the marks on the next sheet .	but
0	142466	I 'm the traveling big shot .	Your boss wants to make sure i 'm happy .	and
2	64922	I didnt know what he was looking for .	I wanted to know the second he found it .	but
0	19367	Have kicked off her boots .	Reclined before a floor-to-ceiling window to take in the stunning nighttime view of the capital .	and
0	143820	Two have some shit to talk about .	That 's just great .	and
4	32638	He creeped me out .	I first met drew 's dad .	when
0	66054	So , promising himself that he 'd push the irritating little so-and-so into the next available cold water when he got the chance , the hunter had silently eased himself out of the canoe .	Then pulled the apprentice up onto the landing stage .	and
4	130050	It wouldnt be identified .	He lent it to the exhibition .	when
2	120148	Her information was interesting .	We still do not know what the power eater plans for the night of the hunter 's moon .	but
4	140188	How mad he would be at me .	He found out what i had done .	when
0	150986	She had just slid into it .	Was bending down to tie up her boots when the door to her room burst open .	and
4	130778	They might leap from their concealment and rescue her .	Our enemies produce queen ehlana to exchange her for bhelliom .	when
2	129140	After all , the episode with doc jane and john 's procedure had helped her phobia .	She had quite enough to deal with at the moment and the last thing she needed was to walk into another operation -- and god only knew what they were doing to that poor female who 'd been rolled in after her .	but
0	46736	Eric was a doctor .	Specialized in gene therapy .	and
4	75895	However she had already disappeared from view .	He looked back in katrinas direction to see if she had heard him .	when
3	109204	'' he replied with a lusty grin .	The owner was going to nail you .	if
0	102249	There are no tables .	The only thing turning is the earth they stand on .	and
4	22243	I glared at him as he looked down at my face .	Winkler hung up after a while .	when
0	8875	Corbin drew a flask of water from a hidden pocket , you know then what this will mean for you and your future relationship to your people .	Said to the eager creature .	and
0	104132	Then i pulled it out .	Backed up all the way .	and
2	76327	Speech and action failed me and .	I drifted away into a curious sea of unconsciousness .	but
2	34458	The destination address is a po box and , and nobody steals books out of the mail .	He sends it book rate .	but
3	32378	I would have worried less . '' .	He 'd stolen things , or come in while i was .	if
2	79109	Captain , i dont know what theyre up to .	I cant hear anything in .	but
2	156123	There were laboratories run by otters .	They were all far away in europe or on the space station .	but
3	47940	Us fly they can also help us swim .	These suits can help .	if
0	78681	It was only a whisper .	His eyes had kindled a bright new flame .	and
2	118721	There was a guard on the rear door of shatta .	Before he could even think of turning away trev and his bodyguards , pepe appeared .	but
2	40264	Ben slipped in the snow .	He was able to stay upright .	but
2	121814	After dodging a jab , hilda threw a right , which was fast , and lea blocked it .	Single punch blew away her guard .	but
3	85833	How much richer would the long years of her life have been , but chosen to live for something else , like friendship or love .	She 'd still sought a way to stop kramer .	if
4	53932	Jinny said he was ready to go .	They arrived at 8am .	when
4	68607	The horrifically scarred face of the boy nyk had been .	They 'd first met as children .	when
0	47735	By then dawn had brushed the bluffs and hills of vicksburg .	The eli reynolds had her steam up .	and
2	113911	Never lacking in funds , my guardians were confident that it would be defeated given proper payment , and the mass hallucination of coinage is meaningless to a parasite .	Money means nothing without brilliance .	but
4	25159	The endearment had just exited his mouth .	The door flung open and a scowling bouncer named bobby appeared .	when
2	66533	He had thought hank to be simple at .	It had gradually dawned on him that hank had a way of asking every question that came into his mind rather than filtering out the asinine ones .	but
2	125206	The cabin was filled with the savory scent of onions and wild garlic i had no appetite .	My vegetable stew was bubbling , and .	but
2	121797	She had been upset feel a little embarrassed .	Accepted the excuse making james .	but
3	136655	By god , he would do it .	He had to personally pat down every dignitary who entered the event .	if
0	77642	You 'd lost a lot of blood .	Then you were operated on .	and
3	47856	I had to test my theory .	Even to discount it .	if
0	41838	Compassion for others had been drilled out of him .	Yet she breached the sanctity of all that training .	and
0	78135	Bring a vampire to class to tell his or her story .	You got great attendance .	and
4	57798	Kate had talked to him for less than ten minutes .	She knew that there was no way this man could be persuaded to do anything he did not want to do .	when
4	75686	Been glad to have him .	He realized grieg 's potential .	when
4	117953	To fight for her life .	Kendal is told to meet gp at the wharf when the moon is at the highest point in the night sky .	when
3	156543	They can still be shocked by such carnage .	Even they 're politicians .	if
0	76113	Frozen food had been located .	There was more than enough for this leg of the journey .	and
0	120079	Julian changed his course .	Turned into that direction .	and
0	113999	Just as udgd lowers his axe , he hears a loud crash .	Feels a strange sensation .	and
1	108782	To reaching her limit .	Quickly she was close .	because
3	771	She said to never return , michael said .	Even i wanted to go .	if
2	114061	Her efforts would be too late for her mother not for future residents , and .	That was why , perhaps a little naively , she was at the hospital pleading to be allowed to enter their portals to seek donations .	but
0	2832	We got into the first taxi , which arrived .	Helen took the front seat right next to the driver .	and
2	86426	When murdoch had seen nikolai earlier , he 'd been content .	He 'd still been pallid , still lean .	but
0	44205	They were running some training skirmishes when you called .	Had some things to clean up before they get back to the ship .	and
2	147217	I turned to amelia , hoping for some respite from this unfair admonishment .	She was allied with her aunt , her expression ashen and pale and she turned away from me and made her way with her head hung low into the drawing room .	but
0	147432	Jiskira said , pulling out what appeared to be a watch-like device and strapped it to his wrist .	Rummaged in a little compartment .	and
0	51692	A small sphere of blue fire exploded in the air over the bluff .	Was echoed by a second sphere over the other bluff .	and
0	19493	Aidan glanced over at isaacs right arm , still exposed from the fight with duncan .	Saw that his three seals hadnt changed .	and
2	100000	He had the option to shoot at lower velocity to be comparatively silent .	Experience had shown him that such shots could fail to have the same terminal effect that he got when he blew a ghouls skull completely apart , which even when successful had the added disadvantage that he splattered infectious blood and brain matter all over the work area .	but
4	138382	Just like the time i wore the red glittery platform shoes , ! '' .	I should 've worn blue .	when
4	159336	Something serious had to be wrong .	He began to doubt everything ink had told him .	when
3	79119	She could face her past .	Presley and aaron could continue to brave rehab .	if
2	63691	Emily reached for it .	Ali caught her and pulled her back with surprising strength .	but
0	94834	It only fair to them i should share the risk .	In the event , though i did not draw the lot , there was no avoiding it .	and
3	74809	To investigate and see .	We have an issue .	if
1	29551	You mad at me .	You thought i was stalking you .	because
0	159267	Watched this and captured their idiocy on tape .	Showed the professors , hey why should i work hard and get an a while these guys cheat .	and
2	23078	The other arrow missed striking anything solid .	Lodged in the folds of the vord queen 's cloak .	but
0	39575	Only twice had i gotten a flicker of a signal from a vampire brain .	It had been like a flash of electricity in an outage .	and
0	44057	Realizing what i had let slip , i got up from my chair .	Went over to the window to hide the fact that i was blushing .	and
2	48888	He was still rambling on .	It clearly does not interest me , when he starts naming them in latin .	but
3	47176	To intercept the goblet .	The nate at the school fails .	if
2	40241	There was a certain enchantment , a certain pain , even a certain emptiness to it .	She would not let such bewildering contradictions taint this glorious moment , for there was still much left to anticipate , beyond the destination itself .	but
4	80072	Another loss had occurred earlier that morning .	Lanma , bo , mo , and jo announced that they were leaving .	when
2	60723	To do and read .	Fish , cook , sleep , eat , f**k .	but
0	13803	I had studied it in detail for lectures .	Recalled immediately the tiara the empress was wearing in the painting .	and
2	69797	Moon found something in their blood .	He cant identify it .	but
0	139383	Both men were talking at the same time .	Njuguna was waving his arms in bold gestures .	and
0	51216	To protect you from him .	I had to pretend i had a headache so nobody would know that i was interfering .	and
0	97588	There was a faint rustling .	Then jocelyn could see lucien making his way up the stairs , closely followed by amadeus .	and
0	156066	I 've snapped submerged into the darkness where imaginary things walk , talk and are real to me , but no one .	Fallen off the cliff called reality .	and
3	53201	She 'd be lost .	He wrapped his incredible arms around her .	if
0	158377	He tapped a tile rather lightly with the hammer .	It not only shattered into pieces , it disintegrated into a fine white powder .	and
4	59776	Still lost in thought .	I heard a noise behind me .	when
2	55627	`` animal blood will sustain you . '' .	It will never satisfy you .	but
0	11658	The waters of the pool rippled .	Kalarus 's image , like gaius 's had , fell back into droplets of water that splashed back into the pool .	and
1	43903	He 'd relived that night to the department 's satisfaction , and because he wanted official closure on tony 's death .	Only he too had violated procedure by checking on max while on duty .	because
2	88097	My lungs burned for air .	My mouth and nose were filled with ice .	but
2	159072	She smiled and tilted her head in a gesture of polite greeting .	Received no response from an open-mouthed , glassy-eyed dean cook .	but
4	94800	A sob exploded out of katelyns throat .	Her mother reached her arm around her shoulder .	when
0	124401	Tim 's been stealing your work .	Passing it off as his own .	and
2	73459	The sudden increase in noise from the street below did not distract her .	Instead caused her to put her head closer to theirs in case they missed anything she had to say .	but
3	122093	She would at least be able to stop in and see nathan while she was .	She was gone from simon 's life .	if
4	100283	He had remembered to do it earlier .	Dave was merrily showering everyone with marmalade .	when
4	42103	They needed , or have him begin furycrafting .	They were farthest from any support , and where even the first lord himself might eventually be overwhelmed by enemy numbers .	when
4	134896	Every day i would walk to that field and read on my new data pad for hours , watching the poppies nod their heads around me .	My father thought i was playing upstairs .	when
4	75993	I had peculiar feelings and impressions .	I came to this stand .	when
0	34650	My fate is fulfilled .	Your fate will sooner or later descend upon you .	and
1	124842	A security guard appeared at the door .	Julie had telepathically sent for one .	because
0	103325	She turned her head slowly , and said , `` everyone ate my brother .	Looked at me , dead in the eye .	and
0	35481	If it wasnt , then i would win the argument .	I would torment tara with that fact for the rest of her natural life .	and
0	102452	The egyptian pyramids started as tombs .	Slowly progressed into houses of worship and learning .	and
0	29029	Tarren moved over to his desk .	Pulled out some paper and a pen .	and
1	148997	Then i put my head back on the ground and so of course my hair was covered with vomit .	I couldnt hold up my head as it was both exhausting and painful .	because
2	71484	The possibility of losing her business was still devastating .	She 'd survived a lot .	but
2	86072	She wanted to believe it was due to the physical exertion .	Knew there was more to it .	but
1	144967	And he 'd only landed that job .	All the other guys had been busy in the field .	because
0	66397	This was not the time or place .	Although he had glutted himself , he could not stop the thrill that shot through him .	and
0	4280	There is also magic .	If youre not used to it , or prepared for it , it can be overwhelming .	and
4	98338	He reached behind him .	He appeared to be standing in front of it .	when
0	132560	This elicited a moan of yearning , letting seth get a full view .	I opened my thighs .	and
4	8081	Returned to evelyns desk .	I heard the strumming , gentle , behind me .	when
3	4416	He 'd be thought an odd part of the fabric design-assuming , that was .	Even he was noticed .	if
0	65077	She wiped her face .	Her hand came away smeared with blood .	and
1	70730	I loved him-if i .	Truly loved him-would i hesitate .	because
4	127431	A burglar alarm went off , causing him to flee halfway down the lawn before he remembered there were no cops to answer .	He broke a window to gain entry .	when
3	136430	The paper would not have existed .	He didnt know frank meldrum down at bell .	if
4	15797	He jerked his hand back at the last minute .	He heard a muffled sound .	when
3	31881	Bonnie was smart and resourceful-even .	She was only beginning to find that out herself .	if
0	28814	I lit the oil lamps .	Laid out the equipment as he suggested .	and
0	102647	Knowing that one serving would never satisfy vigholf , rhona pushed her bowl of stew across the table and .	Let him devour that as wel .	and
4	44839	Riding off into the sunset .	Dirk kicks the horse .	when
2	29489	It takes me a little bit of digging .	I finally find a pair of army-green pants and a long-sleeved cotton t-shirt .	but
0	55933	No one would help him .	Now whom could he trust .	and
0	10920	The surprise rippled through the room .	I knew that someone who knew me would see me if i didnt leave .	and
0	13730	Rearrange teams ? '' .	Get the girl out .	and
3	67537	Then why would they have left the central dominance , the place where the mists were the weakest .	The people of the city had fled .	if
1	8086	The bastards probably wanted to break up harte-madison . '' .	They knew the company would try to block their plans to establish this damned think tank .	because
0	20319	One had a ricelike grain .	The smallest contained a handful of fresh greens .	and
3	41004	And , just yell . '' .	You need me for anything .	if
0	15836	She snapped as the girl with pitiful eyes .	Attempted to defend herself .	and
4	31398	Of course you would want us to destroy a kalakrn .	You face that which crawls out of it .	when
2	65814	`` one day , some guy is going to come along and .	He 's going to be everything you ever wanted .	but
3	136201	He could be feeding us false information .	Krager really knows what we 're doing .	if
4	76599	We recognize it because we have in our mind the concept , or form , of a perfect chair .	We see any particular chair .	when
1	7747	It must have impinged on serena 's consciousness .	Her gaze swung back to him , a sad mockery in her eyes .	because
0	129487	I didnt want to waste a lot of time on this .	It certainly didnt bear sipping , prolonging my disgust for an hour or more , a little shot of revolting nastiness at a time .	and
4	59245	He rasped , `` why are you crying ? '' .	Two more tears tracked down her now heated cheeks .	when
3	132389	Which , had ratcheted up three notches while her own personal safe , snug , warm cocoon fit around her .	It could be believed .	if
3	126252	It was difficult to take in .	Especially you were german .	if
2	18279	The convoy 'll come , he 'll be the hero and we 'll get the hell outta here , okay ? '' .	He 'll be outnumbered .	but
2	20873	It 's confusing . '' .	It 's something that i want to try .	but
0	37466	One of the lines was bogus .	I knew it would take us to the doctor .	and
0	156043	Wolfing down a sandwich .	Sucking on a pop .	and
2	117515	It 's probably better if i follow his instructions .	There 's some sadistic part of me that 's too pissed these two idiots got the jump on me , and it 's not going to let me or them go quietly into the night .	but
4	125607	I had my aids compile a document of your whole life .	I first heard your name spoken during a report i received two days .	when
2	68263	Not only had she been handed unexpected and painful info rmation .	She 'd heard it through eavesdropping .	but
4	10566	To depart and leave the mastery to their sons .	These were come to full stature of body and mind .	when
3	20808	Rachel made a mental note to never , never , get marianne mad .	It could possibly be avoided .	if
2	117103	They come in , they yell , they scream .	They can not go beyond that front counter .	but
4	92872	Samuel amiable began to wonder what was going to happen .	He began pondering the idea that he was no longer walking on the same planet that he had .	when
1	107801	Carmen secretly frowned in silence .	The override directives in her inorganic parallel brain intervened to turn her expression .	because
2	20521	There were new commanding voices .	They were not on the other side of the bedroom wall .	but
4	83484	I can will my soul back into my own body .	The spell is undone .	when
1	55040	Carolyn had moved from cleveland to new york city and her shrewdness and skills at the negotiating table could provide even more money than she had .	Mainly she could walk rather than drive a car .	because
2	149466	She knew she was going to be heading home today .	It was little moments like this that made spending the night at kains worthwhile .	but
2	89272	She thought about saying no .	Mentally said screw it .	but
0	73855	Her father could change me into a merman .	I could go away forever to neptune 's depths .	and
4	39733	`` there was a time , '' he reminded her pointedly , `` . '' .	Being middle class would have been an improvement .	when
0	5402	Placing one hand on his hip and pulling out a white cloth .	Reaching the other into his pants ' waistband .	and
2	30399	He 'd told sarah once it was a matter of intimidation .	She 'd always thought there was probably a little ego involved .	but
2	96840	I thought eating with my friends would make it easier on us both .	Whole time , i just wanted them all to leave us .	but
4	141241	They realized the gravity of the situation .	He explained how he got the cia and fbi into the picture .	when
4	113178	My mother met her years ago in a modiste 's shop .	My parents used to live in france .	when
2	123986	When the woman who brought you here dies , you will tell him to awaken , and .	He will awaken long enough to help you escape from the mean people .	but
3	41010	That given how i baffle you .	The situation were reversed .	if
0	80806	Reece shifted her weight .	Her usual sanctimonious expression returned .	and
0	55239	That had been abandoned .	Seemed to be the source of the nasty smell .	and
3	6003	It is a question of my physical ability .	This frame will even hold up to such torture .	if
2	21333	It incredibly hard to focus .	She did her best .	but
2	43782	They hardly stood out against the stony creek bed .	Robles was right-on close inspection the arrangement looked man-made .	but
0	18887	He sat directly under the central chandelier .	It made a blaze of his long red hair .	and
2	106068	He wanted to make it messy to clean up .	He thought about ella .	but
0	99453	He nodded , but barely paid them any attention as he hit the button on his remote .	Briefly returned their greetings .	and
0	11535	One day he wakes .	Decides he 's tired of fighting and that i 'm not really worth it in the end .	and
0	41736	Kira lay still on the front table with closed eyes , but she felt herself fall for him a little bit more the longer he spoke .	Was sure he had captivated the entire classroom as he read romeos lines .	and
0	104212	Long was turin thy son fostered in the halls of menegroth ; and it was not by the king 's will nor by mine that he came never back to doriath .	Shown love and honour as the son of the king .	and
4	94511	Not really sure what place her brother-in-law had in the room .	She was naked and postorgasmic .	when
0	59556	Some of her neighbours were arrested , tortured .	Killed for failing to notify the local militia of warvic 's presence as an npa sympathiser .	and
2	24901	Graham sat so still he might have been carved into the chair .	His chest rose and fell .	but
3	108365	The images could get lost .	Even someone else were to see their own version of what i had experienced .	if
2	155665	The prince , ignoring their jeers , kicked the horses side with his heels and .	Galloped into the temple .	but
0	46111	Most of me was pure fey .	We know how to keep a secret .	and
3	60247	`` but , i 'm open to it . '' .	You had something in mind .	if
4	60777	To bite her upper lip .	She tried to gather her thoughts .	when
0	141668	Miranda made a funny face .	Kylie took off to her room to get dressed .	and
4	140355	He put his hands on my waist and half-lifted , half-pushed me toward the head of the bed .	He had me nude .	when
2	15161	Instead , he tried to remove the witch 's curse , and she refused .	When that failed , the shaman met with the witch and begged her to remove the spell .	but
2	135544	It was a little difficult to make them understand what we wanted , at first , and i have learnt a little of theirs as we came closer : it is not very difficult , and there are many bits which are like durzagh . '' .	Some of them understood the xhosa language , which i had got a little of from demane and sipho .	but
0	23543	He made his way around the island .	Took a seat on a barstool next to mine .	and
2	138273	So had my girl and her mother as two separate groups that must have collided in the foyer or in the dark theatre .	The `` forker and his dad had been going to the cinema , and .	but
2	121117	I am very fond of the ladies of the ll ( i grew up under their watchful gazes .	There is something to be said for small doses .	but
2	145130	I left home to get away from it and i 've always tried to keep him in some kind of check .	Today he was drunk and he hit her .	but
2	124112	Attempted to move away from him .	He held on to me .	but
4	37757	How much less was in it .	He 'd arrived earlier in the afternoon .	when
2	57963	I 've seen the hard work and money .	Now i 'm seeing other things .	but
1	13767	I came . '' .	I felt close to you .	because
4	85847	`` from where they would have got such things , it 's really unique '' goku said .	He got quite down on that sort of beds or whatever they were .	when
4	7005	But , qi would see how it felt .	He got the ark .	when
1	93886	He missed his volkswagen .	It had been his first new car , a gift at high school graduation , and it was paid for , unlike the saab .	because
4	120277	She even lent me her name .	It came time to give birth .	when
0	66312	Still the cancer kept growing , as the blood from the building river filtered through the enlarged cancerous pores .	It all headed in the direction of the black abyss .	and
2	157660	It 's frivolous of me , i know . '' .	I believe i enjoy the lap of luxury .	but
4	63286	`` so , '' greta said ? '' .	Kay had finished relaying the conversation she and gideon had overheard , `` where do we go from .	when
2	130785	His face was still flat and empty .	His eyes were ablaze with the anticipation of a fight .	but
0	17621	Who inspired the story .	Challenged me to write it .	and
0	81547	Jeanne louise slid in .	Did up her seat belt as he walked around to the driver 's side .	and
0	114561	1916 was three years ago . '' .	He 's shown no sign of mental instability whatsoever according to my friends at austin .	and
2	158330	I have a jacket on .	It 's still so cold .	but
2	100197	His fingers are okay .	His shoulder aches a bitch .	but
2	58851	She had intended to curl up with a hot milk drink and goodie whemper 's notebooks on experimental astrology .	Instinct told her that any suitor should have an uphill struggle put in front of him , just to make him keener .	but
4	13819	Once that was established , he could finish them off .	They were at their most vulnerable .	when
2	80400	I 'll go along with it for now . '' .	If we find anything else , i 'm talking to my dad .	but
3	32663	`` but casey that l-leaves us with n-nothing . '' .	You take your sled .	if
0	99070	Nothing was trivial to the man .	It was all written down on one of these pages .	and
2	15089	Teddie was ready for a nap during the three-hour drive .	She could tell that michelle wanted to talk .	but
4	148952	How could it make her weak , to entrust herself and her safety to someone .	It took a lot of strength to give up that level of control .	when
4	61521	The nursing staff had been both aggravated and thrilled at my posse .	I was put in my private room the night before .	when
1	121292	I have not reproduced .	I am a messenger , not a father .	because
4	38252	She would cry out in agony .	Someone used the same skills near her .	when
4	1641	The same car was still behind him .	He made his way to the light at sunset .	when
2	56893	She had reached in the middle of the lawn .	To her surprise no ghost approached her .	but
4	39432	He knew that it could end their friendship , his career , even his life if she repeated his words to the town .	Toby told janey what he told her next .	when
0	155762	He pulled out a pair of thin copper flasks .	Tossed one to sorren .	and
2	74179	He 's always said i should get in touch with him .	I brushed it off , so there is no way i 'm calling dad to tell him i 'm seeing jake tomorrow .	but
4	15611	He sat and watched the stars appear one by one against a backdrop of black velvet .	He 'd finished his meal .	when
0	80169	Seth tuned them out .	Hurried over to the door .	and
0	152434	He looked ahead , but it was on a bridge over top of a large lake .	Saw the train was indeed coming to a stop .	and
0	20218	Gives me unconditional pleasure .	I let her feel that .	and
0	89132	Danny is unconscious and they really want in .	There 's a lot of very angry troopers outside our door .	and
2	3563	Its not like i intentionally did this , i had not hurt any of them .	They acted so aggressively as if i had asked to me dubbed this title of monster .	but
0	58820	The librarian crossed his arms over his chest .	Gave me a pointed stare .	and
0	41813	I sat up stood .	Placed my feet on the floor .	and
2	23949	They disliked his hectoring manners .	They respected him for his know-how and his drive and his dedication .	but
4	33391	I had to take a stand .	Their discussion ended and the attention turned back to me .	when
2	102471	The high prelate continued .	Then i heard other reports .	but
0	18639	Dodging through the swarm of bodies , i ran across the sidewalk , landed on my feet in the middle of the asphalt raised both guns .	Slid over the hood of a passing car .	and
2	153836	Maybe i am drunk and im not fuckin stupid and im not fuckin dead .	They say im crazy .	but
2	140041	It was a hoarse , dry laugh .	It didnt sound forced to me .	but
2	151084	His once fat face had thinned due to starvation .	His stretched , drooping skin still jiggled as he laughed spitefully , thats right you sanctimonious fool .	but
4	146929	Had met again at a mutual friends wedding .	They decided to begin seeing each other .	when
2	61895	Nick mumbled something against her throat .	His thoughts remained a mystery , for within seconds his deep , even breathing told her he slept .	but
2	111298	To ( becomes more sick .	Pushes forward ) i was talking to this guy .	but
2	94503	He 's going to be incensed about this , and i know that eventually he 'll love having his name on you . '' .	He 'll get over it .	but
3	158499	Thats the trap , see .	You just opened this here book and tried to read it and nobody came by for a few days you might die of thirst or hunger .	if
2	51495	Know i 've let my house become an obsession .	It 's because i belong in echo beach , meg .	but
0	136074	He paused should he decide to give her more than just a kiss of his tail .	She sprang to her haunches , ready to move .	and
2	106578	I know you love this life .	I have never been all that fond of farming .	but
2	54966	She 'd found out that he was massively wealthy .	He never spent a penny on the town unless he had to .	but
2	129596	Why they 'd stopped so suddenly , prostrate on the floor by her feet .	Then turned back to the man she 'd approached to find him on his knees .	but
4	28156	Simard was constantly being watched under veron , but not killed .	Veron came into power .	when
4	75321	'' whitney predicted happily , `` . '' .	I tell him that i think your gowns are much too demure and that when we 're in london i intend to make certain you buy more like this one to wear at the parties we shall be attending .	when
3	139158	It 's fredrik gustavsson .	Anyone can get through an interrogation without breaking .	if
4	152099	But , the tags go home with them as a keepsake ornament . '' .	The families come to cut down the tree .	when
0	77696	The cheerful fairy coughed .	Fiddled with the buttons on her sensible woolly jumper .	and
0	70844	He roughly shook the boy .	Snarled at him to show spirit .	and
1	28801	Elle had heard that part .	She showed no reaction to his words .	because
0	105114	Elend smiled to the general .	Clubs scowled back-which was generally accepted as clubs 's version of a smile .	and
2	144394	We have no desire to harm or kill .	Every time a sentient species develops the voidwarp technology , they must be taught not to use it .	but
0	117402	They had become friends .	Soon after , robbie had succeeded in getting him seconded to his group as permanent guide .	and
2	112025	At the time , i just thought it was part of being a big time movie producer .	Maybe theres more to it .	but
3	141867	Legolas was ever glancing from side to side , and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the wood .	Gimli had allowed it .	if
2	87514	The rain started within twenty minutes of arriving .	Our spirits were boosted when we discovered juliet 's brothers had left behind quite the stash of liquor when they 'd visited the week .	but
0	6813	Signing her name on the screen .	Swiping her index finger imprint .	and
0	77332	One of the ventilator grilles blew off .	Shot across the kitchen like a projectile .	and
2	106163	It was a beautiful morning .	There was a heavy quality to the air that suggested it would be hot and humid by midafternoon .	but
4	30786	Ashley was barely dressed .	She answered the door .	when
0	80329	He 'd given her a family .	Taught her things about herself she 'd never known .	and
0	6435	He 's just being .	He appears to be very powerful .	and
2	76809	Sara 's purse hit the ground , splat , and sans the phony imitative leather `` skin '' or the three-inch spike heels .	Spilled as she took a defensive carrot-tay stance , looking for all the world like a black emma peel .	but
3	42371	What do you think would happen , muffed it , then tried to leave the i.s. ? '' .	I went after a leprechaun .	if
0	69970	Finally my swords came into view .	I felt a little better knowing at least i was armed and ready for whatever came my way .	and
2	54612	Ibrahim raced out of the mess hall to the left .	He and asgar clapped each other on both shoulders in farewell , and .	but
3	53627	And those individuals have historically been held to a different standard by the law , with lesser rights and privileges than other civilians .	Even they survive the change .	if
2	144125	Had she been the one standing , he wouldnt have hesitated to get another chair , after all his mother and his two older sisters had raised him .	He was at a loss right now on how to proceed at many levels that had nothing to do with being a gentleman .	but
0	129032	By chance the bedroom 's thick curtains had been drawn , or else elyna would never have awoken .	Kept the sun at bay .	and
2	30551	The hie had been as cutthroat as he 'd expected - and - the witch had had the last laugh .	He 'd been prepared to be .	but
1	90465	You can ignore the rest .	You 're better than them .	because
2	97817	I felt hot and dazed .	I was very much aware of the throbbing ache between my legs .	but
2	104881	After putting the dish in the oven to heat , he started to look around for something to go with it .	The garden caught his attention , drawing him to the kitchen window .	but
0	21366	The rain continued unabated .	The dimpled surface of the lake was the colour of lead .	and
0	138232	Her gaze darted over , just for a moment .	She met the bright stare of detective gyth .	and
2	40045	It tasted like pine trees smell .	The ache in my head disappeared .	but
0	71275	Meet my old man .	Get this over with .	and
3	117550	Then maybe you should think about burying him out back here someplace where no one will ever know he was killed by your dogs .	You dont want to get in trouble with the police .	if
2	121068	Time and grief had worked their will on him .	He was still unbent , a big-boned , broad-shouldered , barrel-chested man with features as strong and sharp as some old eagle .	but
3	95912	She 'll break my head , i figure it 's better to be careful .	I burn these out .	if
4	63308	The first two overseers died .	She heaved the ax into their necks , slashing back and forth between them .	when
0	102386	Near the door , i stop , using the shadows to conceal my presence .	Press myself up against the building .	and
3	32728	Through the rear window , she can see the forest 's black walls squeezing the road .	Her past is a book whose covers are slowly , inexorably closing .	if
2	79901	She was a comet of mist , staying well ahead of the trailing poison .	Something of her was left .	but
2	55886	It was turning into something of a habit .	Then enjoyable things often do .	but
0	800	He pressed a kiss to the top of my head .	We both tightened our grips .	and
2	119023	I could not have been happier at the time .	As it turned out , the longer rest only made us stiff by the time our half hour was .	but
2	102173	She had little choice .	To protect her sister .	but
4	27276	I could see him through the front picture window .	He got to the living room and took off his cap .	when
0	155972	Richard put the gun on the desk .	Picked up a syringe .	and
2	90532	He knew both legs were probably broken .	His stunned body had yet to send to his brain the signals of agony which the crushed bones and flesh would soon begin transmitting .	but
4	102625	The contract could never be voided .	No one would ever want to marry the baron as per the exit clause .	when
4	44006	Suddenly , the stick fell from her hands , oh .	She turned her sad eyes upon me .	when
0	72713	Ice had assumed they already had a movie in mind when he heard from lynn .	Apparently the girls did , just not the same movie .	and
2	98791	You need to heal . '' .	When you 're well , i want to see how your control holds up to my lion .	but
4	39622	Still he 'd gone to his knees .	He 'd finally picked up her scent once more .	when
3	43731	Remote a possibility as that might seem , this cache would still contain them .	Someone was accessing those files .	if
0	125169	We have commonised as silence .	Taken as meaning no sound .	and
0	144551	He gave her a quick , easy smile .	Then looked at carson .	and
0	21855	She spread out her arms .	Looked up at the ceiling .	and
2	100736	She was much too serious and reserved .	You know that kind of face , the kind which you know that if it smiled would be beautiful .	but
2	53615	His hair curled over his neck , black and thick .	Cut short of his shoulders .	but
0	100396	Then she briskly picked up the keys .	Walked to the stationery cupboard with what she hoped was the purposeful step of someone about to check on the supply of pencils .	and
2	107851	A full-color palette returned .	Forms continued to be ambiguous .	but
4	3485	I didnt want you to feel tied to me .	I thought that you had simply moved on with your life .	when
2	135856	It was awfully gross and bitter .	She always felt better .	but
3	66343	`` '' hansum said smiling , `` then you are a bull . '' .	She is a cow .	if
0	642	They waited in awkward silence for the phone to stop ringing .	Then eleanor shifted her weight .	and
0	109129	Shawna climbed onto miras .	Orin followed , wrapping his arms around her waist .	and
0	145370	Your grandmother was a real nice woman .	People tell me your dad and mom were good people .	and
3	96772	This year is crucial .	You want to qualify for the london olympics .	if
0	41801	He hit with more force than he was used to .	Had to roll with the impact .	and
0	71397	She remembered wanting to go .	She remembered asking rhea if their business was done .	and
0	62417	To bring along dozens and dozens of foot soldiers .	As a result there were regular old footprints .	and
4	20630	Him estranged from his brother .	He could have been working toward reconciliation .	when
2	151376	Others believed the rules were legitimate and the billionaire was .	Thought the rules were advisory guides only and could be bent a little .	but
4	100208	`` and i 'm okay . '' .	I 'm the driver and know i have control of the situation .	when
0	65064	Immediately , davydds daemon stepped forward , killing him and causing a second explosion of rock and flying splinters that carved a broad swath out of the imperial soldiers , who had no idea what had hit them .	Brought its mace down on the bloodmage .	and
3	132897	I 'm completely done for , and i want to stay mad .	He gets his hands on me .	if
2	139756	Nathaniel had seen this done many times .	He never liked it .	but
2	50235	She would also have appreciated a visit to the lavatory .	The short time they had spent in india had taught her that outside the bigger hotels this was often as much of an ordeal as a relief .	but
4	47716	With some caution-after all , it had been broad daylight .	She 'd seen the boy the first time-she approached the first window .	when
2	152816	He poured a cup of coffee .	Never took a sip .	but
3	39360	Some stranger soon would have .	One of us hadnt bought the place .	if
2	131673	The original profile was for a man in his thirties .	That was assuming the killer started killing when he himself was younger .	but
3	30624	One more photo shoot would cover him until he was healed .	He still needed more after that .	if
2	19334	It 's not surprising since they came .	That 's not all .	but
0	102037	He tormented her breast with his tongue .	Was relentless in his tasting of her .	and
2	105740	This country wouldnt exist .	I prefer to let others do the speculating .	but
2	89083	A lot of people do .	Most dont know it .	but
4	106070	And though she 'd earned her paycheck fair and square , she 'd felt like a hooker .	She 'd taken the money from him and thanked him for breakfast .	when
0	7594	She ate a banana .	Stirred granola into her yogurt .	and
0	10839	As mary could neither read nor write she organised the youngsters before elvis stood them on the scales sent them to the front of the queue .	Wrote a number on a scrap of paper .	and
2	23161	Alexandra telephoned her two or three times a week .	Eve was either out or too busy to see her .	but
2	156629	Foltrigg was eager to return to new orleans .	More eager to hear from mark sway .	but
2	10754	What john paul 's connection to the cathedral was .	Whatever it was , he must have had some special entre .	but
2	157810	The thought was solid enough to wake me .	The blanket of flower petals tucked itself under my chin , like a mother tucking you in when you are very small , and again i had that feeling that nothing could harm me .	but
3	40692	I will take you down to the first floor .	You give me a moment to collect the mail which is to be posted .	if
1	111192	Realised that it was in bulmers interest to keep many of his clients hanging on .	They could often be useful for other things .	because
3	53553	Where , they could spend some time making out .	Things went as he hoped .	if
3	105031	Still , they can be yours .	Only you can know love .	if
0	130086	I could have spoken up right then and made him look bad .	Admitted to all my lies .	and
2	14981	I slept probably a half hour .	I tossed and turned frequently and woke with snippets of dreams rolling around in my head .	but
2	44223	My immediate response was to decline the post .	A personal appeal from miss duval had me reverse that decision .	but
4	67338	Merry christmas , '' thom and paula shouted .	She opened the door .	when
0	26175	She was tied to a table .	He was thinking of how he could bring her such pleasure she 'd drown in it .	and
0	71517	She put her foot in the stirrup .	Swung up into the saddle .	and
2	149505	Even thinking about it .	Suddenly i realized how strange it was that people could avoid each other so successfully in a small , remote log cabin .	but
4	159223	But , as instructed , i find it quite hard to pull the trigger , and i add a finger from my left hand to help my right .	I hold the gun out at arm 's length .	when
3	10709	It would have been too much to have people here waiting for her .	Even it was her mom and dad .	if
2	26980	Never in my life did i think i 'd enjoy the taste of squirrel .	It was actually delicious .	but
0	150744	What pretty slave bracelets ... '' nefertiti had examined them all .	Had even tried removing kady 's .	and
4	126502	Eryn was destroyed , and she 's been single ever since .	She discovered kevin had cheated on her .	when
2	78947	The hair on his chest was a matter of amusement to her .	When he pretended to be hurt she laughed and told him that she loved it because it belonged to her man .	but
3	4011	`` it would be best , '' he said , `` .	You were prepared to explain what occurred on flight 545 .	if
4	2944	Was a little surprised .	The burly bouncer at the head of the line waved me over .	when
4	68087	Vilma would do everything - even sell her soul - to make sure her little mairi was safe .	Push came to shove .	when
2	4567	As had all the girls back home in ohio when they 'd first found out james franco was studying for a phd in english .	Love was something magical and mysterious to her .	but
4	152408	Outside the norm , rich and karla comin ' out .	Snow 's on the ground , '' chace remarked .	when
0	76922	I also felt his thighs squeeze the horse .	It slowed to a stop .	and
0	87399	But right in front of you is the bedroom .	That is where your love sleeps .	and
4	49307	He turned it over and over .	She handed him the wrecked disk .	when
2	64178	You 'll have to come to the station and you should have them back within a week or two . '' .	Claim them all and fill out the paperwork .	but
0	106500	That could run away from nearly everything .	Make the few that could catch up seriously regret it .	and
0	104841	My uncle had a great job as a city bus driver .	My aunt was the principal at my high school .	and
2	113085	`` he is ... , before i knew all of this .	... there 's this , uh , complication i was going to talk to you about tonight .	but
0	12447	He could lie down on me .	We could still look into each other 's eyes .	and
4	61420	It must have looked absurd , but so did most of eureka 's actions .	She opened the car door for polaris to fly in .	when
0	143712	As if he was trying to distinguish him from them , his head was leaned .	His eyes looked downward at the traffickers .	and
0	135770	The land was auctioned .	It 's been bought and sold half a dozen times since .	and
0	130104	It was most annoying , especially when two of them , evers , and arras ( a spaniard who had taken commission with the crown because his father had been english ) , accosted him .	Tried to engage him in a friendly hand or two .	and
0	51810	I 'd wasted enough time f**king around , staring at sandwiches , stealing kisses and touches .	Feeding from a human female .	and
3	124755	`` and , everyone will assume we were involved in this massacre and that we 're only trying to cover our tracks . '' .	Our people get caught snooping there without permission .	if
1	67755	He 'd looked into me .	That was what i 'd do .	because
2	46536	The forest was almost silent in the stillness just before dawn .	Cirrus , her wind fury , carried every tiny sound to her ears as clearly as if it 'd been a voice speaking from directly beside her .	but
1	44567	Her face must have revealed her confusion .	When she did not answer , katherine waved her hand .	because
0	125787	Liam finished his tea .	Set it down on the tray .	and
1	149430	She was no ghost to budda .	She was still alive as far as he knew .	because
3	41861	It 'd be better . '' .	You were to wake .	if
0	77227	Which they had just ridden .	Turned to look out of reflex .	and
4	115453	Or at least he always seemed to be frowning , ever since the hedgehog incident ( which really , honestly , had not been her fault .	He was in the presence of miss alexia tarabotti .	when
1	104967	I drop my purse on the real leather couch-i know it 's real .	I can smell it-and move across the room .	because
4	74176	She has always been slow to judge .	It came to recognizing danger when it stood in front of her .	when
3	20567	Whisper to ben , `` .	You hurt him , parish , i 'm sticking this knife into your heart .	if
2	27249	He 'd given up everything .	Moving doggedly through life .	but
0	47543	He spun , twisting .	Hurled me like a bowling ball .	and
2	150154	`` we can stay as long as you like . '' .	We do have a three-hour drive ahead of us .	but
4	34850	Well , i was about six or seven .	All that stuff happened , colonel .	when
3	47572	It would be the same for humans .	They could only sire one time george said .	if
1	159789	But hopefully there was an explanation .	I really needed one .	because
2	7843	You just had to live in a hydro-powered factory and kill a few people to get to this point .	Whats important is that you got to this point .	but
4	14888	Aly 's house seemed to mock me .	I got out of the car and stared at it .	when
2	152770	I have to stay mostly out of sight until they catch the guy who murdered nicole , and .	I 'm ready for this to be .	but
2	37569	She could feel the force of his stare on her .	She refused to look up at him .	but
0	119822	She licked her lips .	Looked away from him .	and
2	121930	Rachel didnt have any love for the vile little informant either .	Knight had crossed a line he didnt even seem to know was .	but
2	99419	He was kept busy with various calls .	It was one from his wife , lily , that made lauren 's heart melt .	but
4	131031	You were so calm .	Even he tried to hold the door open .	when
0	22152	I remove one of my knives from its sheath .	Draw the stone along its edge .	and
2	6427	I wont let myself get hooked .	This cant be an act .	but
2	151972	My bold move causes a small gasp to pass between her lips .	She makes no move to pull .	but
2	61048	`` i can guard her , '' ash told them , `` .	I wanted you guys to know why if i 'm not here , another guard needs to be .	but
2	2878	Smearing blood along the floor , she crawled into the kitchen and her hand was shaky .	Pulled a gun out of her jacket .	but
2	8787	Rocco ran wildly along the beach to her relief , stayed away from the water .	Kicking up a sand storm .	but
0	138620	We both turned to face her .	I guess the dead thing in the yard came into her line of sight because she said , `` ew .	and
0	31456	She could remember she had put that awful thing to her lips .	Failed to make it sing .	and
2	144001	She looked surprised for a moment .	Then gave a small smile .	but
2	160435	They pleaded with the guards to at least remove him , lest they all get sick .	That only served to reaffirm the guards convictions that they were doing the right thing by locking them up in the first place .	but
0	62976	The driver had overcorrected for the skid .	Sent the car into a spin .	and
2	36729	I didnt want to look .	He was hard to ignore .	but
0	137446	To open her arms .	Take him to her breast .	and
0	153083	`` but she has suffered abuse . '' .	It 's very apparent .	and
2	60791	He 'd heard her in the shower a while ago and the water was off now and he was awake , listening to elise getting dressed behind the closed door .	Had allowed himself a few minutes ' sleep where he sat on the floor .	but
1	73610	When we were little and you wouldnt eat cheesecake .	You couldnt imagine how cheese and cake would taste nice .	because
0	120094	Fortunately the bullet was lodged in my flack jacket .	Had not pierced the skin so i was still in one piece .	and
0	142463	He was dressed in nondescript clothing , but he carried a rifle that looked shiny and well kept .	It was in better condition than anything the rebels wore .	and
2	33403	Umma liked to talk as she worked .	Arya could not understand a word she said .	but
0	125236	I could simply walk to the stable .	Just duck down quite a bit .	and
3	81935	Damn it nikole , you dont know .	You can trust him .	if
4	82677	But , she had no choice but to stop dead in her tracks .	Kat turned a corner .	when
2	111026	Dizzy felt his voice wavering .	Forced himself to continue .	but
0	28356	She ripped off the mask .	Tried to scramble from the stretcher .	and
0	71346	A stream of blood ran down his face .	The falcon came for him .	and
4	113131	My mind flashed to our lovemaking last night .	He 'd bitten and marked me and suggested i choke him .	when
0	7948	Joel stood to stretch his legs .	Walked over to professor fitch .	and
0	156197	He is absolutely certain that you will have no problems .	He thinks that one day you will become one of the great mages of vimar .	and
3	158877	I had to know before i took my last breath .	Even i were to die after learning the truth .	if
4	148161	She saw the surprise in his face .	She turned back to mico .	when
3	69759	We gladly await their explanation for this .	Those in your company are british .	if
4	4732	Peter was still watching him with amusement .	Emma came barreling around the side of the church .	when
2	45633	Bliss chased away the gray and .	Made everything seem black and white .	but
3	70640	Max had understood what she had endured as a blood slave .	Even it was nowhere near as hideous as the torture and abuse he had suffered .	if
3	37039	There is no tellin ' what he will do .	You or my brother go after him .	if
4	91973	How could she continue to spew hate and venom about gays .	Her supreme court justice brother-in-law was one of them .	when
2	55107	We can all agree i was a jerk that night .	It 's you went out of your way to be an ass tonight .	but
4	147877	`` you are right , sweetheart , '' he murmured .	He pulled his hand away , seemingly satisfied with how he 's cleaned me up .	when
3	577	I 'd be heading three hours down the road .	My financial aid kicked in .	if
2	43738	I 'd traveled there on missions for don .	Maybe one day i 'd get to just visit niagara falls as a tourist and not kill anything .	but
2	53191	Josphine has been a wonderful host .	My personal tastes are for calmer and more intellectual pursuits .	but
2	150034	I can understand the device , brightness .	These books you 've given me on king gavilar 's death are more and more irrational in defending their points .	but
2	113107	Her times had been decent , only one or two tenths of a second slower than her personal bests .	She 'd felt exhausted afterward , like someone had filled her arms and legs with sand .	but
3	31412	Would she lose any chance she had with him .	She consented to being with another man .	if
0	31537	So i lifted the barrel of it for him .	Pressed it against my forehead .	and
3	122459	And , maybe he would try to steal the book from her .	He was the sort who would lie about his inside information .	if
0	12262	There was panic on the boy 's face , but i could n't . .	I wanted to tell him it 'll be okay-everything will be okay .	and
2	52505	Kizira grudgingly admitted , `` yes . '' .	I 've never been able to disregard a direct order .	but
3	43130	Would fight to the death .	One tried to take them from their dormitory .	if
4	55423	So , he was probably f**king high school girls . '' .	We were little kids .	when
0	120678	I tentatively bite into one .	It 's as good as our blackberries .	and
2	1593	Her mother looked happy .	Probably she thought they 'd be getting rid of justin once and for all .	but
0	113632	My feet are leaden reluctant to move .	I realize i should move closer so the fumes from the candle can work more quickly , but .	and
1	30242	I 'm just saying , be thinking about your menu choices . '' .	I do not want you losing control of the ardeur because you 've gone squeamish .	because
1	57658	The scouts of course were used to it .	Wherever they went , cosh wanted to get .	because
2	158520	I ask whats up and i press .	She hems and haws .	but
0	48029	He held his fingers to his lips .	Kissed them , as if praising the bouquet of my blood .	and
4	141831	He growled a low reminder at trish .	Mike opened his door .	when
4	64059	You know i was a little put off .	I first found out that you owned a strip club .	when
0	61230	They broke the connection at the same moment .	That she could only stare at her desk and be glad about the waterproof mascara .	and
2	158206	I was incapable of such things .	I knew that they would no longer serve any purpose .	but
2	148491	The two drunkards seemed a clownish duo .	Godric 's blood froze in his veins as he considered what might have happened if megs had encountered them .	but
3	139848	A dank basement is the ideal location to keep a kidnapped girl .	My grandfather is any indication .	if
2	55836	My dry eyes threatened to spill back over with my heart wrenching loss .	I made myself keep full composure .	but
2	72223	Our daughter , elizabeth , has been away visiting friends .	She will be arriving home within a day or two , and will be excited to make your acquaintance .	but
0	34146	Me go down in flames after my sister 's funeral , help me get on with my life .	Even less stayed around to put them out .	and
4	92954	The starter and battery seemed dead .	I tried to start it .	when
4	40191	Your mind connects absurdities .	You 're a little overworked .	when
0	90733	He stroked her cheek .	Kissed the top of her head .	and
0	56562	Majestatis is a very common sort of dragon ; . '' .	He is not on the council .	and
0	109017	You can agree to the demand .	Dislike the person because they assaulted your individuality or you can disagree and face the consequences which come with it .	and
4	10556	Tough-guy toothpick routine cracked .	He had to reach for a wall to steady himself .	when
2	153120	To have kept people .	Such prohibitions would not apply to the highprince 's heir .	but
4	25446	It was only half of the truth .	I said that i could never be your friend .	when
0	27770	His ermine-trimmed robe was very hot .	The crown was beginning to give him a headache .	and
2	93413	It began as a hobby .	Now , i think it could grow into something real .	but
0	131924	The commander rolled his shoulders .	Held his hands out away from his him .	and
2	158853	This was unheard of .	With so many transient workers , it was the norm in banff .	but
3	111014	It might even have restored her to sanity .	Things had turned out .	if
2	47724	Well , i shall wear the brilliants , then . '' .	Only to please you , a nighean .	but
2	12873	Ketin was a smaller city than tapal .	It had not been targeted by the xaosians .	but
3	127099	Ancient aracia is right on the verge of drifting off to sleep . '' .	There 's any truth to the legends of this land .	if
2	94906	It was true she 'd had a private benefactor prior to john .	One had been an oddity , and anne had been grateful to exchange him for the beauty and passion of her current lover .	but
0	48626	This was a fairy tale .	I was a princess .	and
0	41484	The referee sent luisa to a neutral corner .	Proceeded to check on the downed boxer .	and
0	147575	I could spend my whole life .	In fact , i was living a life now so superior to anything that i 'd ever lived before that i almost wanted to cry .	and
0	46943	Doyle 's sword tip pushed a little harder .	A drop of blood welled black in the moonlight .	and
2	43625	He remained silent about the trunk .	The police car backed out of the driveway , a black cat ran past , appearing and then disappearing through the beams of the headlights .	but
0	69933	Dripping from their noses .	Running down their faces and chests in little rivulets .	and
3	85785	But it was there .	A person studied the lined , handsome face , just as the minor limp was there in his left leg .	if
2	64202	I gave him a watery smile , and .	I think he understood .	but
0	117469	They left the t behind them .	Headed down the passage back towards the hole in the ceiling through which they entered .	and
0	46009	Miles recovered his wits .	Raised his revolver toward wax .	and
2	62465	Mikes heart still knew its place , and .	Never gave up its secret love .	but
0	53103	I slammed my foot into dawson 's , startling him into letting go , his curses following every one of my steps .	I broke free , racing up the side of the road .	and
4	22125	Paddington breathed a sigh of relief .	The sun finally rose .	when
2	144393	It 's only half a mile .	It 'll save twenty minutes on our time .	but
2	109755	Doc started to say something .	Doris warned him off by gently shaking her head no .	but
3	130326	Their investigation would begin and end with one question : `` was the inn directly threatened ? '' .	Sean went to them .	if
2	159464	`` i 'm supposed to be this uber-dominant of all the wereanimals , and .	I 've just finished failing the lions .	but
3	58561	It 'd be a miracle .	I survived the rest of the day .	if
0	137561	His chest tightened at the thought .	His eyes traveled over her body , not sure what he was looking for .	and
0	84968	Ethan undid the latch .	Tried to smile at the boy .	and
2	136049	His eyes are red and swollen .	His mouth is curled into a small smile .	but
4	57109	`` , i had this crazy reaction to him , like the kind of thing we read about - my body got overheated , i had goose bumps all over , my stomach clenched , you know .	I first met ash at the house last night .	when
4	149674	First of all , how do you collect negative energy .	By its very nature , it does not exist .	when
4	71243	He was going to go home and marry his childhood sweetheart .	He finished with his current job .	when
0	128648	Tek looked down at his wrist .	Then ripped the i.d .	and
0	14615	She put a hand on a hip .	Walked to the dressing room door .	and
0	125926	Burgey closed his eyes .	Cocked his head in a way that reminded prissi of people at a brahms concert .	and
4	68118	He and julia drove to the store to pick up the creamed corn and peas that hannah had forgotten the day before , having been preoccupied while she was shopping .	Thomas finally got around to waking up .	when
0	109818	She gave me a disgusted look .	Quickly opened the door , hopping out of her seat and going for the hood .	and
0	69768	I rub my legs with my gloved hands , sip at my water .	Wait for him to continue .	and
0	103290	She had a date .	Charlsie was keeping her grandbaby .	and
2	66889	Chapter five i told logan walking me to the door was more than .	He was adamant , gently guiding me to the main house .	but
1	92320	You suffocate to death .	There 's no oxygen in its gut .	because
0	151921	He looked back at me once in a while .	I could swear he was smiling .	and
0	132094	They would finish school , then come back home and go to the same college , maybe get an apartment .	Maybe take a year out to travel .	and
2	139091	Climb wasnt a sensual enough word .	My vocabulary failed to provide an appropriate synonym .	but
0	102314	Any werewolf who prefers feeding from the living is not very evolved .	They are often a problem .	and
2	68843	He broke her heart once , and he changed .	He had to grow up .	but
0	97849	Jim murmured something softly , something about love .	Then he left the room , closing the door behind him .	and
0	32292	Prepared to face the fact that she was in love with the worst piece of scum on earth .	Even thought about her ending up pregnant .	and
3	146350	I got up from the ground and looked seriously at her then said .	The idea comes from you then it will be a good one .	if
2	88317	He also had glucose tablets and protein bars .	He would save those for .	but
4	77368	Staring at me with his beady green eyes .	I see alex sitting in the front row .	when
4	36039	Exploding up a long hallway .	A door was opened .	when
0	154849	When they reached the tree line , ted killed the engine .	Coasted to a stop .	and
0	158720	I reached my hand .	Grabbed to examining it .	and
2	54630	Who she considered a friend going mad .	Didnt know what to do .	but
4	34848	They froze , and their eyes got wide for a second before they puffed up , accusing me of lying .	He walked up to them .	when
3	73033	Why the big panic .	That was an uninhabited system .	if
1	118200	I needed to hightail it back to the nevernever .	You and ice-boy were gon na need my help .	because
0	60774	The voice called out from below me .	Looking over my shoulder , i saw lights moving through the woods toward the base of the hill .	and
0	12507	Lately the other man seemed even more unsettled .	Berevus was not the most stable of persons to begin with .	and
2	55303	So twenty-four hours ago you could have cared less about how you treated me ? '' .	Then just like that , everything changed .	but
4	39356	Fat charlie nearly cheered .	The door was unlocked .	when
4	80250	I am aware that time is of the essence but it will take time to explain the severity of our plight .	She arrives please do not crowd her .	when
4	141038	But , he could outperform his fellow militia warriors by incredible lengths .	A vampire achieved wotb status .	when
0	49218	... '' he opened a desk drawer .	Took out a new week 's supply .	and
2	40363	Clint realized they had no intention of harpooning the animals were in hopes of beaching them .	They worked the herd nearer and nearer the shore , and .	but
3	44811	Then it had to be .	Brick thought it was a good idea .	if
0	122770	I put down my spoon , loaded with circular , fruity goodness waited .	Folded my hands on the table .	and
4	11490	`` mwwa ... '' `` and did you get that bit ? '' .	I killed that big six-armed dancin ' statue .	when
4	103557	Even think straight for that matter .	Shes the monster because she starts to think like an animal .	when
2	79892	I was going to wait outside .	It 's too cold .	but
3	16832	Aunt tatiana 's voice reminded me , in a rare moment of legitimate helpfulness .	Only they know she 's out .	if
0	48526	He passed through the double doors on the far side of the foyer .	Entered the reception hall .	and
2	54178	The tribunal said that there was nothing i could do that would change their minds .	They had hoped you would try to change mine .	but
2	11511	As george led him down to the first floor , the noises got louder .	They were still muffled-and his nose caught a whiff of concrete powder in the air .	but
3	118149	They were supposed to make the four disappear-not spill vrekener heads in front of all and sundry of the lore ! '' .	They were ever to reach skye hall .	if
3	109680	He will come , i am sure of it . '' .	I go in person to ask him .	if
2	27185	He 's still holding together at the library . '' .	I see sally looking worried these days .	but
0	85114	He eyed the doctor for a moment , settling her on the bed for the doctor to do her work .	Then let bella go .	and
2	136587	Chapter 27 on a ny subway , you get fined for spitting .	It 's free to throw up the next morning i was thankful the bed was occupied by the same amount of people i remembered being there when i fell .	but
2	36998	I didnt want to look back for fear that trevor , matt and lily would be standing on the sidewalk .	Also joined by emile and michael .	but
3	25679	I 'm paying , but to the fury of barbarians , do not leave me abandoned .	I 've offended you .	if
1	51766	You 're surprised you like it .	It almost seems like too much .	because
0	146779	There were no windows .	No day light came in .	and
0	68726	I had ever had .	He was probably the only guy who i would ever let nail me on something like that .	and
0	127246	The woman climbed reluctantly took and was pulled up .	Offered a hand meeka .	and
2	20281	The twins are only a couple of weeks older than he is .	They like to think they 're years .	but
2	10449	Man , did it feel good to be alive - and not just alive .	Having fought to stay alive and having won .	but
1	133096	Neither of the women looked his way .	They were both staring at josie who was still shouting .	because
0	41892	Anson watched the trail slither , drifting with the runoff , headed for .	Extend a fair way past the end of the trench .	and
3	133049	Maybe she 'd be able to find her power .	Elena ate and rested .	if
0	155419	My hand and i joined tuck .	Joey who were already viciously throwing the ball back and .	and
1	138029	Then samuel must have told him to floor it .	With a belch of black smoke the truck began to accelerate .	because
3	53576	It 's that design and manufacturing are all one process .	There 's anything that the last twenty years has shown us .	if
3	129163	As a matter of fact , you 'll have to act quickly . '' .	You want this little gem .	if
0	12951	Ill take this young man back on board .	Give him bedding for the night .	and
3	117172	She was on permanent vacuum duty at home .	She ever came home .	if
4	135378	`` dude , i earned a living .	Stan and i sold our feeble little company to some venture capital people for $ 10 billion .	when
0	48934	The compound had been mixed in the backroom of one of his anarchist brothers employers shop .	It had been presented to pascale with explicit instructions on how it was to be placed in this fashionable caf on the place vendome in pariss first arrondissement .	and
0	34455	Wisdom aside , the four were privy to information .	Experiences not revealed to the whole .	and
4	43409	I developed a big crush on you .	You first took me in .	when
3	100674	Though , i want to know what he says about it . '' .	He does recognize it .	if
3	76829	Svetlana was taken for a walk in a wheelchair .	The weather was good .	if
0	116813	Instead , she sat down on the floor next to her held her .	Put her arm around her shoulders .	and
4	90648	Broken the stillness of space .	Noah reached the tall structures .	when
0	99601	Moments later , the legionares at the front finished their gruesome task , leaving amara , bernard , and doroga the only people near the cave mouth .	Retreated to the back of the cave .	and
0	15837	The prophet looked at tarik .	Said , you seem to have a problem with the way beynor led his life .	and
1	29138	The ice giants was .	They were , well , giants .	because
2	125499	I wish i could not recall what happened .	I will choose now not to recount it .	but
0	148731	`` he did . '' .	They never saw us .	and
2	21815	She almost smiled her thanks then she remembered edda and glowered .	Their eyes met briefly as he set her gently on the ground , and .	but
2	90603	Id tried phoning every morning and afternoon .	She said i shouldnt , they didnt like it except in emergency cases .	but
2	91193	There were regular animals in it like rabbits , birds , and snakes .	Other things roamed in it .	but
0	23766	She pulled something out of her reticule and then briskly walked toward the side of the house where hunter was standing .	Dropped it onto the ground .	and
3	17671	You should know i 'm not a man that plays games .	You 've learned anything about me .	if
2	116457	The policeman , incensed by the insult , had turned his attention back to mohammed , pushing him lightly in the chest with his finger .	Retreating when the other young communist party members rallied around in defence .	but
3	98626	I had to think .	I could only figure out how .	if
4	64596	All three of the teenagers gasped .	They realized what they were seeing .	when
2	139608	It 's a surprise . '' .	Wear a swim suit-preferably the one you were wearing when we played volleyball the other day .	but
0	60961	Jonas saw the stubbornness in verity 's face .	Gave up the battle he knew he could not win .	and
2	148813	It was dark , his hair .	Used to be darker .	but
2	65435	Somewhere within him too , a voice was speaking , desperate to be heard , to be recalled .	Jack would not let it surface , his own determination to suppress this inner call frightening him .	but
0	59042	It 's a mess .	We 're a mess , and no wonder gabe wants to leave .	and
4	73963	To get back in the car .	The sheriff found us .	when
0	94750	Thou didst well when thou didst meet azash .	Doubtless will do well again in thy dispute with cyrgon .	and
0	11008	His rigid muscles coiled .	He drew in a sharp breath .	and
3	97869	They can call or email .	Anyone wants to reach me .	if
1	112558	The teacher sat her in the .	That was where the empty desk was .	because
1	82165	I had normally only dated other eternals .	It was just easier than trying to come up with one-hundred-and-one different excuses as to why i couldnt eat or drink anything .	because
2	64857	Given her persona , i expected something more addams family from her domicile .	She had peonies in the front yard , flower boxes , and a nice rock garden .	but
2	96181	What happened was terrible , and i doubt it would 've changed the outcome . '' .	There are a lot of things that could 've been done .	but
0	75693	She pushed aside the thin blanket then stood next to it , her hospital robe hanging from her shoulders .	Swung her legs out of the bed .	and
4	2060	Strangely , it is even more alluring .	It is a game in which skill is minimized , in which chance is the great equalizer , and i do not know why .	when
0	31468	She forced herself to just spit it out .	As she did , she realized how hard it was to ask anyone for help .	and
2	26240	Like all rumors , there werent any hard evidence .	Briksan was always unsettled by the mans eyes .	but
0	41454	A voice whispered to him , but tar would .	Told him to let go of his brothers betrayal .	and
0	43860	We 've a long journey .	Need to be rested on the morrow .	and
3	13382	That gun was going to be no good , but it still made me feel slightly better about my chances , knowing i had relatively easy access to a firearm .	I was going to be attacked at home .	if
4	97923	The husbands take me there . '' .	We 're in the city .	when
0	142375	He had his hands clasped in front of him .	His eyes were narrow and serious .	and
2	23679	Once we freed mckenzie , we carried her to a chair .	Since she was stiff , she started sliding off .	but
0	65460	The game on the dirt lot had come to an end .	The other kids had left .	and
0	5289	The doors of the throne room opened .	With a sigh , he stirred .	and
0	70694	He spread a gnarled hand .	Pointed to a piece of crumbling parapet .	and
0	72870	During the rain locker communication , there wasnt any time for elaboration .	Because she had replayed in her mind countless times seeing matt standing by a grave she hesitantly enquired for details , horsa was sent to help guswhy does gus need help .	and
0	12491	Wrapped themselves up in some quilts .	Kept watch at the window for marcia .	and
2	2276	The others were still up front in their seats .	She 'd retreated to the back as soon as they 'd taken off .	but
4	126869	I went for the high ground .	I woke up and saw the smoke .	when
0	118376	I grab my hatchet swing it into the side of his knee .	Let out a scream .	and
3	42532	I would be bloody grateful for any small wage .	It was the only way to feed my family .	if
3	108841	Then the white binder may well be hiding some of the most coveted clairvoyants in the citadel .	The pale dreamer is a dreamwalker .	if
2	103064	She loved her former boss to death .	Missy masterson , god bless her soul , had no idea what she 'd unleashed when she 'd asked her son to keep tabs on miranda .	but
2	36706	I 'd heard you were a cop from some of the other teachers . '' .	I had no idea you were a detective working with the mea .	but
3	82797	It doesnt deter me in the least .	Someone is homeless because he has a need for something that is stronger than his need for a home .	if
4	139927	Her hands coming around his shoulders .	She drew him close to her for a kiss to start the morning .	when
2	158261	He would be stronger and faster if he shifted .	Removing the bastard 's head would be easier with a sword than with his fangs , if not quite as satisfying .	but
4	123388	Sunlight was just cutting across the sky .	Kyle opened the door to the motel room .	when
4	22838	That coursed through her body .	She thought of gray .	when
2	144614	Gendry was always telling him to be more quiet .	It never did any good .	but
1	130859	I could tell and the guy who had been talking to liv disappeared .	John 's face went dark .	because
4	103114	But , i found , to my great surprise , that it was not savannah but don .	I opened the door .	when
0	116687	Apparently fit her better so she claimed them last year .	The same jeans that used to be mine , but .	and
3	112961	Andy would have told her .	She was seeing someone .	if
0	29143	Past people-all of whom yelped in shock at the large ( really large ) animal streaking by-bypassed cars .	Barreled past other animals .	and
0	158437	They waited a moment or two .	Still there were no dragon-noises , no sound at all in fact but bilbo 's distant voice .	and
3	23574	I did speak with those men who were by his side when he fell .	It is any consolation .	if
4	81177	Trace had flashed fang and claws , shifter-style .	They saw the bouncers .	when
2	20907	Lily tries to drag me off .	I stay my course .	but
0	27967	The trolls are up in the plaza .	The dwarfs are down in the square , and both of `` em are drinking up enough courage to have a good scrap .	and
0	877	Instead , he let it fall to the floor .	Strode toward me as swiftly and fiercely as his predatory alter ego .	and
0	10815	Just thought id check .	See how you are getting on .	and
3	62007	She thought later , blaise might eventually have started to listen .	She 'd kept on arguing the same points .	if
2	27954	The television was on in the family room .	There was no one watching it .	but
0	126425	Merlin retreated to his body .	Trotted out to where horst lay .	and
0	112746	Still his fury held for one more blow .	Before she could sink upon him , smothering him and all his little impudence of courage , he slashed the bright elven-blade across her with desperate strength .	and
0	49796	He heard her soft , exultant cry .	Felt her body grip him with fierce satisfaction .	and
3	152752	Then you must tell me who she is . '' .	I can come closer to that rock atop the farthest boulder over .	if
2	89836	Not to take power away from women .	To give it back to them .	but
4	12392	In his dream , she woke up .	He gave her the mommy kiss .	when
4	3826	His eyes light up .	He sees something in the display window of a mens shoe store .	when
2	56827	Sure nikki had been dealt a raw deal .	He needed to stop viewing her as a victim .	but
0	147457	I stared at jason .	He answered my question without me having to ask it .	and
3	100621	The least she could do was hear what had happened .	He could survive what had been done to him .	if
0	6349	He rebelled against me .	Tried to destroy my dream of leading the mystery alliance .	and
2	97785	She may have no use for the british empire , and she knows class when she sees it , and higgins is certainly that .	I have heard that she was a fiery patriot in her day .	but
3	51578	Such a thing had been lost .	It had ever existed at all .	if
2	65043	He tried to intervene . '' .	You were already gone .	but
2	16728	One sudden and desolating change had taken place .	A thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations , which , although they were done more tranquilly , might not be the less decisive .	but
2	22737	She did not have time to read the will .	The letter told her all she needed to know .	but
2	159442	The troop struck with his sword .	Thetra reached his bow out as a shield .	but
0	99325	Obviously , '' she muttered .	She tossed one to me .	and
1	114501	I havent told her .	I dont want her to get into trouble with me .	because
0	27439	D'artagnyn , who had her eyes fixed upon this woman , became very pale .	Let her glass fall .	and
0	105324	According to endelle , the upper ascender had rules he had to follow .	He was not permitted to slay lower ascenders .	and
2	68970	Anyone in your family knows what rider is guilty of .	People are dying because of it .	but
3	152694	Them understand the issues .	Even it took hectoring them all night .	if
2	32714	Garrett was married now , and the other two , ryan and matt , apparently kept the reputation alive by prowling the club scene and hooking up with warm , willing females .	Carson had been in a long-term relationship for a couple years .	but
2	140701	Channing had sustained only a few additional injuries .	Al were healing even as she watched .	but
0	50314	He reached into hydra 's body with a ghostly hand .	Grabbed on to her spirit .	and
0	108763	They cross your path .	Take advantage of your unique talents .	and
2	97723	It was intuition or merely past experience .	Whatever the reason , i was sure there was more behind his reasons for following this woman than what he was admitting .	but
0	35363	It has pleased the lord to show his servant dreams and visions .	That is all i can say .	and
0	22305	Gregor lost his grip on her fur .	The bat gave a heartbreaking cry .	and
0	17556	Sofia arced a brow .	Started on her way .	and
2	96175	That did not work .	Eventually she managed to lift mary high enough for her to come through the ceiling into the room above .	but
0	70213	I was so angry over you nearly dying .	The death of ouri was so angry that i lost myself .	and
3	134194	Then let us be off , my lovely . '' .	You have the goods .	if
0	112274	I just ground my teeth together answered lake 's question .	Got out my phone .	and
4	10621	Chris heard weapon fire behind him , followed by a rumble , then a puff of wind .	They had descended only a short distance .	when
4	91744	`` why are you going out .	Your first exam is on monday .	when
2	133029	Chrissy did not know what to make of the idea .	Accepted that she could not stay in the big city .	but
4	6736	I was more than delighted .	I felt him growing hard again against me .	when
3	159103	`` , i 'm out of there . '' .	She tries to cry on my shoulder .	if
2	157141	He would be nothing .	What he was with leah .	but
0	122754	My parents were dead . '' .	My brothers had been shipped off to different parts of the country .	and
2	90252	She might be little threat now as soon as she returned to the consilium she would be wearing a new vis bulla , and .	Would be back on the streets .	but
4	49683	I smelled the gas .	The hot water hit my hair .	when
2	98706	Lily 's feet were killing her in the four-inch spike heels , and she was afraid she 'd wrinkle the dress .	She wished she could sit .	but
2	37027	The gnomes had suffered because of it at least she was wiling to reconsider her choices .	She 'd been wrong , or .	but
1	68413	Brendan had more than the events of the afternoon to work .	He cried for some time .	because
3	90842	You 'll be trapped .	He 's anything like his brother .	if
0	64356	They think i 'm the father .	She had to list the father 's name for his registration .	and
3	98098	Was just handed to someone .	You showed any animosity or anger your oscar .	if
0	160800	Thats it , go ahead , older men and women who refused to join the attack would grumble .	Enjoy yourselves while you can .	and
0	130067	Georgie sat on the couch in flannel pajama pants and a ratty t-shirt .	Ate pancakes with her fingers .	and
1	127389	Who are really rich .	If you had a ton of money , why would you choose to live .	because
0	49529	The proposed straight road over the cemetery , which the city of manila is proposing to expropriate , does not lead to any commercial , industrial , or agricultural center .	If with said road it is endeavored to benefit some community or created interest , the same object may be obtained by the proposed deviation of the road by the defendants .	and
0	74963	Thinking of butch made anderson look at his watch .	Wonder when he would return .	and
0	51478	So i pushed open the nearest exit door .	Walked out into the coolness of the gathering evening .	and
3	55708	Hed probably be expelled for using bad language .	He were to say what he really thought of it .	if
2	86107	There was a jeter boy about two miles .	I 'd never seen him anywhere near the river .	but
1	70836	Nor had she seemed to ever quite master moving her jaw when she spoke .	All her words seemed to come through her gritted-though perfectly straight and blindingly white-teeth .	because
0	73723	Dante liked his position .	He was honored to be beta .	and
0	121273	There indeed lay thorin oakenshield , wounded with many wounds , and his rent armour .	Notched axe were cast upon the floor .	and
4	68562	Matts at the kitchen table with his head in his hands .	I come out of the hallway .	when
0	35623	Suddenly , something occurred to her .	She turned toward julian .	and
0	23758	The shaman sit before he spoke .	Regard them for several moments .	and
2	158271	She would play the game for .	He would never lay a single finger upon her or he would die trying .	but
0	90308	Tessa woke with a cry , her eyes flying open .	Found herself staring at shadows .	and
4	53647	Whatever remains , however improbable , must be the truth .	You have eliminated the impossible .	when
1	50849	I 'd only gone into blackburn 's lair .	Grandpa smedry had urged me on .	because
4	17944	He 'll just die .	He finds out you called and he was n't home. `` .	when
0	46355	The girl who had spoken to her was slightly built , even by ordinary standards .	Had gone to some pains to make herself look even thinner .	and
0	79371	Meredith compliantly sat down on the bed .	Waited while rob got her a glass of water .	and
2	82605	He was older , a bit stern .	He had just enough rough edges to his polished look to make her drool .	but
3	112166	Mr. jones i expect you to be the first person to finish next fridays race .	You want to lead this group of pilots .	if
4	65457	What our cricketers wear to protect those parts .	They go out to bat .	when
4	135775	He had that kind of energy and stamina .	He was only thirty-seven .	when
0	49878	She 'd felt something go down through the soles of the boots , down through the hills and through the years : ... how dare you invade my world , my land , my life .	Come back loud and roaring in a rage that shook the sky .	and
2	107841	The act of performing a sneak and peek on a citizen was technically illegal .	The agency did it all the time .	but
4	13047	Kester , on the other hand , moved toward her .	She walked out of the storage cupboard .	when
2	134699	Two waiters , setting tables , glanced at me .	Left me alone with my tears .	but
0	46211	He sniffed at me , disappearing from view .	Then ran toward the barn .	and
4	48087	How to deal with the two women .	The time came and they cornered him .	when
3	72485	You 'd know it .	I was really giving you a hard time .	if
2	79773	I am barely twenty-two .	I know what i want .	but
0	117721	I 've been thinking about it , '' she said , `` .	I think you should stay home with the kittens .	and
4	62368	The tilting of the boat was more severe compared to looking at it from a distance .	Standing on the ship .	when
0	64437	It was laundry day .	She was determined to do every job their mother had done for them .	and
2	98208	Jesse thanked him for that .	Was also slightly puzzled .	but
2	63858	All i heard was you asking me if i heard what buzzard said .	I couldnt hear him because the river was too loud .	but
0	139838	Justin had gone against my wishes .	Landed himself in trouble again-ugh .	and
0	83653	Now , hearing was my job .	Bethany 's life probably depended on it .	and
2	68787	That 's all sweet and shit , '' shane bit .	I 'm not done with you , cutter .	but
0	155695	Jack must know what we got by now ! '' .	He 's shitting a brick .	and
4	133020	All he has to do is wait for the captain to leave the office again and recover the card .	He 's waited long enough to be certain he 's gotten everything he needs .	when
3	141927	Then no one else will ever follow you .	You lose too many to battle or disease .	if
2	100582	Each step forward , away from their support , felt like walking into a void .	She pressed on anyway , until she was just a foot away from sam .	but
2	26246	Mr. beamer was alarmed to no end .	Did not lead on about it .	but
0	41850	Some slipped through their fingers .	Ended up in the fallen 's hands .	and
3	25996	I would be sorely tempted to invite you on board for a ... cold drink .	You could just promise to not bother me with this nonsense for a period .	if
2	79732	She was the enemy , clarissa thought .	The idea had a tentative quality about it .	but
4	124862	He tried to hold on tighter , but she slipped through his fingers and jumped to her feet , breathless .	She started to pull .	when
0	75651	An altogether clumsy series of sudden wind gusts manage to stabilize her soaring position .	With enough strain to force him to his knees , the elemental novice allows her a mere bruise-ensuring landing .	and
0	80300	Smiling at the memory , james said , well , it was summertime .	We planned a trip out to the coast .	and
3	160582	They would have seen only the tentacles .	Asked to describe him .	if
3	57416	To voice my concerns .	Even it was to nick .	if
2	158046	She had disconnected the anesthetic machine .	Left the hose running up to the wall , where plumbed pipes ran from here to the oxygen tanks in the mechanical room .	but
0	65753	Tired of evasiveness , daemon took the horse out of the yard .	Headed for the field .	and
0	113392	Jade jumped off the wagon .	Ran over to him .	and
2	128234	At first , it was just survival in the face of the intense sorrow .	Their lips opened , an unspoken hunger awoke .	but
0	77921	Why dont i take you to the police station .	You can explain it all to them .	and
0	85494	Her chin jutted out .	She folded her arms across her chest .	and
2	160060	I could see echo in the distance .	Every time i walked towards him , he seemed to fade further and further from me .	but
4	129287	There was another moment as jason .	He saw the vampire-thing 's red eyes bulge outward in disbelief as the tip of the pick plunged into the center of its deeply wrinkled forehead .	when
4	111354	Who interceded in the hallway .	Kayla was talking to you and i was the one who helped you when you were being followed yesterday .	when
4	80724	Ive done something similar with meeka .	She lost her money that is a more likely reason now that i think about it .	when
4	126357	And , her hair fell forward to sweep gently across his face .	She leaned forward to kiss him .	when
2	10474	Richard finished his ale and one of the patrons , a bearded merchant of some style , spotted him and demanded , and what does a nautical man think of these outrageous monetary restrictions .	Tried to leave without attracting attention .	but
1	55698	You do things on purpose .	You want to be the center of attention .	because
2	117679	She had known he was keeping things from her the moment they had met .	She couldnt guess what it was or could even be .	but
4	57161	I push my way through the crowd .	I hear my name .	when
0	78148	They struggled to their feet .	Keeping bent , limping like footsore soldiers , they shuffled back towards the rear of the line .	and
0	48525	Its members would never want to be outed as real monsters lurking under the facades of ruthless businessmen and women-but now tiffany knew who most of them were .	Had the pictures and dossiers to prove their connections .	and
2	159724	There are windows framing one side of the room through which the sea can be spotted .	With honours back to that wall i suppose it could look like an ordinary room .	but
3	157855	Your boot would be fine but your toes inside the boot could be crushed .	You kicked an iron breastplate .	if
0	125874	To stretch out his arm .	Connect natural fingers with spiritual fingers .	and
0	145621	Magrat 's hand stopped halfway to her face , in a little.cloud of powder .	Agnes saw her horrified look in the mirror .	and
3	90993	It was hed planned .	He did land on his feet these days .	if
4	55871	Only a moan came out .	He opened his mouth .	when
2	36428	I can use my contacts to find out everything the fbi knows and what theyre doing to find kelly , so we still get a lot of the benefit of working with them .	We can move outside the law if we need to .	but
2	103686	Ezio had not been able to get as close to francesco and the others as he had wished .	Kept them under close eye , calculating what he would have to do to reach them as soon as they started their attack .	but
2	83591	Why , kind sir , you honor me with your request . '' .	I 'm afraid that as there 's no music , i will definitely step on your toes without someone keeping time .	but
0	86674	She dragged a finger up his body , digging in slightly with her fingernail .	Took a long moment to look at him .	and
3	114954	Would you shove penelope and your unborn child into a burning volcano ? '' .	It meant saving the world .	if
0	123414	And so was i. i turned back to noah .	Focused my eyes on his .	and
4	22959	Used to know him .	You and finn lived underground with father .	when
2	7127	He had found the tiniest chink in jennsen 's armor .	Could not quite bring himself to exploit it .	but
2	126448	He gave the listeners fire and hope .	Left them with a touch of humor .	but
0	149131	Ygris waved his hand , the wet wood sizzling .	Fire sprang in an instant .	and
0	67775	He stood : `` why did you hide yourself , harry ? '' .	Asked maggie 's question .	and
0	87816	Terrified , i held my breath .	Huddled on the tile .	and
1	133215	That 's . '' .	Everything is closing in on her .	because
0	52972	The next day the chariots arrived .	The army was ready to go .	and
2	155395	She looked innocent and harmless .	Hart knew better than anyone how much looks could deceive .	but
2	62591	I would most certainly send everyone screaming for the exits .	I would do it .	but
0	60726	The younger will rule above father and brother .	His reign alone can provide his kind true sanctuary .	and
1	55585	I clench my legs for a moment .	Honest to god , i half expect a mutiny .	because
3	59586	Might want to do the same ! '' .	You 're hoping to not break your neck .	if
3	17023	His pricking out stick .	The actual re-enactment in reverse , for the benefit of the cameras , came anywhere near his new roses .	if
4	110602	He 'd run the soiree by his team , but he planned to make it .	They returned to the hotel .	when
0	50675	Bill paused , spat .	Peering down at the spot where it had landed , seemed to be contemplating the import of his own conjecture .	and
0	19546	Every morning , i left home stayed until late evening .	Drove the winding route to school .	and
4	43568	In pain after being beaten by a jealous , sadistic man , i wished that someone would come and take me away from him .	I was small and lying in my bed at night .	when
4	39079	To accomplish this , every doctor is expected to embrace the ice-cold logic of the necessarynothing less will do .	Put to the test .	when
4	108226	It was many years ago .	He was first spotted in one of the tree-filled areas along riverside .	when
0	41542	To show beneath the skin of his jaw .	Feel the expectancy in his breathing .	and
3	87	To break an ankle .	I chose to jump .	if
0	40006	It rattled unconcernedly down a side passage did a creditable impression of a trolley that had just been left there by someone .	Stopped when it saw or otherwise perceived the wizards .	and
3	11522	I could sell it .	I ever got tired of it .	if
4	29383	'' she offered instead , `` something happened . '' .	We touched in the fade .	when
0	32577	He spun sideways , just missing rufus 's claws .	Came back with an uppercut that snapped rufus 's head .	and
2	54509	Shane zigzagged , doing the best broken field running claire had seen outside of a football field , and he cut him off and bowled shane over .	Bishop was faster and more agile .	but
4	133195	I was a lot more comfortable with her but i still love her . ' .	She was just flute .	when
2	35438	I struggled to keep my voice steady .	The thought of how close charlotte was unnerved me .	but
3	31500	She might be able to outrun stranger .	It came to it .	if
0	29074	Esk walked along between trestle and simon .	Drank it all in .	and
2	51108	She twisted to get free .	He hurled her into the fireplace , propelling her headfirst so hard that the first layer of bricks turned to powder from the blow .	but
4	53315	How am i supposed to hold all that tattling against you ? '' .	You say things like that .	when
4	145776	She was busy dispatching the staff in every direction .	They returned and entered the throne room .	when
4	97047	There was deep affection in mari 's voice .	She spoke of violet .	when
3	93471	Im going this weekend to check it out .	You want to come .	if
4	40069	Storm 's glare slid from her to the clueless woman digging through her oversize purse .	Someone jostled her in passing .	when
2	6982	I started to turn around .	I was compelled to do a double-take when a bizarre sensation hit me .	but
2	110036	He 'd meant to cut it up for food .	They 'd caught him at it and run him off .	but
2	134358	He was still devastated that she didnt feel the same way for him .	He was grateful for having her .	but
2	120074	Elvis desperately clawed at the bank to escape .	All he was getting was handfuls of loose earth .	but
0	110638	The boy was never intimidated by authority .	Exhibited a devotion to equality and justice which he seemed willing to lay down his life to defend .	and
0	156217	Her cotton dress was hiked up across her upper thighs .	A hint of pink silky panties were peeking out from under its hem .	and
2	86234	My gaze darted to dee .	She was staring at the wall as if there was something amazing going on there .	but
4	47615	The challenge was set up years ago . '' .	The whole bottle system , the whole m-game , was worked out and set into motion .	when
0	47270	Sabrina tore her gaze from the fight .	Forced her feet to flee in the direction of home .	and
1	65536	I have asked you .	Theyve made it very personal and very personal it will become .	because
0	87323	He promised her long ago that he would never see or call her .	Painful though it was , he kept to that promise .	and
4	121199	Jerry peters photographed the body and collected a complete set of finger and palm prints .	Dr. jordan finished the autopsy .	when
0	38909	She looked up at him .	Wished she were younger , prettier .	and
0	9797	Before anyone could speak , the boat nearly ran .	The two natives turned back to their work .	and
0	106088	You have been resisting and .	Breaking the bond with the valefar boy .	and
4	13186	I convinced myself that the figure before me , was in fact ... me .	I saw the woman before me reach her hand out in the same manner , and her mouth drop open as i could feel mine mimicking .	when
3	138167	I am currently looking for a place .	So you know anyone who has a spare room to rent .	if
3	89393	I mean , he is with another girl .	You could call it a girl .	if
4	158892	He had brought this up .	We were parked , not when i was trying to navigate the outskirts of an unfamiliar town , bright with neon lights .	when
2	115319	I tried to say something .	When i saw him run his hands down his face and wipe his eyes it felt like someone kicked me in the stomach .	but
2	153135	They come to places like this trying to bring numbness to their numbness .	What they really need is a good sorting out .	but
2	144083	With disdain , my mother 's eyes scanned the dive bar ... trying .	It was nice to at least see her .	but
0	110686	After a minute more , she hissed out a breath .	Sat down , hair a tumbled mess around her face .	and
2	101153	She showed no signs of being startled as wade entered .	Rather laid her sewing on the table next to her , and stared at him as though he had interrupted a very important matter .	but
0	74217	Him to levitate himself out of the crowd .	Sail back to the peace of his apartment .	and
2	11421	He looked automatically for tessa .	She was nowhere to be seen-thank god .	but
0	37122	She had black hair .	Swirling blue eyes framed by long black lashes .	and
3	29109	He had no other choice .	He intended to stay the course he 'd set .	if
3	56495	Why did i get made .	It was just for this .	if
2	66144	At least i have one friend left .	I really need to find a way to make things with becks .	but
0	86551	Chuck leaned over at the base of the steps shook it out of the slot .	Grabbed a loose block .	and
0	39804	She 'd crossed over .	Seen the real horrors life had heaped on not just her .	and
0	121387	I closed my eyes .	Thought about the words .	and
3	11164	The memories were simply all that remained .	It werent for tarlston there would be no promise .	if
4	154875	Here late in the day , and they waited for buyers in the fluttering light on the boardwalk .	The dock masters got involved .	when
1	87920	The reason she couldnt see was .	Her eyes were closed .	because
2	55599	`` forgive me , lord ... '' `` you think i have no tender thoughts ' ! '' .	When you speak of love .	but
0	35158	Her lips were nearly touching his .	Curled into a smirk , `` you 're all smoke .	and
1	40948	To take regular pe .	Marching band counts as physical education .	because
4	114826	To start on carsons name , i noticed this gigantic rottweiler wandering down the sidewalk across the street .	I turned my focus back to the driveway .	when
0	98955	He simply sat in his chair .	Seemed to study mathen with acurious expression .	and
0	119236	His cuff links bore the insignia of westminster .	He smelt of the corridors of whitehall , brandy , cigar smoke and leather polish and spoke in a refined english accent .	and
4	152928	I could not help but to smile slightly up at him ; in the darkness of the morning , lit only by the still glowing torches that lined the path , he was , as always , simply the most attractive man i had ever seen .	He pulled away from me and put his hands on my face .	when
4	160652	You only do your therapy ? '' .	You have someone with you .	when
0	4958	Jen took the stone .	Grated it against the blade .	and
2	125011	Vidalia was peeling the wet blankets and sheets off the bed .	She stopped , and her head came up .	but
1	137994	He must have left before the final bell there was no sign of him .	By the time the student body poured out into the parking lot , making plans for tonight and the coming weekend .	because
0	85767	Then theodore had been put in charge of hell-o .	Had realised that he could use henry 's organisational skills around the place , as long as henry had his own office , and stayed there for most of the time .	and
0	152259	Why i should not rip your body to shreds .	Use the parts to decorate my dungeon .	and
4	39586	To drop into her chair .	She abruptly realized she was no longer in her tent .	when
2	77997	Things never progressed quickly enough during such operations .	He knew that his troops were performing well in the field , and barring something truly unexpected it would be a matter of time and attrition .	but
1	90640	I say weirdly enough , but this new suffering was in a class of its own .	We had suffered many things and still found the urge and energy to have sex .	because
0	9333	Leather-scented air puffed up around me .	I thought it smelled wrong without a little vampire incense in with it .	and
2	144677	Planting himself firmly , he pulled hard .	Still got no result .	but
0	40523	His consciousness seemed to shoot out of himself .	He found himself staring down at a man on a bicycle in the moonlight below .	and
2	73703	I wanted to ask what was going on .	I was barely strong enough to keep my eyes open .	but
2	14242	There was less power behind her swings and thrusts .	She kept the demon at bay while iain worked to kill the last two outside .	but
2	82934	It came out as two short barks .	I got the message .	but
1	34989	Shying away from spending money on non-essentials .	She might need it for living .	because
4	86282	Had smashed his heart into pulp .	The new e-mail message popped up , tick felt like an icy fist .	when
3	16536	I will have the legal department look into what it will cost to release you from the obligation .	You really can not work with callicott any longer .	if
2	156134	He had told her about his house over the course of their dates .	She had not seen it .	but
0	76799	I pushed up from the chair .	Walked across to the machine to grab a coffee .	and
2	113849	Her father had loved her .	Then he had never stood up for her , letting mother rule the roost .	but
2	48752	Lucian 's chain vibrated and .	Carried an edge of rage , something claire also recognized .	but
4	127630	They 'd both been free spirited , but something must have happened that night when they first hooked up .	It came to dating and sex .	when
1	52423	Wasnt going to ; but i knew it was time for all of us to move on as hard as that may be .	I was afraid it would be a sad night with everyone together again without jenn , roxy , and margy .	because
4	143320	You and lacey met .	She was in the house .	when
0	141028	His hands floated over my back to my neck .	Then worked their way underneath the silky soft fabric of my red robe .	and
2	146298	`` just about the only breed of bugs we saw were those little ones .	When we started back , torl caught a few glimpses of great big ones .	but
3	50	We can get you food .	It 's food you 're after .	if
4	123487	Just short of fifteen years from this day , the golden faerie leaves were still in the exact same state that they had fallen , in the same bowl , on the same unadorned stone altar .	Father brions inevitable replacement finally made his way into the sanctuary of the church of the wood .	when
2	127971	I shook my head .	Placed my hands on my stomach .	but
3	47601	Sir ... '' time had not been kind to braddock .	You 'd allow me to explain .	if
0	116243	Master red finished his show , are you okay .	Came down to talk to leeza before going .	and
2	100737	Jasper might be the closest thing she had to a brother , he might be scandalously liberal about love affairs and matters of the flesh .	When you came right down to it , he was a viscount .	but
0	68306	Yet cassie covered the hundred and fifty feet .	Was by devon 's side , in the mere blink of an eye .	and
0	56078	To widen that room .	Be ready to lock it tight .	and
4	35984	He gives me a little smile and wave .	He catches sight of me .	when
0	77025	Which had first diverged .	Then turned and rushed at each other down the endless corridors of time .	and
4	115363	Youve heard or seen .	You stay late at the museum .	when
2	92681	He stepped to it smartly enough and .	Coughed up a key in exchange for thirty dollars in cash .	but
2	151237	More the net of constraints would not only prevent ned from doing those things .	They would also grant him sufficient freedom of movement that they created ( for ned ) the impression that he could actually do any of those things while simultaneously frustrating whatever effort he might make at the critical moment .	but
4	85182	Being an event in our career trajectories .	We were downing car bombs and popping child rape drugs .	when
2	103489	Nadia dropped her gaze from his face , bashful .	Found herself staring at his hands .	but
3	151865	It may not come to pass .	It concerns a few , or one . '' .	if
2	122032	I 'd wondered if the detective would go through with the wedding .	Given the invitation , it looked like he intended to after all .	but
2	89917	Dried up before they exit their teen years .	This one is what , twenty , and still a virgin .	but
2	152749	Caleb responded a little awkwardly at .	Then he rested his chin atop my head .	but
3	138984	Tim up on the roof , dancing to some internal disco beat .	His moves were any indication .	if
4	70972	I was playing away with another man .	Really the only man i was interested in was him .	when
4	69758	Why should he have to hire someone else ? '' .	I can do it and i want to do it .	when
2	124235	Eddie would have to think about that .	Two rival factions trying to get the same territory were bound to clash .	but
2	121363	Her legs were tied to the chair , her arms behind her back .	The drugs were wearing off and it seemed she was bruised but more or less uninjured .	but
2	155484	She couldnt understand a single word the girl sang .	The melody echoed from the open door , soft and beautiful .	but
2	123521	`` and i can not blame you for it , either , '' riley said , `` .	It left me in an awkward position .	but
4	40440	He saw another side to tessa .	He heard her snap at her aunt rosha .	when

3	2337	She would be okay .	I could keep her in this protective vase .	if
1	84854	She had split up with her boyfriend .	He was too conceded .	because
4	125656	This was the moment .	He knew he should act like he was .	when
3	73486	I want to have ears in other places .	I am wrong about the syndicate .	if
2	10070	The bulbs lasted forever and the upfront installation costs were more than five times higher than banks of fluorescents .	Didnt use much electricity .	but
4	135246	That i was way out of the state .	I last pulled out cash .	when
0	10916	Feeling what she was feeling then that was gone .	Seeing what she was seeing .	and
2	75996	Froot loup looked at them , understandably a little confused .	Then just trotted off to her den in the woodshed .	but
0	65535	They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the road .	They still knew in which direction it lay .	and
3	13685	He 'd eat anything .	Tabitha allen made it .	if

2	61842	My mouth opened in surprise , not because tara had smacked my behind like i was a cow .	Somehow id zoned out , not realizing wed moved onto passing drills .	but
4	147399	We were all saddened .	The church found other duties for him .	when
3	111821	Tristan would still be alive .	I had never come home .	if
0	86937	Otto came about an hour .	Dropped off the clothes without so much as a grimace .	and
2	91972	Where we cant help .	Make a shitload of money .	but
2	118094	She realized that she had taken dustin and mr. smiths last name as her own .	That didnt bother her .	but
2	48917	If he killed his wife and stepson and faked his own death , he could take the money , escape punishment and . '' .	Evade his creditors without ever having to face the people he 'd hurt .	but
1	109637	And it actually hurt my heart .	I had been where he stood .	because
4	49809	I thrust my hips .	She did that special tug that only she knew how to do .	when

2	89834	Belinda knew he was trying to help .	She wished he would just stop .	but
3	56364	Odds are we would have run into trouble at some point in time .	Someone had been that determined to kill or capture me .	if
0	114672	My strength left me .	I could not stand .	and
0	4257	Jenny proved herself worthy of the title code-reader , given by a happy compatriot over at the amazon contact point .	She had two new birds in her flock of messengers .	and
2	56029	I had a few friends who were witches .	Amelia broadway , the only one i trusted , was in europe for a month .	but
3	115525	It would be much appreciated .	You would cooperate , mrs. bonny .	if
4	150	There for the old man .	He 'd needed hunter most .	when
0	112570	He stared fixedly at me .	Then turned and appeared to stare at the plant as though he 'd never seen it .	and
0	14720	Some would buy groceries .	Order a random meal before heading out into the woods to hike .	and
3	53604	Cool , and had a lot more money , she 'd dress just like you . '' .	My mom were ten years younger .	if
2	36655	It was though he were intoxicated .	He had been more intensely and violently ill than would be expected simply from drinking alcohol .	but
0	17140	One black foe was not his match one would not be missed .	He was jumped from behind , but .	and
4	42607	A wave of fear took me .	I realized it was the curse .	when
0	98725	As bryant hurried toward mubanga , he intended his short sword to mince off mubangas throat , where he launched it .	While it floated in the air , it elongated .	and
1	111104	* many cultures practise neither of these in the hustle and bustle of the modern world .	No one can remember what they are .	because

2	157176	14 steam was beginning to fill the bathroom .	Cheyenne let the shower run and stood in front of the mirror .	but
4	44878	She flinched and stepped behind me .	They began their approach .	when
2	69703	At the other end of the shaft is a room similar to this one .	It is a part of the ship .	but
3	86857	I 'd be pissed .	Too i 'd gotten saddled with that assignment .	if
0	137637	Returned to my arm then to my stomach .	The snake hissed its forked tongue at me in annoyance but .	and

2	78397	Before working at the bank she had been a keen swimmer .	She hadnt swum for the past several months .	but
3	135554	Then kylie would do it .	It helped the spirit pass on .	if
2	70216	Oh , i know .	I think we can come up with something better than that .	but
3	158745	I would not make so serious an accusation before the court . '' .	I did not have ample evidence to support it .	if
2	28894	She tried to shove him back out the door .	He took both her hands in his .	but
4	2052	Something really struck me as permanent and definite .	I told her thank you .	when
2	59978	Richard was repulsed by the memo .	Like watching a train wreck , he could not stop reading it .	but
1	141785	But he didnt mind .	He got to listen in on prime gossip that way .	because
1	125975	He gave a half-hearted snarl .	He knew that was what wolves did when they attacked each other .	because
2	147773	You think you have .	You 're still in a daze .	but
2	68531	She might sympathize with the king of were 's reluctance to strike a bargain with an out-and-out traitor .	Her only concern was being released so she could get to jagr .	but

3	35247	`` and , then i 'd have to kill you . '' .	I told you anything about me .	if
3	9615	We have little time .	We hope to make solace within ten hours .	if
0	4270	He glanced at himself in the mirror .	Adjusted the hat a few times .	and
2	105259	Well , not everything the sea and the air were still pretty much the same .	The buildings to our right , our left , and behind us were all suddenly dilapidated and in various states of disrepair .	but
2	111229	I saw him lurking in the shadows behind you outside the theatre one evening .	I have never met him and wouldnt recognize him .	but
2	119912	`` well , only a damn fool tries to run down a buck .	There am i , a damn fool , running after him , and there he is , standing in the lake , in oh , eight , nine inches of water , and he 's just looking at me .	but

0	129303	What she saw in his eyes was the reason she feared him , cared about him .	Trusted him to help her protect whatever she held .	and
2	119522	I went to look at my father many times that day .	Could see no change in him .	but
0	18614	Kosai stared at the old naked man holding the canvass .	The man stared back at him .	and
0	55598	But i have only one brother .	His soul is risen in my son .	and
0	90162	Branwein led walwain through a series of passages used only by the servants .	They came out by the stables .	and
4	139188	I was wondering , hauling us all off to the prison cells ; or for loren and john , being transferred to parts unknown , never to be seen .	The guards were going to enter or the red woman .	when
2	33726	The word snapped out from frank like a command .	Broke like a plea .	but
4	69003	I almost wept from relief .	Attorney beth osiecki waved her hand to catch my attention .	when
2	307	She waited for mabel 's expression to change .	It did n't . .	but
0	69235	Zen instructed dion to pull out of the parking lot onto the street , please .	Then told him to continue at a normal speed-no trying to get picked up by cops .	and

3	117488	You came to the post office .	You wanted any hope of anything delivered anywhere tomorrow .	if
0	50706	Then he 'd gotten an email from her .	The contents of it had broken the last shreds of resolve thomas had .	and
2	57056	She tried to greet him .	She suspected that her excitement came through because he reached down and kissed her hard when he walked up to her , standing next to his car .	but
4	155496	He looked at me , and he seemed like he wanted to tell me something .	Elder mahen opened his eyes .	when
2	95659	My timing was off and .	The sounds i made could hardly be called singing .	but
4	9901	I had a moment of sheer rage .	I thought the speaker was dryden .	when
2	98690	Which is a bit unnerving .	Otherwise they are much like men in their needs and their aptitudes to learn , love , and scheme .	but
2	25706	A little man is a little man .	Those little men who converse with the al-ferian and harbour darkness beneath their coat are smaller .	but
1	28940	There 's no donor .	I 'm half rit and half human .	because

0	13049	Ahnri stays away on purpose .	Ahmenos , looks on me now with such disappointment and shame .	and
0	6259	Bring the food in .	Lets get this show on the road .	and
2	60120	I know this will sound very strange to you .	I do not come from earth .	but
2	45200	When bill first got to the prison he was in good physical condition .	Was no match for the lifers and other hard core prisoners who spent as much time as possible on their prison bodies .	but
3	49463	What him say those things .	You were only hearing .	if
3	86239	`` now i 'll kill you . '' .	You ever call me again while i 'm getting head .	if
2	30921	About as exhausted as i felt .	If there was one force in this world that could drag him out of bed after a late night .	but
3	150691	I can get him .	You , uh ... wan na say hi , '' she said .	if
1	98369	She had no money .	They did her taxes .	because
1	59544	I was worried about what happened to him .	It was a really nice car and the likelihood of someone trying to steal it was as high as the junkie on the corner .	because
2	71341	The reliquary sat fifty feet from the mansion .	There was a long portico that jutted from the back of the house .	but
2	157383	I dont know what just happened .	I can see you are panicking .	but
0	2399	She fisted her hands .	Threw kinetic blasts at him .	and
0	82560	Puffs of blue smoke drifted slowly to the roof of the hut .	There was a brief crackle as the turf caught .	and
0	3511	A gesture and ians arms were yanked behind his back .	He was struck across the head before he could even stammer out a protest .	and
0	42449	A fight or something i could rip up the photographs .	Sell the pearls and coins on ebay .	and
2	59499	The lines of her ninety years showed on her face .	There was a sharpness in her dark eyes that explained ms. terwilliger 's unease .	but
2	133438	Then , as if alerted by some sort of signal , he looked up and .	His leonine eyes locked with hers .	but
0	140851	Alcee beck had many faults .	They were well-known , but it was just as well-known that he loved his wife .	and
3	131614	He would have had her pull erik out from beneath the wagon when he lifted it .	Aundy had two good hands to work with .	if
3	18549	`` they would have come already . '' .	Either of them cared .	if
0	71554	There was a humming in her ears .	The palms of her hands were damp with sweat .	and
1	117252	The research was very interesting .	There are people all over the world who have seen ufos or been up there with them .	because
2	105883	I was unhappily aware that i was thinking about the wedding strictly in terms of my own feelings .	There 's nothing more forlorn than being an old maid at a wedding .	but
1	129251	Some people never really experience it to this degree .	They never really try to open themselves up to their loved one .	because
0	117967	Now are all the women and children that had gathered there or been brought in by egalmoth stowed in the king 's halls .	The ranks of the houses made ready for the last .	and
0	120808	Screwing around with dark magic .	Instigating contact with the underworld just for shits and giggles-or worse .	and
0	160355	She stumbled over the woody roots of a fern .	Tumbled into the mud .	and
0	138207	You were young and you must get to your destinations as quickly as possible .	Your and vasos quests are very important .	and
2	46027	He examined every one of his actions , one by one .	He could find no fault of his own .	but
0	149894	They had dwindled now to some fifty men , by deaths in hardship or affrays .	They were become wary , and set scouts or a watch about them , whether moving or at rest .	and
4	139913	She 'd curled into a ball and wept .	She 'd received the news he 'd pulled .	when
0	95558	Anne hurried back to the sleeping cabin .	Crawled into her hammock .	and
0	140718	A day they ended a sixty-year relationship .	Tried to kill her might be the final stake to the heart .	and
4	76983	The blue boy leaned .	Sven raised the handkerchief .	when
0	103150	That house is watched , will , he said in a quieter voice .	It 's known that you have been .	and
4	20962	Chow was absolutely stupefied .	He took in all six feet of her .	when
2	74608	Calvin had always wanted to own a jag .	Never had the money .	but
2	108795	Surgery is long and thankfully i am able to quickly contain him so that the surgery can be completed .	Brian comes out of the anesthesia and changes twice more .	but
1	137617	They enjoyed the coolness while they could .	They knew that it would not be long before the sun burned its way through the clouds and fog to once again make the air uncomfortably warm .	because
4	47766	Who takes care of crimson and annon .	The rest of us are locked up .	when
4	128248	He 'd quickly turned away and concentrated on his glass .	Nate had occasionally looked to the bar entrance to see if cameron had returned .	when
0	40819	But mostly we 're over . '' .	Have been since you screwed michelle .	and
0	55267	Burying themselves in my torso .	Ripping through my flesh .	and
0	84880	It was dusk and there shortly we came to an ornate wrought iron gate .	There were just a few people .	and
3	72500	Maybe this skirt would n't have been appropriate if i i did n't . .	I worked at a bank .	if
2	63467	I saw a flash of images in her mind it could have been .	Pine trees , girls in the dark .	but
4	1795	It made him long for the old days , trying to solve this problem or that so they could download .	They huddled together in the basement looking at computer screens .	when
2	135847	I 'm not sure .	It seems to have something to do with the music box .	but
0	52141	That had been lizzie 's specialty .	Marley had never minded her sister 's popularity .	and
2	20598	And maybe it was the distraction of having jacob walking up behind me .	The last few steps were not as frightening as the first few .	but
4	28757	Run as fast as you can .	You hear my signal .	when
2	134708	The light was poor and if he stood up it would be much more difficult for her to hit him hard enough to knock him out .	She could hide the candlestick against her leg .	but
2	74897	Who own vast amounts of territory .	Would sooner die than farm it themselves .	but
2	29521	Only brick in front , the other walls had yellowed .	Most of that was hidden by four or five massive trees in the front yard .	but
0	121679	The old man had caught his breath he reached into his vest pocket .	Took out an old skeleton key .	and
3	19268	She slaps me right across the face .	I 'm not good .	if
2	51937	It had once been painted with the white letters of a company name .	It was no longer possible to discern what this name had been .	but
4	88157	He said softly , i love you , rosa-lee almaida .	He lifted his head .	when
2	51837	I knew that he was going to go back on status .	I never knew for sure whose decision it was .	but
3	4095	Why i am asking .	She is seeing anybody .	if
0	27887	The men were huffin puffin as like theyd been in quite a rumpus .	Didn see ny fightin neither , but .	and
0	141529	He told her to grab her bag and her half-calf .	They 'd take their show outside to the tables on the sidewalk , where a smoker could still feel some love .	and
2	95076	She recognized cleavers handwriting .	Was confused by the contents .	but
1	160357	When the demon died .	Nothing had taken root .	because
0	44131	Erin pressed one of the bags into kotas arms .	Said , ill come back next week , okay .	and
0	51639	We will treat this sovereignty like a city-state .	Will begin mining for the benefit of our two civilizations .	and
4	113747	I was sure i could see a keyhole-shaped dip .	I looked really hard .	when
3	140876	He 'd gently correct her but until then , he 'd let her explore without any fear or self-consciousness .	It was an issue .	if
3	67095	`` i got you , babe '' all around him , he was out of .	A flash mob of cher impersonators broke .	if
2	73430	Elizabeth was trying to compose a speech of apology .	What could she say .	but
0	53284	To strike directly across tamul .	To lay siege to matherion itself .	and
2	139414	Jez had never felt anything like this before .	She knew instinctively that it was dangerous .	but
4	24035	Then , invite the scorpions to a celebratory slap-up meal and eat them .	The snakes were beaten .	when
2	39578	Evans said , `` ? '' .	What 's all this about a garage in sonoma .	but
2	90513	The sentries glanced at them .	Did not stop them .	but
0	11868	That was clearly not the main point kor found the erotic parts restrained and tasteful .	At times the dance took on an erotic turn , but .	and
0	16938	She was a strong elemental in her own right .	She 'd had more than enough power to take out pete with that one blast .	and
3	77243	You too will learn to make and work these machines and others .	You put the effort in and learn as much as you can .	if
0	130049	He saw a marriott room key in her hand , maybe convert him to barnett 's cause .	Figured she was heading to the hotel to give some reporter a blow job straight from god .	and
2	37716	I didnt want to hurt angharads feelings , or it still vexed me .	See her question my sincerity .	but
0	127621	She slipped into her other sight .	Studied the ultralight wavelengths seeping out of the crate .	and
0	142910	Wrapping her legs around his waist , she closed her eyes .	Surrendered to his touch , every fiber of her being consumed with need as he kissed her again and yet again , his hands caressing her , arousing her past all thought or reason .	and
2	91892	In russia , the christmas eve feast was called holy supper .	To viktor , it felt more like the last supper .	but
3	37844	Ill find a way into hell and dont say that .	That bastard harmed you .	if
4	141398	It had been far before her time .	The last nephilim had breached their contract .	when
2	157727	Then he merely eased her into bed and .	Pulled the covers up over her as her head settled onto the pillow .	but
3	127982	I just wanted to thank you .	I dont make it .	if
3	129043	Then i 'd know he wanted more time with her .	He immediately introduced us .	if
4	146161	She gets very restless .	She does not walk .	when
4	69760	It therefore surprised everyone .	She returned in less than a minute with a wild expression on her face .	when
1	148751	Jamie and i start talking about chemistry and physics , a class i took last year as an elective .	I was interested , when hilary walks , eh , more like crawls , through the front door .	because
0	116881	I 'd never modeled , never looked like much of anything next to the genetically blessed socialites that attended my preparatory school back home .	Never had guys drooling over me .	and
0	46948	She adjusted her torn and filthy tunic with her free hand .	Held in her sigh .	and
2	96456	I 'd hung the picture for him when he came to stay with us .	After a few years , we redecorated his room and he stuck it in his closet .	but
4	4763	Gods , '' she muttered .	White van pulled out moments .	when
4	123284	Rafe stepped out of the shadows .	Cagin and susie arrived .	when
3	145399	`` sorry '' he said as he filled their glasses .	It 's a bit warm .	if
0	97005	He found a cracked bowl lying beside him on the floor .	Waited for the soup to warm .	and
2	97182	Hed heard a little bit from henry yesterday .	He was dying to hear the entire story .	but
0	106035	She pushed herself away from the window .	Went in search of the hostel owner .	and
0	116129	Then she 'll turn cold . '' .	Will feed from anyone who 's capable of sustaining her .	and
3	31930	... , if there was anything she could say or do to bring forward any help .	She 'd had a way to do anything to improve this sad occasion .	if
3	49665	And , he shrugged , you go home tomorrow , cod .	You dont make the grade .	if
3	3187	To flush a meatloaf down the toilet .	You put it that way .	if
4	17011	We need to get .	Thou finishes thy meal .	when
0	41314	As they came through yet more doors at the further end , a sound of water fell upon their ears .	The grey light grew suddenly more full .	and
0	43484	He went to his safe .	Withdrew several documents to sign over limited power of attorney to his second-in-command .	and
2	26092	Riam 's mouth thinned with uncertainty .	He finally gave a curt nod and walked from the room , warning them he would be just outside the door .	but
2	57934	The vampire was sent by lavinia .	Birch worked for the caste .	but
1	117865	I would want out of my marriage from one sister .	I had lost my soul completely to the other one .	because
2	42401	Mom says the burglar stole all the expensive frames .	She had the negatives for the family portraits and had them replaced .	but
0	50625	We 'll live longer .	Keep their meat fresh .	and
4	113376	She had managed one , though at the time she had believed it merely the result of her familiarity with the local furies .	She had needed a flood to save tavi 's life .	when
2	127704	So you 're doing nothing . '' .	Hurting your own , man .	but
4	127352	He was about to open the bank door by himself .	It was flung open by a wigged footman who shot a frightened look at richard and moved to one side .	when
2	38811	The detectives back then thought that maybe she 'd run away . '' .	Her family never bought that story .	but
3	64445	She 'd do anything he said .	He was getting her out of .	if
4	98539	It 'd seemed weird to experiment with crazy new sexual positions .	The old standbys worked .	when
3	19364	Something terrible could happen .	You leave these children out here by themselves .	if
0	33418	He took her to zarachs old room , that richly appointed little fortress that was bereft of windows .	Had too many locks for an interior door .	and
2	142427	She was all an expert on what the man smelled like .	Normally did , and .	but
0	63327	I was a big strong girl .	... well , you can see the picture .	and
2	97958	Anita killed her to save all of us .	It was you that took control of the city and made everything work better than it had ever worked .	but
0	151627	She forced herself to smile .	Walked back to josh .	and
0	128129	But instead , the bathroom door opened .	Molly appeared in a swirl of steam .	and
4	90944	He caught him with his dinner .	He rang up his college friend and philosopher .	when
0	9270	For the war had gone ill with the sons of feanor , though with great cost to the hosts of morgoth ; and celegorm and curufin being defeated fled south and west by the marches of doriath , and coming at last to nargothrond sought harbour with finrod felagund .	Well nigh all the east marches were taken by assault the pass of aglon was forced .	and
2	78338	He had half considered getting his brother-in-law to assist .	Figured it would be easier to do it without mark turning it into another excuse to hit the booze .	but
2	124008	Steven held the rim of his dress in a hand , and .	Chased the dwarf , only that grimdin passed through the gate and disappeared .	but
0	89109	He put them down inside the door of one of the rooms .	Opened the door across the hall .	and
2	9024	Lindstrom 's nostrils flared as if she had a quick retort on the tip of her tongue .	Van dormer held up his hands .	but
2	60467	She did the same for the fourth target .	Aimed for the opposite side of the bull's-eye . .	but
3	57686	Dismissing it as a lesson for eleanor 's future reference-even .	The lesson he had learnt had been not to kiss her .	if
2	4956	Perhaps this connection was our secret .	There was no way of telling or of knowing for certain what was the case .	but
0	121631	Eventually , bethan stood up .	Went to wash the dishes .	and
0	151615	Its normally plentiful diet of aphids , midges and other small insects had become strangely scarce .	It was reduced to pirating whatever meagre supplies it could find .	and
4	150973	Miles had returned six weeks .	The story was well and truly dead .	when
2	71298	Robin 's eyes drifted shut .	That was the only response she made .	but
3	7123	He never would have agreed to it .	He 'd realized how much trouble this damn party would be for her .	if
1	117735	I need to be able to contact them .	My parents are quite old .	because
0	88904	Violence hung in the air .	With a nervous motion , abby was out of the chair .	and
2	18020	James tried to break free .	The vamp was too strong .	but
3	114548	My dearest sarah i am .	You are reading this .	if
3	89448	I 'd cut off your balls and make good use of them .	I were a lesser woman .	if
4	103655	He went to the haven of the swans and began to man the ships that were anchored there and to take them away by force .	He judged that his strength was .	when
3	65776	Maybe my chat with mrs. smith made an impact .	She and her husband were the culprits , perhaps theyd stop decorating now they knew of my involvement .	if
0	86417	Toni stepped closer to bob , but i dont remember who the author was , however i think he lived in another country and hit the best seller list here in the states .	Said , im sure its still at my parents house in my old room .	and
0	31646	He tore his eyes from the screen .	Continued searching the apartment .	and
3	129742	I asked . '' .	You planned to marry synda and you refused to answer .	if
4	147066	It was definitely open and there were definitely people of both variety in .	We pulled up to the building .	when
2	151798	Ellie was far from impressed and .	Felt distressed that the man should be experiencing such discomfort on her account .	but
4	98829	The stray quickly and quietly disappeared , just as if he understood .	Mr. nicholson stepped into the yard .	when
2	10087	Normally , i would be embarrassed .	I was just so happy to see him .	but
0	138794	Listen , adelina , you 're almost completely asleep ? '' .	I need you to open the chest with me before you are , okay .	and
0	115604	To pluck out of thin air .	It made regan nervous.kicking back the covers , regan stood up .	and
0	144815	His sister was dead .	He needed some time to cope with it in his own way .	and
0	89941	But then i came upon the spot where he fell .	There were tracks in the dirt .	and
2	122251	I am curious about human pleasures and .	What they feel like .	but
2	44064	She could not see their faces .	She heard their voices chanting .	but
2	112439	Birds chattered in the trees .	Otherwise , the park was quiet .	but
4	145600	Then unable to shake the sensation of being cornered .	Such a position begins to creep him out .	when
3	21183	Perhaps he could again wander through her unconscious mind .	They could not be together in the flesh .	if
2	13836	A pair of dogs had started barking farther down , i guessed a house or two .	It sounded like the other side of the street and i didnt let it bother me .	but
0	8973	You could all use the rest .	You all have a lot to think .	and
4	56036	The imp defended her , not littlefinger .	Joff had her beaten .	when
0	64238	This time , he grabbed my ankle .	Toppled me to the ground .	and
0	63003	But it was uncomfortable to think woolvey had brought it .	Laurence was painfully aware , he had .	and
0	90144	Then she focused on me with her eyes .	It was impossible to look .	and
4	111564	Joff startled , but he relaxed as coursa began to massage away the tension .	He felt hands on his shoulders .	when
1	26888	And , he 'd spent some time with other warlord princes who had been friends in the rogue camps .	Her absence meant he was free to travel to other towns .	because
2	8883	He just turned 2 .	He says hes a big boy .	but
0	123112	In an agonizingly slow manner , the captain held the tray out toward the guest .	Patrick saw the man 's hand lower to retrieve the absinthe glass from the tray .	and
0	25611	I went into the kitchen to get some plates , napkins , and silverware .	When i came out she had everything out and was already eating the lo mein .	and
4	44405	Mr. hammond , i have met none of the inca aboard , '' mrs. pemberton said .	She was permitted to visit them .	when
4	114764	The last tecuhltli except tascela had fallen .	The princess reached the cimmerian and the girl who had taken refuge beside him .	when
2	9088	It would take a lot more conversations between rafe and maggie .	At least today was a start .	but
2	113679	This , i might have doubted him .	I could not doubt doyle .	but
0	149644	That her rings were .	In fact she was wearing them .	and
2	72177	They both smiled when i passed by .	Waited for me to finish up before greeting me .	but
4	54642	She 'd had to pull caillen back on more than one occasion .	Her brother was going to head out and kill the man .	when
2	5463	He was raving about the epidemic spreading .	I attributed it to his depression .	but
0	46680	Instead of carrying blood , it held multiple scrolls what might have been some sort of flute carved from bone .	Had never seen - but .	and
3	66246	He might give up the stag 's pursuit .	He thought it was nothing but a peasant tale .	if
4	33725	Only got two steps towards the table .	She felt her mother rap her hard on her rear with the spoon .	when
4	73325	In the past there was an old and powerful race called the ancients .	Humans were actually not much more than mindless beasts .	when
2	22418	Her grimace let him know she resented his demands .	She left the door open and rolled into the kitchen .	but
3	61994	`` milaya , we will have words . '' .	You do not stop .	if
0	1477	The witch is said to put the evil eye on their victim .	The victim dies because they believe they will , nexus leaned forward in order to emphasize his words , it is not because the witch has done anything to them , physically , but in the mind of the victim they believe something has been done .	and
3	11613	We can start weaving through these cones .	You can remember what i showed you .	if
4	79609	`` we have time , '' i told him .	I had no idea if we did or .	when
4	96571	But , perhaps twenty feet from the maple , he stopped and lay for a while , massaging his knees and loosening his wrists for the last lap .	He was close enough for the tree-line to hide him from the house .	when
4	106579	To get his food ready .	Especially it takes me .	when
2	155603	`` i do not say he is not clever , in his own way , '' temeraire had said , `` .	I am very sorry to say , laurence , that he is not to be relied upon .	but
2	15139	He is older , close to forty .	You 'd never think it by looking at him .	but
0	51412	Lost its look of confidence .	Began to exhibit worry .	and
0	1646	He grabbed the nearest table , and gisbourne grabbed my arm , pulling me out of the way .	Threw it toward me .	and
2	96684	She would go , she allowed , for the sake of peace .	Hizdahr zo loraq was better suited to treat with the wise masters .	but
3	78785	In fact i 'd probably deny it .	He confronted me about it .	if
2	100407	He still had a few credits before he could officially take the bar exam .	He could look into taking italys equivalent and start his own practice .	but
3	42691	Which would be a winner .	Only the rams scored a touchdown .	if
3	32391	Going to be skin and bones .	I dont make money .	if
2	117311	The priest had absolved him of his sins .	Also advised him that all men had an obligation to love their fellow man .	but
0	114525	Kinich , who 'd been helped up by two soldiers , pulled .	Crouched in front of chaam .	and
2	65659	It had necessitated an extensive search of the attics all this morning , accompanied by much sneezing and filth , and she 'd found the book .	She 'd had to take a hot bath .	but
0	69431	They were too casual , too messy .	I resented that , but man , he never once considered beheading me .	and
0	148680	It involves a commodity . ' .	We all know how expensive commodity transactions can be .	and
4	112426	Chapter 19 micha , ella 's not at the house .	I return home from tux shopping , without a tux , apparently there 's nowhere around star grove that has them .	when
2	94692	She willed the girls heart to start .	The steady high-pitched whine of the monitor only mocked her efforts .	but
0	31069	By the time they reached the camp , the men were laughing .	Toasting the fallen with words .	and
0	58975	That put him off .	Now looking at her helpless body .	and
2	10280	I 've never opened it .	I know it sits on these shelves in our time .	but
2	17396	I want to ask about it , so i decide to not mention it-at least .	Then i remember how jenna said talking about her mother is the equivalent of placing her in a dark hole .	but
4	149764	He had fallen in love with her image in her photographs .	One reviews his comments to the council and to other members it becomes obvious that stuart had fallen in love with stella mayfair he had fallen in love with her under the very worst circumstances that is .	when
4	6169	`` well , that 's not all that unusual .	You consider roy burdett .	when
4	73668	He 'd nod his head and walk out the door .	She 'd see him at cuppa cafe .	when
2	56227	Air is your friend his voice snapped her out of the daze she was in .	Her heart was still pounding in her chest as she struggled with tanners request for her to breathe .	but
2	145459	It had felt ill-timed given their situation .	Now at least she felt she knew him a little better .	but
4	49574	The rest of us were jealous .	Chris started bringing you .	when
2	135594	He wound up falling backward into chad 's arms , and .	Three paramedics guided him onto a stretcher .	but
3	997	It 'll turn into pneumonia .	I 'm not around to make sure she rests and takes care of herself .	if
2	95381	I know how hard it must have been to have me in her house .	She dealt with it so she could find out what i knew .	but
3	147644	This would be it .	There was ever a time for a lady to curse .	if
2	114564	The mans eyes seemed to widen .	It was difficult to tell because of the small figure .	but
1	43356	Being shot six times .	Not the stranger was still standing , but because of what was happening to him .	because
4	47413	Watching for the day .	The lord ruler was gone .	when
3	51507	Then we will be able to easily rule these people . '' .	We improve the savage 's life and give them cures for the diseases .	if
3	3607	But , what would happen .	He let the beast out .	if
2	37197	I find myself concerned over his well being .	I quickly dismiss such thoughts .	but
2	139279	Mylovic was a shirker who lived in smoke-and-powder land half the time .	He was also a true friend , and he knew more of unearthly matters than zok ever would .	but
2	85010	Someone had holed up here for a while and no body .	There was blood on the floor .	but
3	13842	I can do more . ' .	It is thy wish .	if
1	44054	She noticed the small car on the side street .	Only people were standing next to it .	because
2	29536	I felt guilty about messing with his memories and holding him and jess hostage .	In the end , things worked out for the two of them .	but
3	49215	We were just wondering .	We could check those bites on your neck .	if
0	89524	Molly appeared from the living room a moment .	Said , `` harry .	and
0	108517	He fitted his body to the curve of hers .	With his arm around her waist , he hauled her deeper into his still agitated frame .	and
0	124514	It was hard to know what the little goblin noticed what he did n't . .	Kitto might have been oblivious , but .	and
3	138801	He would not burn to ash before this holy sanguinist .	His path was righteous .	if
0	59115	Celaena plopped into the giant armchair behind the desk .	Set about opening the pirate 's ledgers and turning over his papers .	and
3	141444	Anyone to overlook him .	Even he only got fourth-line minutes .	if
0	91242	David and lance go over to the balcony .	Look down towards jay .	and
0	155384	Her palm flattened over the shield around me .	Suddenly , the waters from the sprinklers fell hard on me , soaking me through .	and
0	72623	To wash my face and arms .	Anywhere else i can reach .	and
0	33478	He held the man gently by the throat .	Absorbed his native tongue .	and
2	18394	Buildings were burning and occasionally spazzo 's smile never wavered .	Gunshots could be heard .	but
2	137417	Fine , ill go .	Know this prince nabarun i will be watching you .	but
2	159244	I understand he was very brave and noble and whatever .	He left me here , and i 'm not sure it was worth it .	but
2	45592	A sob rose in her throat .	She quickly swal owed it down .	but
0	97251	If she saw them watching , all her courage would desert her , she knew , and then they would have her .	She would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby .	and
0	149629	Only now the dream was .	The santa of her dream was gone and she was yawning and trying to open her eyes .	and
0	66191	He 'll appear . '' .	We 'll have a split second to act .	and
2	69596	The winds still swirled around him .	The power ebbed from him .	but
4	65986	I was not present , whether in hebrew or in greek .	These words were finally set down .	when
4	139867	I thought beth - dropping off a book - might pass out .	Seth passed by at one point to tell me he had to run errands but would see me .	when
0	50112	While krage sat projecting his warning , tironock pinpointed his location .	Directed the white goblins to seize him .	and
0	152519	To see it on the news at noon .	Tell him when they got back to campus .	and
2	87878	I was skeptical about her plan .	Considered doing what was needed to resign from being some hired hitman .	but
4	31686	Oh habibi you know a thing or two .	You get to be my age .	when
3	141453	And clen could easily guess maxines response .	She started a debate about that .	if
2	160324	She smacked him in the arm .	Before she could speak or explain , he spoke .	but
2	33037	The guard , meanwhile , moved away from the front door .	He kept his gun aimed at us while we left .	but
4	79710	I was immensely relieved the rest of the morning had passed .	Lunch break came two classes .	when
1	105469	`` i mean does that mean there 's something wrong with me ? '' .	I stopped hating him .	because
0	17201	To pull herself to the floor .	Scramble off to the hallway .	and
3	67021	This might be a clue to when the ancient ruins had been constructed .	Gabriel 's calculations were correct .	if
0	86466	I 'd gone through the caves and the portal .	Followed a lizard-dragon-worm through the earth .	and
2	70188	She knew she was far over her budget .	She could not seem to stop herself .	but
0	54573	Living comes along , with her beating heart and seriously breakable everything .	Suddenly it 's all , `` oh , violet , can i sleep with you .	and
2	2961	I think he should have been prescribed doggy xanax .	Who am i to say anything .	but
0	113838	Samantha smiled up at her .	Reached out to warm her hands in the gentle flow of air .	and
0	56917	It held a bow .	Was launching arrow after arrow down at the dog .	and
3	49104	When you arrived without tariq , where has shuloch gone .	Even they 'd welcome you .	if
3	126969	I 'll do it .	That 's what it takes .	if
0	100364	We 've got to get the orb back from ctuchik , now . '' .	I 've been meaning to have a rather pointed discussion with the magician of the murgos for a long , long time .	and
3	128634	I need to address it .	Anything is wrong on the outside .	if
0	13102	Opening his own mouth .	Drawing her tongue inside .	and
2	61013	Count asmus was never quiet .	It was as if he left a trail of calm behind him as he went .	but
0	141269	I was buzzed into the building .	I took the elevator up .	and
4	103789	It is worse than silent .	He stops the car .	when
4	64374	I kicked the gun under the couch .	It fell from the guard 's hand .	when
3	94508	They would report it back to heck cherry , and it was anyone 's guess what that junked up lunatic might do .	He tried to contact them .	if
2	76	It was a block and a half .	I had to get .	but
0	13385	Ingratiate yourself bring yourself finally to the strategos ' attention . '' .	Rise through the ranks .	and
3	37198	Then i wanted it .	He wanted me to climax .	if
2	150204	He was the eldest in the family and in his haste he had forgotten it atop the rock .	He alone possessed the cortuc that could have saved them from the vicious attack .	but
2	93079	It was secondhand from aidan , or even max .	Inevitably , when he walked outside , he came back smelling like tobacco .	but
2	8485	They were pretty garish .	At least they took the attention away from her deformities .	but
2	37808	Even he is truly still alive we pray to our shared lord , peace be upon him , that marwan is well and bearing his captivity with grace and dignity .	We do not know where our beloved son is , nor .	but
4	20094	Ramiel jerked his head towards madeline .	A rush of medics entered the room .	when
0	128799	A cease-fire had been declared .	Everyone was abiding by it .	and
0	37590	I also had to appease grimly unhappy officials .	Discovered i was now a guest of the bellagio hotel , courtesy of scaring the crap out of them by dropping dead in their conservatory .	and
0	65034	Word of our abduction got .	They put together a team to rescue us .	and
3	89060	Clearly , the dark hadou has had no effect on you .	You are able to retain such intense focus while fending off sakura .	if
2	154340	It might be rather warm later this afternoon .	I imagine it should be nice this morning .	but
2	42074	Yelping , i tried to back .	Slid in the soap .	but
4	77959	Maybe you fall and hit your head .	You get out of the tub .	when
4	106018	She knew he would not follow her .	St. john made no effort to continue their conversation .	when
1	119640	Most of the fields have gone now , but they still keep a few animals on a small patch of land .	They were unprofitable , which is why gwyn and huw must work at a nearby quarry .	because
3	144843	But even if you were the most elegant and refined being on the planet , i would push you .	Even you were golden .	if
2	22417	He understood completely the need to be with her sister after such a trauma , and fear was an ugly , clawing thing that kept him on edge .	He tried hard to suppress the selfish part of his nature .	but
4	97262	I knew he 'd ended the call , and i was flooded with emotion as ben surged forward , filling my mouth .	Both of his hands cupped my jawline .	when
1	61524	My guardian angel would change his garb .	I 'd changed mine .	because
0	101032	Max dropped his gym bag onto the floor .	Shook faye 's hand in a way that made it obvious he was used to girls fawning over him .	and
3	151861	It should definitely be thomas .	You 're going to be scared of any of my brothers .	if
0	15669	The elder malachai was holding him .	It was his father 's hand he felt stroking his face .	and
2	147392	She clutched for it .	He stepped back so far that she almost stumbled to the floor .	but
4	86183	I was just coming .	To she reached me .	when
0	149169	Currently her worst problem was her back ; she was sure of it .	Even that was getting better .	and
3	67186	Then surely brady would be in attendance .	Brady 's father was .	if
3	103532	... '' `` you 're damn right i am . '' .	You 're talking about mr. guttman .	if
3	43920	Then i will do it .	That is what i have to do to become a wizard like you .	if
0	153526	He uses accidents , not hitting in the same place .	Covers all of the united states .	and
2	159803	She sat in her work chair .	Swiveled to face him .	but
1	131916	Going to a concert with him .	Their dad said he was too young to go .	because
0	19822	He reached to a top shelf .	Pulled down the most beautiful divining bowl i 'd ever seen .	and
0	52339	Five minutes , cash , '' she requested .	His eyes drilled into hers .	and
2	74987	I 'm sure you 'll get other offers , of course . '' .	This is the big one .	but
3	25023	Help us make it so . ' .	I can put it in star trek terms .	if
0	159839	He pointed to jamie .	The current jonin has taken a gai-jin as a student .	and
3	52672	Everything was just in his head .	- everything was real .	if
4	83775	A hiss escaping her lips .	He settled into the cradle of her hips .	when
4	145039	Theyll tell you what to do with it , ivadot replied .	You receive the package .	when
2	85128	She knew enough to turn over the purse to her mum for safekeeping .	Also realized she needed to depart before any accusations arose .	but
4	68834	How would he feel .	She told him she had to destroy the werewolf .	when
2	56396	They are all heavy sleepers .	Jess is always the heaviest .	but
0	74222	The blond-haired man opened his chest pack .	Removed a small jar filled with blue , translucent putty .	and
2	154032	We had a good time in bed that was all .	Had some nice conversations .	but
0	27494	Once that sword comes out , michael puts his game face on he plays as hard as almost anyone i 've ever seen .	White knight he might be , but .	and
1	29423	He 'd tell her about the eyes on him .	Those eyes could be turning to her .	because
2	115797	I know nothing about your college boyfriend .	Your choice of a pro football player and a tv producer tells me you were , even unconsciously , seeking a man of some power and self-possession .	but
3	156179	Symanta , as prince of snakes , would have known .	She had been told a lie , even a lie of omission .	if
2	62025	Could just be an isolated incident .	The friend knew about the video .	but
2	44015	It might not have been as nice as the one we 'd originally booked .	It was dry inside and away from the river , which was fine .	but
2	116999	She clawed at it .	It was clawing off her own skin .	but
4	29253	They would come here to spend their money .	Tourists tired of visiting old babylon .	when
0	29872	My stomach sank the minute we came around the corner .	Approached the area where family members waited to pick up loved ones .	and
4	98978	How much he liked it .	I told him how i fantasized about him .	when
0	156742	Mack covered jaimie 's plate .	Made certain the men could see his intention to harm anyone trying to come near it .	and
0	103599	There was a sound of shattering glass .	They both sat up to see alec glaring at them .	and
2	34110	To grasp , even with the help of torothexs memories .	His idea that opera was simple-minded was shattered .	but
0	100295	The young prince was carrying a heavy load of grief .	His friendship with our horse helped to take his mind off that .	and
3	34730	I feel . '' .	Our connection is deeper .	if
1	108916	Mac must have been standing above him the whole time .	He grabbed his arm and helped him stand up .	because
0	118846	You never call me unless you want something , you are never there when i need you .	You 're not even monogamous .	and
2	22908	It 's part of the original design and inside the star , in very faint black ink , is a hand-drawn heart that definitely was not a part of the book 's illustration .	Is one of many decorating the robe .	but
2	148044	Jampa spent much of his day helping lhatu and vanida run c3 .	He spent his remaining time assisting his wife with her mission .	but
1	146651	`` and you 're not talking about her . '' .	... something is wrong .	because
2	14538	Pauls going to have my ass when he finds out i gave her chocolate .	I needed to entertain her for a second .	but
3	146945	You 'd have a heart attack .	You woke up to that .	if
0	14460	All of them smelling at the very least like unwashed bodies a complete lack of any attempt at hygiene .	Bedrooms in various states of disarray , thankfully none of them containing bodies , but .	and
2	150367	Once again , he contemplated keeping a journal of the effects of his concentrated focusing .	Then he started remembering the total depression that always came with journaling and felt it better to leave that sort of thing to those who enjoyed their depressions .	but
0	123776	It knocked the nearest fighters off their feet .	Continued , spreading across the field .	and
3	2150	Ay , i must put my shoulders to the wheel .	Jekyll will but let me .	if
3	142219	I wonder . ' .	There 's anything more i can get them to do .	if
0	106023	She yanked him toward her .	They fell to the floor .	and
2	42429	He staggered when his feet hit the floor .	He regained his balance .	but
0	40295	I know you will look after her .	Once she is sold , we can move .	and
2	40194	You can fight all you want .	You 're not going to win .	but
0	55873	Steffor turned toward the reflecting light , his right hand caressing the bark as he went .	Moved in its direction .	and
3	16025	Probably would have hated them .	They had known what the fairies were .	if
4	121701	I open my eyes , not even realize they fell closed .	I hear noise on the stairs .	when
3	20085	I know this great therapist .	I flip out or something .	if
4	116831	Luke was into transformers .	She created the best boy with a hidden robot inside name on the planet .	when
2	107612	I hadnt seen any lights or movement .	It was almost ten oclock , and mid-week .	but
1	121410	It seemed to whet his appetite for her , this time more .	He then pulled her towards him and kissed her .	because
3	103190	Dressed as an 80s boythat takes some serious humility and it really makes me feel special .	You flew across the country .	if
2	109545	I can understand your apprehension .	You must believe me when i tell you that your brother 's case will be treated with the utmost fairness .	but
0	101749	The excitement would fade but for now , several miles out and with the impending challenge to come , he could barely contain his excitement .	Hed be awash with the adrenaline of the moment .	and
0	155540	On top of each side a small , hinged pin , resembling a tiny metal arm , came .	Clamped beneath a perfectly positioned hook on the opposite side .	and
2	54154	There was no mention of the stag in any of my theory books .	I did find a reference to ilya morozova , one of the first and most powerful grisha .	but
0	65914	The night was theirs , with no one .	The stream was isolated he offered want to go skinny dipping with me .	and
0	12759	That the treaties struck between the dark beings and the humans would fail .	War would be an ever-looming prospect .	and
1	73416	Unwilling to listen to reason and all .	She 'd parked the car in the alley .	because
0	6112	They would cripple ceresian crops .	Prevent the local militias from being called up to help the crown against him .	and
3	97305	How reassemble a gun .	As well even it took her nearly an hour .	if
2	65258	I would tell you not to call out , came a whisper from behind it .	I can see thats already been taken care of .	but
0	90711	He should have known when last he 'd come .	The women had been old and diseased , and thrown stones at him and rushed up to scream in his ears .	and
0	134698	The old woman threw her head .	Said , i love antoine .	and
2	141254	Pointing to the path , i reply , we will rent a car for most of the journey .	A stealth approach is preferred even if they are not dacian .	but
1	121853	That sought me out .	She thought i was one of the angels someone had told her were sent to help people .	because
2	26817	Visiting this weekend clarissa .	I think its time for you to go home .	but
4	37861	The truth was like a wicked slap .	You were least expecting it .	when
1	158846	They overlooked your tardiness or outright absence from roll call .	They themselves are both members of this social club .	because
3	18640	`` but why would you expect him home ? '' .	You kicked him out .	if
2	91025	Yes , kissing finally , sip by sip , he empties the pot .	Begging , threatening , and .	but
2	101966	The sky was nearly black .	There was an eerie green glow all across the horizon that silhouetted the skeletal shape of the porpoise behind us .	but
2	98911	I 'm sure that 's what tom believed .	I fear i failed him .	but
2	125048	Maybe she was a member .	She was a doubting thomas .	but
2	142923	They can scent who 's inside the magic . '' .	It 's dull and off base , a scent .	but
4	95332	A collective sigh went up from the group and said simply , `` all i want and need is you . '' .	Shaw smiled up at him through the tears running down her face .	when
4	155386	Their nightly email conversations had ended .	Megan had come to the farm and , until that day , almost all of their free time had been the three of them .	when
3	20163	You were risking your neck-again-or .	The sightings were all false .	if
2	121715	The recreation boats downstream will be wrecked .	More importantly the cooling water for the nuclear power plants will back up like a toilet when your turds are too big to go through the drainage hole .	but
0	62805	She took off her large hat .	Began fanning her face with it .	and
2	41689	`` no girls popping out of cakes , '' he assured her , `` .	It 's definitely men .	but
2	2195	I had agreed to anything .	Being alone with him .	but
1	130887	She was enraged . '' .	She thought cassidy cutler was setting her up to take the fall .	because
0	10708	He turned his head on the pillow .	Looked at her , his golden eyes sober and intent .	and
0	109945	`` they will feed .	Kill with crazed abandon .	and
0	140882	Fallon stared into the forest , a rueful look on his face .	Slowly turned back to kaspar .	and
2	35742	She expected anger , laughter , or a shrug before he turned .	Spade drew off his shirt .	but
0	38182	He was licking at his hacked-about talons .	Making grimaces with his mouth , pulling his lips back from his serrated teeth and forward again , spitting occasionally a little bit of blood upon the ground , but plainly he had taken no great harm .	and
0	113019	What was done to you was wrong .	Has no justification that is acceptable to me .	and
0	20155	Shanna appeared to be handling things okay .	They should stop at the lightning station as kenny had suggested .	and
0	75800	Which her body adored .	Therefore it automatically melted under his .	and
3	16996	What was i holding back ? '' .	I was willing to give them this as a warning burst .	if
2	70510	He gets to travel around the world , and nothing better than paris , france .	Seeing new places does have its appeal .	but
3	135201	It would leave me out in the open , with a vengeful and enraged naagloshii to keep me company .	Even i managed to do it .	if
2	11477	I understand your hesitation .	Many people will draw too much attention .	but
2	119583	It was a heavy schedule .	He knew he would never find anything more interesting than what he had been exposed to in the last few months .	but
4	122846	At nine that evening , chad became agitated .	Peter did not return from a simple errand .	when
0	78517	Back at jesse and ericas home , she lay on the couch .	Stared at the ceiling .	and
2	94434	They were in black clothing and the immortals all had good eyesight .	The woman was barely recognizable as female .	but
4	95686	It was a welcome relief .	George came to his office one day and interrupted his endless steam of thoughts .	when
0	110198	He crossed the room to the glowing computer screen .	Looked at the data that the highly specialized search program had collected while he was fooling around on the sofa with isabel .	and
1	38677	The bitterness must have been apparent in her eyes and tone .	His whole demeanor changed .	because
0	148995	It had been diluted flushed by the storm .	There had been blood , but ; now that the rain was abating , some of the wounded were leaking red puddles .	and
0	115297	Pointing at one of the wines .	Winking at the serving woman .	and
2	25756	You have a mighty big head , ill grant you that , luminaria chuckled at her own joke .	You are not the most powerful wizard in the world .	but
2	46034	He was always in her thoughts .	Was he thinking about her .	but
0	2633	He had packed some smoked meat along with some vegetables he got from mcgrady .	Went to work making a stew .	and
0	66625	We were at my locker .	He 'd stopped to ask me something .	and
2	21550	She knew it was wrong .	She adored his name .	but
0	78750	Morning , dylan , dad and kaitlin said at the same time .	Then looked at each other and smiled .	and
4	38679	The film , destiny , closely paralleled enzo 's possible past life .	He had possibly been leonardo and valeria .	when
1	122906	I just laughed and played .	He wasnt that different from the other kids .	because
0	156263	It was lifeless his pleas went unanswered .	Lodden paused by the water but .	and
2	86023	The walls are sea-foam green , and , set slightly back in cubbies like the openings to catacombs bolted tight with queer rectangular iron locks .	There are many shuttered windows and dark wooden arched doors with tarnished brass knobs .	but
0	33743	I looked at tony .	Felt my heart squeeze a little bit .	and
2	51271	I 'm not saying i know what i 'm doing .	I know who i can trust .	but
4	124209	What happens ? ' .	You find your ship .	when
2	64773	Dating back to its origins .	Five , seven , five , is now the official standard format .	but
0	136563	Your father knew all this .	Used his position to secure the greatest thing of all : power .	and
0	47759	To meet his gaze .	Domenico felt fear enveloping him .	and
2	42247	Charlie and george continued on .	Dickie decided to rest under the shade of a tree where he saw an old man with his head against the tree reading a newspaper .	but
2	20070	Both men had come .	Had no more success than ian in changing mueller 's conviction that he had been cheated .	but
0	31906	I cross the river .	Make for them cliffs on the opposite side .	and
1	160219	Pamelas interpretation must have been completely different .	She patted the dog on his head and said hes a good boy .	because
2	25217	Ragged jenna and laughing lord are still playing pirate on the river , i have heard ? '' .	Who can say if it is .	but
1	99795	His thoughts must have been the same .	Their pace quickened as they hurried across the street and into the hotel .	because
3	54323	Well , i began congrats .	Even you did steel it .	if
0	62714	Aylee pulled her boy aside , yes she does .	Settled onto the box where the attendant had been .	and
2	46675	She had no choice to try walking on both feet .	Now her good leg felt as bad as the injured one , and .	but
4	59051	I almost dropped to my knees .	She took a step .	when
3	99209	It 's not much of a week .	You still go in to the offices .	if
2	119609	He eased out of the small room to leave .	Turned back to say something .	but
0	41112	To help carry down the wounded .	Bear them back to the watercrafters working at the tubs in the courtyard .	and
2	158815	`` soon you 'll want a man for changing lightbulbs and .	Mowing the front yard .	but
3	72196	To start another batch of cookies .	They were to be done by the end of the week .	if
2	89321	The creatures had non-human qualities .	They also had human ones .	but
2	115859	At least it would cover the cracks in my armor and .	Stop any of the corrosive gasses from getting to my skin .	but
4	16550	So we move from my doorway and sit on the steps , and her eyes grow wider at the fish out of water studios part , they become saucers .	I tell her about qbert , and then she shrieks as i recount the news of my on-air admission .	when
0	154619	It reached out from her .	Enveloped sre lugu in its cold and dark .	and
0	4841	The scale was tipped .	He tumbled down the stairs backwards , his body landing in a heap on the middle landing .	and
3	152168	Mr crepsley would have objected , but in the normal run of things he was satisfied to follow my command .	He disagreed with my decision .	if
1	25081	I came to this place at last , the part after which there is nothing .	I am a wanderer , and after going to and fro on the earth and walking up and down on it .	because
3	94673	My plan will only work .	Everyone thinks the same way .	if
4	33399	Fully armed with a live grenade in my teeth and flamethrower in my hands and face cherise gautier .	She 's in nick-protection mode .	when
2	20288	The buzzing increased at her entrance .	The wasps kept their distance for now and morgan wondered what made them attack .	but
4	29385	So i felt pretty much like i had completed a graduate course in the science he had presented .	He was done with his lecture .	when
3	72365	I try to numb the pain with her encouragement .	Even everything still hurts .	if
0	55613	Anne leapt out of bed scooped up the mirror .	Ran to the wash table .	and
4	153971	He was willing to endure .	He thought he would be ruling over their species .	when
2	625	His father spoke no further to elec .	What had happened to them , aeona and anthalion both offered him words of support .	but
4	7617	Peter hungrily grabbed the scroll .	Imhotep handed it over .	when
2	33443	Things at school have calmed down .	Security is still tight .	but
4	78826	And show about brides picking out wedding dresses at a fancy new york boutique-the girliest , most off-putting thing she could think of-he simply sat down beside her , spreading his arms across the back of the couch .	She turned on the television and switched it to a reality .	when
0	115123	There could be a hundred vampires in the building .	She would never know it .	and
1	2406	Although she admitted occasionally trying to psychoanalyze people , it wasnt .	She wanted to pry .	because
0	135287	His arms were long but it dragged across his wrist as i dodged him .	My sword was longer .	and
0	86054	Ducked into another alley .	Glanced over my shoulder .	and
4	83503	His eyes are rimmed with tears .	He looks back up at me .	when
2	132101	He turned away , unhappy .	Knowing why he had to stand down .	but
4	120019	According to our elders nivaton was one of its fourteen provinces .	Northsam still ruled akea .	when
0	3721	His breath sounded against the plate of his helm .	His feet crunched in sand .	and
3	160409	`` but you must decide .	You want be with me or .	if
4	67216	I found that i was kneeling in dust and chips , the stones beneath my knees reduced entirely to rubble .	I opened my eyes .	when
0	139118	She 'd met lorraine in new york last year .	Had just heard she 'd died .	and
4	69307	Her his sword craft and a pang of jealousy had risen in him .	She took to it so immediately that within two years she was far more skilled than he had been at her age when master h-jen had instructed him in the traditional shorvorian style .	when
4	56014	How could he be so careless .	It came to bethany .	when
1	67508	I was losing my appeal .	She 'd never talk to me .	because
0	116144	To find the sword of light .	Take it back to his evil master in the north .	and
4	103904	That gets harder , wearing pants and one of those wrap around blouses that accent her body in all the right places - pouting .	Bella comes down the steps from the upper floor .	when
2	124999	The alliance of the nephilim is seraphic .	If it were demonic , they 'd still be as strong , as powerful as they are .	but
0	57755	She hated me , always . '' .	Made certain by her words and her deeds that i knew just how much she hated me .	and
0	21240	He grinned up at me , dark blue eyes alight with pleasure .	What looked like pride .	and
3	47742	She would only be jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire .	She let herself get involved with him .	if
2	39869	He was well aware that houston had appealed to his vanity .	The fact that houston had been aware that this was the approach that was necessary to reinvest bowies allegiance had weighed quite positively on bowie .	but
2	1793	She shuddered and he held her legs in his arms , and he was controlling how far she could open or close them .	Tried to spread her legs wider .	but
2	33227	I already do . '' .	Max ... you can not just disappear like that .	but
4	133392	He looked at it curiously , wondering if it was as powerful as dirty harry swinnerton had claimed .	The rifle was loaded .	when
4	94744	You could do that .	You had your own car .	when
2	62112	She 'd attempted to hide in the house .	Kimi insisted on setting her up under a small white tent .	but
4	111211	His eyes and my heart jumps .	I notice how close his face is to mine .	when
0	40247	I walked out of there .	I walked all the way back home .	and
0	30321	In the end he added a few more pieces to the handful of fine metals held it out to toler .	Calistari chewed his lip , but .	and
1	11181	And i didnt mean .	I was a siren .	because
4	105065	She smiles and nods . '' .	He speaks and he is all charm and concern .	when
0	131117	A large blue butterfly fluttered in from the window .	Capella snapped her fingers .	and
2	81203	Dad looked close to fainting .	I knew he 'd hold it .	but
3	145126	To ask you to go on back to the diner and let me take care of this matter .	You dont mind id .	if
3	86070	And she 'd had no idea how true intimacy would escalate the pleasure and creativity of their encounters .	Their first time and their semi-aborted wedding night had been world-shaking .	if
3	79896	Which she could never afford .	She still wanted to fit into her clothes .	if
0	80800	Titto looked at the frightened face of thompson family and reached for the pistol .	Reached for his belt .	and
4	61297	They had graduated to straw , then food , and now rocks .	They realized vika would not tell jecis .	when
3	66989	You might get stuck inside it .	You 're not careful .	if
0	64380	This newcomer continued on towards town .	Scratched at the stubble sprouting on his chin .	and
4	21047	When she was young .	That was probably i had her tested to make sure paul was her father and not you .	when
0	27551	They passed through the walls , across the short space .	Arrived at his ears .	and
0	128921	When i finished , i took the water from jill .	Added the same amount that was in the original instructions .	and
0	69315	What kept the woodland alive .	Regenerating itselfall of these .	and
1	150670	To get your side of what is going on with this war on terror by the government .	You all are not like the people we see or hear about on television you are just normal kids like us .	because
4	29867	How respectful you sounded .	The pastor showed up .	when
4	97875	And , then settled in for a nice , long , lovely worship of her lips , she decided she 'd made the right choice .	His mouth brushed over hers .	when
4	32632	I cut through the tightly packed room to the deck .	I was finally relieved at the bar .	when
0	136568	Wed gone into the church on the corner of charlton place .	Sung the songs and prayed .	and
2	110009	A small path from the door to the desk was cleared .	There was nowhere to sit .	but
4	30794	His face and fingers looked cleanscrubbedand .	He stepped close to greet her .	when
2	41545	I know you must be confused about all this .	Your aunt will explain everything to you in detail .	but
0	86279	First order of business , he poured himself a cup of coffee -- cream , no sugar -- , the waves crashing on the sand .	Sipped it as he looked down at the beach below .	and
0	137106	Where air comes in buckets .	Pours just like beer .	and
3	47436	She was asking him .	He intended to go to bed .	if
3	57665	Later , she had called and asked .	I could send her copies of the times when it mentioned rhoda 's case .	if
2	13233	He 'd always loved her curvy body .	She seemed happier thinner .	but
0	51728	He took my hand in his we went out into the cool night air and the smell of the sea .	That made him shake his head , but .	and
3	31478	I hear a woman 's voice ask , `` do you know ? '' .	She needs tampons or pads .	if
4	137913	I can be intimate with lachlan .	I feel no love for him .	when
2	86217	Zane would have avoided exploring in the past .	Now he could admit why .	but
2	116948	Jim said his dad has owned it ever since tom was a baby .	He hardly ever drives it .	but
2	40784	She might be trapped in some heated argument with him , and .	Things could get out of hand .	but
2	25787	Both you were being stubborn .	I was , of course , ignored .	but
2	2452	Isabelle spoke lightly : `` anyway , i 'm glad you texted me when you did .	Clary could tell that her mind was working , ticking over various possibilities .	but
4	34698	It was ten to midnight on that fateful day .	The new berg baby arrived in the world at palmerston north hospital and the exhausted mother smiled up at john , doctor simone downie and a hospital gynaecologist .	when
2	159888	His luceria trembled at his throat and finger .	He could detect no colors swirling in its pale depths .	but
0	13199	Sam picked up the loaded revolver .	Headed downtown to the golden guitar saloon .	and
0	106292	This was not sweet , this was charged , greedy .	That was coming from the both of us .	and
4	93300	I only do that .	It 's too small or young to be eaten .	when
0	103319	The male glanced toward the bedroom then walked into the kitchen to open the fridge and pull out a bottle .	Seemed to say something .	and
1	38493	Nashua knew this ( though he had sat out most of the hands that night ) and two of the deputies escorted him from the town .	He had been booted from the saloon during a particularly rapacious speech about how he had been cheated and robbed while playing poker .	because
2	53074	That melted a streak of bubbling rock several yards .	Failed to strike the challenger .	but
3	153830	We 'll drive them back with dragon fire .	They get too close to the cave .	if
2	140777	She staggered back , and i did n't . .	I wanted to reach out and hold her .	but
0	56409	It has to be you .	You have to come .	and
3	155878	I 'm sure the darkhavens would be just as interested in it as you are .	That book contains insight into current dealings with the rogues .	if
0	126654	Everyone knows that king ine will do nothing without first discussing the matter with lord brogan .	No one but rafe will do to be his emissary since lord brogan retired from service .	and
2	67691	It wasnt often hed come to the country house .	When he did it was special .	but
3	160334	He was going to have to eat some pizza .	He wanted to walk out under his own power .	if
0	38831	Blood dribbled down the woman 's pale skin .	Stained her white dress .	and
3	108383	Devon would go crazy and joey would not react kindly to her presence in his home .	She was not near him .	if
0	42873	I wound my way through town down to the lake , slowed for the deer , looking for the one described to me by unger .	Poked on past the marinas .	and
2	82081	Frank was plodding along slowly , making sure to stay on the road .	Jason knew it was going to take them hours to get home at this rate .	but
0	133666	Am tired of living .	I can not die .	and
0	5080	Which had totally spiralled out of control .	She was serving 18 months .	and
4	62710	That came out of his lips .	He realized his mistake .	when
0	49462	Hesitate grab a section of my hair .	I lift my hand , my first instinct to put it on his chest , but .	and
3	76044	The rule book would 've been thicker than the bible .	They 'd been put down in writing .	if
3	27968	The time she lurched for the huge wagon wheels would have ended in disaster .	Her slipper had not slid in the mud and slowed her scramble for death .	if
4	116220	I need you , miss benjamins heart fluttered .	Abra uttered these words .	when
2	64863	I was deathly worried about ivy .	That was probably fair play .	but
2	29839	He 'd offered her his loyalty and his devotion .	Had held his heart in reserve .	but
2	113608	It is different for everyone .	It chases us all .	but
3	34322	He will contact me . '' .	You are ever in need of my help .	if
2	55112	A doe killed otherwise untouched , outside the entrance to the cave , and .	She labored all day to skin the animal and slice off the meat in thin strips that she hung to dry in the cave over a smokey fire .	but
2	104076	They also bore weapons .	Cassie knew it would be anne that came for her , if that was even her real name .	but
3	68259	What to feel or .	She was capable of feeling anything .	if
3	43016	Id have had my revenge .	This idiot with the shotgun hadnt shown up when he did .	if
0	74899	She unhooked the clasp of the chain handed it to him .	Drew off the necklace .	and
2	135443	I wanted to hold my breath .	There was another odor infused with it , one that caught my attention .	but
3	40976	Obviously you have to practice a lot .	You want to be an expert marksman .	if
2	86645	I tried to get up , with both of my arms flat underneath my body .	Was momentarily pinned on my stomach .	but
3	125271	It 'll be better .	He hears it from me instead of brand .	if
0	132479	To take you to an armourer .	Allow you to select some fine armour .	and
3	73882	'' i snarled , `` i will wipe the floor with your face .	You ever go near my grandparents .	if
2	80645	I do love how you see the funny side of it . '' .	What i love most is how wel you take care of everyone you can .	but
4	1241	She was more than halfway to the center of the cavern .	She heard a sharp intake of breath from warren .	when
4	17750	That i feared bil y was going to have a seizure .	He saw the price on the side of the box .	when
4	28316	Prissi drops fairs hand and in her most enthusiastic voice says , lets climb it so we can see the sun come up .	They get close to the rock .	when
0	137428	Let him out the house except to go to work .	Even then theyre dropping him off and picking him up .	and
4	15768	Regaining my breath , i made my way .	The sound of another train came from the fog uphill .	when
4	27501	In these days the governor must speak with the voice of the people , with the knowledge that the majority have chosen , and that all the people accept that choice .	Inferno is waking from its long slumber to find that all is .	when
0	91785	I now dashed out of the house .	Crossed the small patch of grass that separated my house and the garage .	and
3	88237	He had never really thought about what those words meant .	He was being honest with himself .	if
2	56960	Standing , joshua york seemed to tower over the seated damon julian .	Somehow he did not dominate .	but
0	84694	The movie is rolling , the creatures are stirring .	The brainwashed teenagers are ready to welcome a new star from the other side of the grave .	and
3	39777	She 's quite capable of doing it herself , i 'm sure . '' .	She wants to get this published .	if
1	119772	He discerned that they belonged to one of the giants , come to pay his dead ancestors homage where they rested in the mounds .	The glowing orbs hovered 8 feet above the ground .	because
0	134064	Pulling her up to him .	Whispered , not for a minute .	and
2	99646	The fear appears on the front porch , in soft footsteps and tiny voices they are all out to get you , theyre coming to get you , the voices outside know all about you and what you did theyre coming to get all of you .	The rest of the crack-heads sitting around you dont know this , they cant hear the things you can hear , only you can hear .	but
2	3339	Joey 's head was bowed as he slept in his chair .	Patrick was awake and watching them .	but
2	94970	I can not guarantee it .	I hope to have an explanation for you later in the day .	but
2	72556	He was a nice character , inoffensive nervous , but , but it was easier said than done i suppose .	I wished he stuck up for himself a bit more when hopper occasionally berated him .	but
3	11614	The poor man would no doubt oblige .	She wanted paul to propose marriage to her this weekend .	if
0	96898	Emban grunted , waddled to the map of eosia hanging on the wall of sir nashan 's study .	Laboriously hauled himself to his feet .	and
2	104253	Cassie wished she was feeling more confident about her friendship with diana .	It seemed out of sorts , just like everything .	but
2	97210	He promised to keep silent until the end of the year .	Encouraged her to tell the headmaster , especially after reading the letter from her mom .	but
2	157063	I know i was in and out of it back in the cabin , alex . '' .	Your mom said you were another apol .	but
2	56716	I grunted when dovie opened her mouth to argue .	She was bleeding badly enough that the cop inclined his head to the paramedics that were rolling in a stretcher .	but
0	5945	Cratos shot some more trolls to get their attention .	Proceeded to cut them to bits .	and
0	125817	I took mouse on his morning walk , filled up a plastic sports bottle with cold water .	Headed for the door .	and
0	19686	Few moments later , the door opened .	He saw simard with a haggard look .	and
4	90974	He said , `` get naked .	A girl 's voice answered .	when
2	72579	He had spent the beginning of his life running around from place to place in the dreamscape .	Lyght had never undertaken something as strenuous as leading a large group of peers in difficult situations .	but
0	79891	He bides in my court .	I assure you that we afford his body all the respect we would give a living shadowhunter .	and
0	49676	At frey 's shaking head , father went on , `` .	At your return , you did not received a briefing ? '' .	and
2	156396	For a moment in time they were held suspended in thin air as mark made a desperate reach for the root .	His grasping fingers were feet away from being able to grab their only lifeline .	but
1	138405	Did i do it .	I knew that had my parents been living they would never allow me to go .	because
0	63403	His dress shirt was disheveled , a vein pulsed at his neck .	A lock of blond hair had fallen straight over his left eye .	and
0	82433	The norsemen crested the rise as the rain began to lash down harder , splashing from their heavy sea-capes and the backs and flanks of their mounts .	There it was , ahead of them .	and
0	84346	She could have told you of her daughter , twelve years old and already eight months pregnant by an overseer .	How they dug a hole in the red earth to take her daughter 's pregnant belly , and then they whipped her until her back had bled .	and
0	97283	Operated , there for handicapped customers and shipment transport .	Was almost never used .	and
2	12390	A few of them are down in the dumps . '' .	You know how that goes .	but
2	72351	`` valerie , i know it 's saturday .	I need you to do me a favor .	but
2	35443	Born in sierra leone .	Educated since the age of seven in the uk .	but
3	66307	Too , my conscience will hold up under the burden . '' .	She has to suffer .	if
0	50200	The blade protruded from his chest momentarily , leaving behind a corpse that would puzzle the surviving soldiers .	Then vanished from the wound .	and
2	132469	Leo was doing a fair job of shining the light where gaent needed it .	He managed to repeatedly get in teria 's way .	but
4	43314	Seven morgan woke up .	I opened the bedroom door .	when
4	10874	Greg had headed in .	Bill came out of her office .	when
2	146557	She was nearly wiped .	She managed to create another energy ball .	but
3	115867	As she hung up the phone , she wondered .	She felt the same way .	if
0	67558	You could sleep a few hours . '' .	Look it over with fresh eyes .	and
1	42418	Truly a relief , hed taken .	It was a crapshoot .	because
0	153999	Those were the fading years .	In them the last flowering of the elves east of the sea came to its winter .	and
2	53869	He called her name .	All he heard was his own echo .	but
0	65528	The lights on stage brightened , then ; the students went quiet .	Whatever lights there had been in the rest of the room dimmed .	and
2	73716	It had been kitchen implements instead of duelling pistols at dawn .	The result was the same : two bodies in the morgue at k.v.h .	but
2	18658	He had figured it out after working with her over the years .	Had never revealed the full truth , only doling out small clues for me .	but
0	87331	All that came back to her was a voicemail from daniel harding , chairman of copass secret death vampire , in which he spoke one word .	Contacting copass again , trying to impress on that worthless entity that owen stannett needed to be removed from service as high administrator of the fortress , but .	and
2	116846	I know its fake .	I really dig wrestling .	but
4	36913	It was always this way .	He found someone new .	when
2	85441	Who is a truly sweet , good-hearted girl .	Born a little simple in her wits .	but
0	70568	It 's absolutely huge rising up some forty feet from floor to ceiling .	Dominating an entire side of the building .	and
0	110953	He was there one moment . '' .	Then he was gone .	and
0	141726	I hurried to the kitchen , nibbling at some fruits as i did .	Prepared a meal of sausages , potatoes and greens .	and
2	50043	He managed to get out in one piece .	While the gates were open , every camera out there was trained on tasia .	but
0	130617	Merlin settled in and what occurred after .	Told them the story of his awakening .	and
2	104345	I was an adult .	At least it was something .	but
4	98043	He gave her an unsmiling salute before she turned .	He met her eyes .	when
2	86710	I understand where shes coming from .	Shes not usually the person who cares about what anyone thinks .	but
4	124733	We mounted our pegasus , and he lead us back to titan .	Eon received the signal ( whatever that was .	when
0	63791	The stag had fallen on his side , breathing heavily , his black eyes wide and panicked .	Lay in the snow .	and
0	68829	You could really hurt him .	I will not have .	and
2	135949	The guard gritted his teeth .	Kept his mouth shut .	but
0	156276	He leapt into its back .	Hovered down the smoldering ocean of flame .	and
1	34794	What my level was .	It would soon be all too revealed .	because
1	114993	It hadnt been haughtiness .	She was a zadmchov , stubbornness , or indifference that kept her quiet , secretive .	because
0	148268	I thought of the carving callum had sent me .	Remembered all the times growing up that i 'd seen him with a piece of wood in his hands .	and
0	24225	Breathlessly , the priestess stammered , trying to form a curse .	Her words were echoed back to her from a pair of jaws creaking open upon the creature 's forehead .	and
4	71158	From his impressively dirty 4x4 there was a collective sigh of appreciation from the girls .	He called out to the waiting group .	when
0	120724	*** that night , i pulled the room 's telephone onto my lap .	Dialed my home telephone number until the answering machine picked up .	and
2	21611	They used to be a disgusting yellow .	She recalled the old room fondly despite the putrid color .	but
0	4745	`` take the juice to her . '' .	Entertain her until i come up .	and
2	100203	She turned her attention to a yellow light at the base of the screen that had been annoying her since she 'd begun .	She 'd been too preoccupied to deal with .	but
0	97435	She saw his expression .	Asked him what was wrong .	and
4	59450	How her worst suspicions had all turned out to be true , he reaches out and places a hand on top of hers .	She tells him about the funeral in paddington .	when
3	131207	I should 've noticed .	Taylor had been harboring murderous thoughts his whole life , or if he had slipped into insanity during the war .	if
1	103006	To run from the plane before her ziploc seal ripped .	It gave her the perfect excuse .	because
2	91541	She 'd known that the ships did passive gas monitoring .	It had never occurred to her that stray molecules of her explosive would get caught in the filters , or that anyone would check .	but
2	141303	`` i can do battle with anything i can see or feel , cass . '' .	When it comes to ghosts of deceitful lovers , i 'm out of my league .	but
3	149533	To paddle through the middle .	You had any chance of making it to the other side .	if
2	127082	You will be in my heart .	Daygun has my heart and soul .	but
0	72375	Thal explained why he had acted as he did .	Mileko went back to staring at the fire .	and
0	154074	Straight ahead , hamish said .	Then ducked into the darkness .	and
2	92713	I appreciate the sentiment , lord jason .	I 'll decide when my penance is done for turning my back on good causes .	but
4	12720	I am teetering on the edge of consciousness .	I recognize the swagger of michael evans walking towards me .	when
2	115235	Bruce was mildly curious to know what they did .	He 'd made a decision long ago not to get too involved with the people he commanded .	but
0	43317	She pulled a cigarette from her pack .	Placed it between her lips .	and
3	16206	You would ask a venefica .	She 's sure that someone is being poisoned .	if
3	155625	Then these men have been responsible , viciously responsible ; we are not to rely on their character . '' .	The dragons are not feral .	if
2	82951	She felt bad for leaving misty in the rain .	Comforted herself with the knowledge that wild horses remained outside in all kinds of weather .	but
1	136030	Later that afternoon , they exited the cab away from the stores in order to stroll .	They had the time and why the hell .	because
0	138234	That reached far below his skin .	Soothed him on levels he 'd never imagined he possessed .	and
4	72091	He got the entrance he wanted and i quickly slipped from indignant and annoyed to something squishy and foreign that made my heart rate pick up and my pulse flutter jerkily under my skin .	He pulled my hair just hard enough to make me huff out a breath of pain .	when
2	81395	Monica was being manipulative .	How could she not feel sorry for the other woman .	but
0	137798	One of the knights aeris who had not been hit began to weave the air into a shield of turbulence .	Arrows began to abruptly veer and miss .	and
2	11890	I was too stunned to speak or move .	Eventually honored him with an embarrassingly weak handshake .	but
0	48162	You do not shut .	Let me tell it to you .	and
0	126460	Sonia turned her back to the door .	Slid down it until her bottom hit the floor .	and
0	35344	She smiled and said shed had fun too before walking .	Punched him in the arm .	and
2	137754	He told himself to step aside and reach for his pistol .	He heard his doom , and then he saw it .	but
0	139476	For one , she was a virgin ; ; three , she didnt know when her twin brothers and mother would come through the door .	For two , she wasnt on birth control .	and
3	90265	I must be very quiet .	I 'm to avoid him .	if
1	158554	But my escort doesnt seem to mind .	He smiles an amused smile .	because
0	114349	Billy set her down perfect , then , just as we had planned he taxied to the north end of the strip and parked .	Let the boys out on the south end of the runway .	and
4	131265	I led lucas out of the planetarium as we both blinked .	The show ended , and the lights came on .	when
3	3736	`` and , he would sink his teeth in and hold fast to his point .	You got him arguing .	if
3	88090	`` , i have .	You 've made mistakes .	if
0	81326	Quickly he shut the box .	The dizzying pull of the trap vanished .	and
0	21146	She got into the passenger seat in front .	Boyfriend nelson settled into the backseat beside me .	and
0	95605	You can not rip somebody from their universe then transplant them back again without some damage occurring .	Throw them into another to breathe alien air or gas or whatever .	and
0	71690	An ogre is constantly learning from himself .	It is right and good that he pass information on to others .	and
4	158604	Cameron asked after a few seconds .	I stopped rubbing my eyes .	when
4	67135	They could get from the others on the roof .	They were the farthest .	when
4	20224	Seeing the meandering river on the maps .	I first looked at two med .	when
2	89094	We stayed very good friends .	Lost touch after a few years .	but
2	17730	`` she pays me enough . '' .	She insists on feeding me .	but
1	58194	They 've talked to the press .	We had the soldiers there at the end .	because
3	60005	`` would you be very disappointed ? '' .	It 's a girl .	if
4	100316	And , who chose to continue the fight .	You could have waited until morning .	when
0	19033	Which she gave to me .	Then sent me on my way .	and
0	118821	Them wear the protection crystals .	Keep them from harm .	and
2	159138	It was a hamlet of thirty square blocks , under a forest of redwood trees that towered over a potpourri of cracker box homes , many of which hadnt ever been renovated .	Were destined to be fixed up , as home prices were escalating faster than anywhere in america .	but
0	109382	After shuffling through the pile , he put the majority .	Handed us a small pile .	and
4	131700	The quiet things that no one ever knows '' by brand new had popped .	Alex started the engine .	when
2	154163	In the long term , xavier prince had neither the time nor the desire to have a prolonged conflict with this man .	He dared not appear weak in the presence of any rooster at any time .	but
2	53169	Were there any legal proceedings filed - again , rumor ran afire it seemed reasonable to believe the legend that erica refused to name her assailants .	Curiously , the principals hammer falling and demanding their suspension never came , nor .	but
0	25537	The autopilot or the kid flying did something weird .	The snoring pilot and i both hit the instrument panel .	and
0	155223	Quickly he looked under the strangers robes , as the book of eden was laid open .	He knew thats how they survived .	and
4	7768	He got them from the drama department .	Colored spotlights burned out .	when
2	131276	I knew she had every right to be pissed , considering i 'd been avoiding her texts over the past few days .	I still plunked out something lighthearted .	but
2	114067	He would post them when he had actually left these places , so even if they were to be intercepted he would have already left .	I would know he was safe .	but
2	33509	The other druids refused to help .	Your twin was the cause of the invasion .	but
2	152819	Her daughter had been one .	She 'd died in the line of duty .	but
0	60319	The raging hound dropped the blanket .	Launched itself at his quarrys unprotected throat once more .	and
2	100587	Maybe i can dig in and . '' .	Defend a corner of it .	but
0	8380	The invisible ball quickly filled .	Began to expand like a silver balloon .	and
0	141257	Sean had a few scratches , silent signals of andrea 's mating frenzy .	Bite marks on his flesh .	and
3	50515	I seebut i dont care .	You did cause today you need to go to the resort to assist every people who enjoys and spend their vacations .	if
1	70990	The gods were punishing us .	Jaime murdered the rightful king .	because
0	159733	`` yes , '' he breathed .	Bit his own arm .	and
2	114403	Her whole body tensing in fearful anticipation as the fiery embers rained down on her face and neck .	There was no pain .	but
3	11097	`` , i 'll kill sam quick . '' .	You 'll kick her ass .	if
0	131210	We 're twenty hours in now . '' .	This thing is still wide open .	and
2	97061	They should wind things up .	No one noticed his impatience .	but
4	30479	She did so hoping rachel misread it , and it said `` paul '' instead of `` phillip '' .	She snatched the phone from rachel to read the text .	when
3	69981	What i would do .	I discovered it really was me killing those people .	if
1	50363	Clearly , the thought of what he might do with the hot knives wasnt pleasant .	Cameron watched the blood drain from their faces .	because
0	36192	Her skin was a deep blue-black , unsettlingly reminiscent of the hard , glistening shade she 'd worn as an ifrit instead of an ifrit 's diamond-sharp claws she had fingernails .	Painted a rich , hot gold .	and
0	103519	Desperate arms swung out held on .	Grabbed an overhanging branch .	and
0	4687	She recognized the black fur , the glowing green eyes .	Pulled to the side of the road .	and
2	132401	A squeak or growl did i hear , cobwebs , that was to be expected , for what old tunnel in the dark .	Yes there were cobwebs .	but
4	45751	But , she planted her hands on his chest .	He put her on her feet .	when
4	159601	He straightened his thin framed glasses and doubled over panting as he struggled to catch his breath .	He finally caught up with us .	when
4	123733	The assembled men gasped .	They saw the neatly arrayed fifty pound notes filling the case to the brim .	when
4	85487	Anyway , i remember checking my clock and it said it was two-fourteen in the morning .	I was done with that second album .	when
3	138731	Truly great longevity , think what modern science must have meant to them after thousands of years of alchemy .	These creatures have longevity .	if
0	81953	It had picked up tons of debris - rocks , trees , a mountain 's worth of topsoil .	Carried it barreling down .	and
4	3929	You got yourself into this situation .	You got a little more gropey than you should have .	when
2	71146	She did not speak .	She was most eloquent .	but
0	36868	There was a long , tense silence .	Then he shoved his chair back with such force it landed on the floor with a clatter .	and
0	74680	I woke up the following morning .	Rani was the first thing that i thought of ; i was so eager to see her .	and
0	35881	Well search these lofts .	Hope hes found a warm spot in one of them .	and
2	135723	Most covered their heads in fear .	She continued to look up in confused curiosity .	but
4	53873	You can take me to task for saying the word frak .	The cylons explode our world and we 're aboard a spaceship in a ragtag convoy trying to stay alive and find earth .	when
0	38358	The word was already buzzing in the chat rooms that an imp had been busted by the king of weres for holding a pureblood captive .	He was hiding in st. louis .	and
4	100666	The blank mask slipped over his face , concealing his reaction .	He realized they were al watching him .	when
0	46	All the miroth were part of our empire once , and thus the creation of the sunken land .	We were involved in the fall of kevor .	and
4	149796	I 'm going to give you his head as a present .	I 'm at full strength .	when
4	81404	The gps was accurate .	She switched that on .	when
3	102596	They will demand your head for it .	Your mad pet destroys their beloved baby sister .	if
3	80437	It 's a good idea .	You guys come out .	if
4	62771	She and samuel should talk about it .	Later he was home .	when
0	56011	Victor face grew angry .	He looked at me .	and
3	50894	`` , '' he went on slowly , `` what would you do to find it , to protect it ? '' .	There was a possible cure for rabidism .	if
2	65137	George had played college football at purdue and decided to stay in school and pursue his doctorate .	Had even been drafted by the packers .	but
2	97698	Translation had mentioned angelic offspring , i had never considered the possibilities half-angel children might present .	Even mentioned them as being abnormal .	but
2	95822	The dawsons set a slow pace along the great road .	Cade found it did not trouble him .	but
4	142193	I know a good thing . '' .	I 've found it .	when
2	57447	He 'd have to do that if you told him to ... ... '' she kept talking about the specifics of their deal .	I was focused on the two most important words she 'd said .	but
3	64848	Why did he care .	She wanted the money .	if
2	65491	The two hours passed and .	The wind began to whip new snow through the trees .	but
4	58558	She was so beautiful , she would definitely be miss universe .	She was at her most ridiculous so for this performance .	when
1	82261	She screamed something awful .	It hurt and the boar scared her .	because
3	37488	Pigafetta asked and said he was a christian and knew the way but , when it came time to leave after a couple of weeks , this man could not be found and the ships had no pilot .	There were any men here who knew how to go to the moluccas and a man came forward who spoke a few words of portuguese .	if
4	94319	She practically skidded to a halt .	She exited and came face to face with his body guards , all of whom were standing at attention outside her door .	when
0	64053	`` we were at a party and we started talking .	I bumped into him .	and
2	51761	Entry and fulfillment were .	Instead of thrusting , he reached down with his hands .	but
0	155048	All around them was joy merriment , and .	This man had kindly offered to let her be a part of that .	and
1	90274	I had accepted my heritage weeks .	Denying it didnt make it go .	because
0	30947	I do not mean to face the master one day .	Have to explain to him why we have been caught sleeping .	and
4	83959	Then assumed it was because of my sinful ways .	I fell ill many at my court .	when
0	133198	I 'm betting they flew over the peaks called that going into the rain forest .	They claim to be mining engineers who 've traveled to the andes countless times , but .	and
0	14750	Who could send his mind across the ocean .	Occupy the body of a man in a place called minoa .	and
0	100504	She threw her head back with a moan of ecstasy .	Let her pleasure unfold .	and
3	130118	And , you never really trust those people .	Even it seems to work .	if
3	120120	We 're not sure .	He was telling us that this attack was done by the cabbie killer , or if he was having flashbacks , or what .	if
0	75401	The royal family remained plagued by tradition , even more so once the prophecy was fulfilled .	The daughter of a king can not associate with a commoner of any status .	and
1	158859	She must have liked the kitties he 'd sent her .	She stared at them for a long time .	because
4	19555	How evil he was .	He 'd taken his own grandson 's life right in front of her .	when
2	121730	Why a bird was talking to him .	At that moment he didnt really care .	but
2	132194	Arcadia has landed on the coast .	Multiple sieges have failed .	but
2	55586	Her kids , susan and robbie , normal , well-behaved happy kids , ten and eight years old respectively , tried to take it in their stride .	Couldnt avoid the odd muuum .	but
0	97309	He found the degree of fear baffling ; but for the most part he was occupied in sleeping , and directing his frequent sneezes away from the ship .	Expressed some disappointment at never seeing the specter when so many others had evidently had a glimpse .	and
3	151967	We can sit back and relax for the rest of our lives .	We can all push through today .	if
4	111724	How can a family ever been satisfied .	A love one is killed by a drunk driver .	when
2	110852	`` now boy , you 're not too old for me to take you out behind the woodshed , '' joseph said .	There was obviously no oomph behind his words .	but
1	150109	But you probably knew that .	You know her names not kat .	because
0	85000	Stare , relent , turn around .	Trudge back out through the front doors of my my .	and
1	126734	His left wrist was twisted .	He had maintained his grip on the assault .	because
0	49066	I asked , folding my arms across my chest .	Trying to look slightly more intimidating than a jet-lagged , scruffy-faced musician .	and
3	9760	They would probably discover that alternative actions would lead to consequences that are just as bad or even worse .	Anyone could do that .	if
0	94705	Sparhawk nodded bleakly and touched his ring to the lid .	Took out the box .	and
0	117200	Both were dressed in colourless , woollen jerkins and cloaks .	Bore the facial scarring and tattoos of seasoned warriors .	and
2	18095	Im not sure i want to be an admiral .	I dont want to limit myself .	but
0	29680	Growling , sam opened his door .	Walked in before he could change his mind .	and
2	45627	Her warning was rational .	Clay was a bit beyond rational at this point .	but
2	154275	Oh , he makes good money alright .	No one ever accused him of being in his right mind .	but
0	29753	Tiearan would take gren and two of the older ones .	Teach them apart from the others .	and
0	41666	At nightfall they made a bed of ferns at the foot of a spreading beech .	Slept under its sheltering branches , protected from the misty autumn rain .	and
3	66964	Still , the portal would have to be bigger , and vincent out of .	He was going to get two big men like romulus .	if
4	143420	Scotty grabbed him by the collar with both hands and pinned him against the time clock .	Claude tried to pass him .	when
0	69640	He slid his other arm around korstens shoulders .	Rested his face lightly upon korstens hair .	and
0	81481	You may then conduct your business .	Having done so depart on your way .	and
4	149572	So we found him waiting in our dorm lobby , ready to go with us to breakfast .	She and i came downstairs for the second day .	when
4	54903	Probably a hundred shadows flew out of it .	I opened the shed .	when
4	125290	He nearly lost it .	Her lips closed around the head of his cock .	when
0	109260	You two take this guy .	Put him in his car .	and
0	47971	David pulled a face .	Sipped on his mint tea .	and
2	53568	No one had a decent explanation for what had killed those trees .	Spared the grove on the other side of the wall .	but
0	9000	At the mouth , it was mirrorlike .	He met his own worried gaze a dozen times over a dozen glances .	and
0	74490	Nowbefore i change my mind .	Return you to yeorathe .	and
3	158762	I 'll wait outside with the horses . '' .	I can get my own clothes .	if
3	96406	Then someone has to shoulder the extra weight .	I increase my personal responsibility .	if
0	106832	The ground rushed towards him .	He prayed that death would be instantaneous .	and
2	132773	The first day 's march was over frodo 's pain began to grow .	He did not speak of it for a long time .	but
3	72439	There should be a public paper trail .	We know what to look for .	if
0	71251	Eventually , the massive shock wave dissipates .	The wall of water rushes back in towards ground zero into the unprotected and burning city , sweeping the debris .	and
4	849	I began clapping and commended her .	She concluded the piano solo .	when
0	55231	A gesture , the crossbowmen dismounted , winched back their bowstrings with the help of hook and stirrup .	Plucked quarrels from their quivers .	and
0	58832	We were now enemies .	It was so much worse than .	and
3	63531	I mean i suppose i could make the time .	You want me there .	if
3	120008	I wanted more of it .	This was the dreamgiver 's version of blood .	if
2	74098	Language is just about conversation .	For children , it 's much more than that .	but
2	146184	Neither of them had the slightest idea as to who or what he was talking about , something he wanted all to himself .	Technologies meant something to alexander .	but
0	101393	Deciding there was nothing of interest up .	Assuming the heart of the code tower was likely to be the actual tower , she next tried the door to the left of the kitchen .	and
3	68297	Jenny is safe in the hands of her captors , of use to them .	Only she is alive .	if
3	99726	It would look strange .	I waited too much longer .	if
3	20541	How things could turn out .	Sensitive information fell into the wrong hands .	if
0	73732	The dog looked up at her .	Then slipped his head back under the hem of the robe once more .	and
0	44244	They had skirted the haci .	Reached the path beyond it .	and
1	108519	When you shot the security guard .	When i went in the safe was open and empty .	because
2	134774	The woman spoke english .	It was hard to understand her through her sobs .	but
1	98036	She would never marry a local man .	She viewed it as the equivalent of indentured servitude .	because
0	140234	When she reached the bottom , she had to turn a corner .	Then she found herself in the silver chalice .	and
0	97677	He was starting to feel like they were brother by .	He felt a precipitous hole open inside him to think that these people might soon cease to be a part of his life .	and
2	160691	It seared his hand .	In his fury he paid no heed .	but
0	57945	When bones grabbed juan .	Buried his fangs deeply into his neck .	and
4	33943	Onozawa caught up and pulled a three pronged sai from his belt .	They reached a clearing near a thin river draining .	when
2	77493	She may not have been as physically imposing as males were .	She was far quicker and far more cunning .	but
2	5033	I wondered if she thought we were doing a walk-through , something that would require actual physical exertion .	Then i realized that she was probably just used to showing off her spectacular actor 's body .	but
3	69509	Ah my dear flora , will enable you to do so , and all the fear of what made you so unwell will pass .	I could forget time .	if
2	6084	She was going to ask after him .	He spoke : your familys catholicism never took hold of you .	but
3	39866	Ask yourself this : who must he listen to and what does she want above all .	You wonder how to convince your prince to go to paris .	if
2	149036	He could not move .	Was stubborn enough to try .	but
0	73634	Danika rushed into the studio .	Lifted the second painting she 'd done from its place against the wall .	and
2	60629	I 'd been shocked at how far i let things go with him .	It had also seemed so easy to just let it happen .	but
2	40293	The tires slipped on the sand .	The truck drifted far enough forward to clear it , continuing in a two-hundred-and-eighty-degree turn .	but
1	87030	I never sold them .	They were the only piece of family i had left .	because
2	82982	That usual led to one conclusion .	I wanted to confirm it .	but
0	119613	I pulled mona off the road .	Got out of the car .	and
2	127786	Sure , he 'd already caused a strain in our relationship .	That would end it all .	but
0	7756	A child sees an obstacle .	His first thought is to run around it or knock it down .	and
4	9828	He would often start doing origami .	His mind was on other things .	when
0	122791	He turned onto my street .	I felt a wave of relief .	and
3	146274	I could devote much of the time i have to doing .	It would be possible to examine the items in my cottage instead of the basement .	if
3	26112	It could mean her life .	She made a mistake like that .	if
0	58773	Moonlight filtered down between the leaves of ivy .	Lucas was close enough that i could recognize his scent-something that reminded me of cedar and pine , like the woods that surrounded us , as if he were somehow a part of this dark place .	and
3	86702	Sure he could resist her .	She did a thing like that .	if
4	34636	Kristie pressed firmly on the gas and backed out , crushing two zombies who were staring stupidly at the suv .	The garage door was all the way up .	when
4	154205	He didnt expect theyd all end up staring at him , wanting him to give a speech .	Shane asked for a huddle .	when
2	131148	You , you are in the blood line of my ancestors and .	Have fulfilled a prophecy that i will not be left .	but
0	110111	Clary went last through the shining doorway , after the other four had stepped through .	She let the cold darkness take her like water pulling her down and under , stealing the breath from her lungs , making her forget everything but the clamor and the falling .	and
0	155134	Oh sure , they 're tall .	They have those cool fangs .	and
0	134129	I push away from the wall , step carefully over a sack of onions .	Follow the hedge priest into the kitchen .	and
3	101319	We 're not talking about very bright people .	I 'm reading svensson 's story .	if
0	125552	Ryan grabbed anastasias limp body .	They ran up the stairway , bounding out of the bedroom and down the hallway to the foyer .	and
0	33985	Rainer jumped from the bushes ran toward them .	When he saw them , he stopped , but .	and
2	13451	It begins like a gentle caress .	Soon turns into an insistent pressure as he wills me to open up .	but
0	7988	I get up from the bench .	Run for my car .	and
2	67583	Surfing well into the afternoon .	Vincent proved more of a distraction than a help-the pent up sexual energy i .	but
4	92230	Why do i feel like this .	I 've only been chatting to this guy for a little while .	when
3	103311	As well as decide .	We go at all .	if
2	49134	Normally she 'd be appalled over being the focus in a public setting .	She already loved these girls and she was having fun .	but
0	154055	He dropped to his knees .	Checked her neck and wrist for a pulse .	and
3	98037	He might have a shot .	He went over there and broke them up before things got too heated between them .	if
4	53467	The cop 's fingers had been covered in her blood .	He 'd first rushed to the hospital .	when
0	107515	He walked to the closest table .	Sat down , centering the plate in front of him .	and
4	147695	What you should have been doing .	She was in california .	when
3	8663	Why i suspect you could whoop that rascal . '' .	You had a mind to .	if
0	80282	Bethel needed no prompting .	Sank where he stood .	and
2	29828	Kevin jumps at the sound of clay 's voice .	Then immediately reaches down and swings the suitcase at clay .	but
0	114778	Anyway , the second micaen emperor took it one step further .	Sheathed the columns in the throne-room .	and
4	68662	We were more shocked than anyone .	Our feelings for each other changed in such a short amount of time .	when
0	126222	Drive her out of rayne . '' .	Break her foothold in reality .	and
2	42471	He was still very wan and washed-out from the effects of the cz-149 withdrawal .	He was no longer shivering .	but
2	62838	She fits right in with everyone at the capital .	At the same time , i 'm not sure she 's entirely sane .	but
2	62637	It was like the sensation of speaking while in the throes of a head cold one knows what words one is saying .	Can not hear them .	but
2	89104	Well , i am not supposed to be doing this , you know began the adventurous .	John saw that he started hesitating .	but
2	96892	The details are tedious . '' .	We have strong evidence that annias was behind it all .	but
2	56444	Beth was my best friend .	It was for her own good .	but
0	3686	How school was hard , and .	We were placing unreasonable demands on her .	and
1	60596	Getting this special treatment .	I have a jacuzzi .	because
4	101384	I even gave wodenhill a call from the hq , but he rudely told me that the investigation was currently going on , and i would be contacted .	I had a spare moment .	when
2	129061	A small gasp escapes me , it 's small .	Nico catches it and i can actually see the green in his eyes darken at my response .	but
2	1895	They 'd burned over her flesh .	Never actually hurt her .	but
3	58911	I 'll bust out the daisy duke 's and flip flops .	It 's a totally casual environment .	if
3	160784	Ill go and ask her .	She can spare you a few minutes and then ill bring her up .	if
4	132326	Many go back with their kind .	Its , will removed his hand and sat .	when
2	147063	Narasan and sorgan spent a great deal of time with veltan 's sketchy map of the ravine leading down to the village of lattash .	When they 'd shown it to the comical native red-beard , he 'd dismissed it as worthless because of its lack of detail .	but
4	27883	Staring , with zeke clutching my hand .	Trish picks up my tray and heads to throw it .	when
0	94677	I hit the button on the elevator .	Waited for it to make its long ascent .	and
3	9982	Im doing well round here and might before long need a chauffeur .	All goes according to my plans .	if
2	150942	She considered pushing him into the water .	Decided shed save her vengeance for .	but
4	78993	And , he 'd thrown the question back to me , like we were the same .	I 'd asked zev what he was .	when
2	46516	Ethan tried to still her shaking .	Julie was back on her feet , and she took his hands .	but
0	38535	Then she came to the roan mare with the big , poignant eyes , the long white blaze down her nose .	Knew without being told .	and
2	155570	They 'd decided to kill these hunters strider suddenly found himself regretting that choice .	Decided not to take any prisoners .	but
3	127853	I would be able to keep living .	I could find out what really happened to her .	if
2	86784	River thought shed been past feeling .	She felt it when jonathan bit her .	but
2	73912	All say you 're wonderful to work with .	You keep your private life to yourself .	but
0	36126	The pair they were hunting knew someone was after them , but they didnt know how many theyd face .	They didnt know they were being herded down onto the plain .	and
2	49362	Truth be told , theyll hold my status for up to six months .	Theres been some issues with my residency placement .	but
2	138619	With a brother like jamie , i had imagined her at least my height , or even taller .	The woman by the fire barely reached five feet .	but
0	89159	Kicking the sorceress 's ankles .	Sending her crashing to the ground .	and
1	75229	A new sorceress could bring a four-centuries-old vampire to his knees .	She was feeling agitated , what else could she do .	because
4	6960	The door was just closing behind me .	His voice carried down the hall .	when
3	138024	I 'll see , tell her what 's going on and find out if she knows anything about a tattoo . '' .	I can get in touch with her .	if
0	72447	You are a free man you have made no oath of service to the king .	I might counsel you against it , but : indeed , i am rather indebted to you , than the reverse .	and
2	156323	Your father did go to see them all those years .	I didnt want him to .	but
2	146602	She still loved peter too , despite the anger she felt towards him .	Following the days proceedings , she doubted that christmas would ever be the same .	but
0	145707	His free hand grabbed that arm , using his long , sharpened nails to restrain me .	Pushed it out of the way .	and
0	27816	You met his mother whilst out riding . '' .	Were smitten by her beauty .	and
4	82678	I was coming to meet you in hooghly , satyanand explained , that was .	The events took an ugly turn .	when
4	103383	Vampires can be pretty stone-faced .	They 're dealing with each other .	when
3	145927	Mrs. johnson a nurse will be by with some papers for you to sign .	Youll go out in the waiting room .	if
2	94266	She knew the dangers he was facing , and even fewer might suspect her future role with hussan .	Considered them to be minimal at the current time since not many people knew that she was even in the country .	but
4	94887	How ticklish i was .	He rubbed his five o'clock shadow on my neck or belly .	when
3	28917	Well go to that place you like with the peach cobbler .	You feel like it .	if
2	80731	Lightly boned still so tight they restricted breathing .	Stowed at one end , wrapped in gray polythene , were ball gowns , too small now , and corsets , ; eating was out of the question .	but
2	49826	Izzy has only been at mary evans for about two weeks . '' .	Has already proven herself awesome by permanently crippling ben mccrary .	but
0	33081	To overpower her with awe and fear .	Scorn her with his wrath .	and
2	21193	Binding gentry with even a little iron was usually enough to stunt their magic .	My human blood protected me .	but
0	15513	She quickly gathered up one stocking .	Slipped it over miriams toe .	and
3	23206	Just remember that i love you , and i will return .	You start to feel sad .	if
2	43655	`` i will ask you . '' .	I will not coerce you .	but
3	60186	Um , i wonder . '' .	She can read lips .	if
3	126662	I swear to god i 'm going to punch you ! '' .	You tell me one more time to breathe through the pain .	if
4	20250	Sometimes i go into the twilight zone ultra-violet sometimes i can see the bigger picture and get hunches that are almost always right these episodes are usually fleetingmost of the time .	My back is up against the wall .	when
2	114388	It 's got hands and a face .	... it 's upside-down , all angular .	but
3	14885	But i 've learned that marriage is sometimes even more challenging , and in this , my parents ' was no exception .	Raising children is difficult .	if
0	73438	Spinning on his grandmother .	Talking with his hands .	and
0	88235	What he 'd done so that he could go .	To beg forgiveness from them .	and
2	128169	Grimacing , id tried using my fork to cut open the meat .	That had been a no go .	but
0	19505	Guilt and hatred enthralled him , often only being seen during times of war .	Bound him to a solitary existence .	and
0	63353	We have been friends since we wore cradle-clothes leaves the path and enters the clearing . '' .	We 'll continue as friends until one of us .	and
3	86461	It would be traced and gildern and the ironheads would be discredited .	They paid the ransom money .	if
3	137587	Dont be stupid , girl , homer snarled the currents surely have .	The rocks havent killed him .	if
0	48197	We had another visitor .	She thought that you might be him .	and
0	558	He had lit torches .	Planted them on either side of the throne to frame him in the gathering darkness .	and
2	3095	`` it sounds stupid .	I have a purpose .	but
0	19792	Come on , she 's cute . '' .	This is the last night i get to watch you in action .	and
4	128969	I took the c2 bus to great portland street and then the tube to the institute for tropical diseases in bloomsbury .	It was time to get the vaccinations .	when
2	24365	Alec seems like he is going to ignore me ? '' .	Then he says , `` actually the question here should be what is up with you .	but
3	86852	I cant help it makes me horny .	Having a bunch of girls wanting to jump me .	if
0	30123	Before anyone knew it , i had grabbed little salome 's hand , and stepping over this person and that , and we were at the edge of the roof .	Tugged her away , slipping under this person and that .	and
4	75595	Feeling my arm slide through her fingers .	She tried to grab it .	when
2	72842	I tend to go toward lucky brand , which i know sounds funny considering that was cool in high school .	They 're super comfortable .	but
1	100844	I remember hating her the first time i met her , because words just dribbled out of her mouth unchecked , careless .	She was a candor .	because
3	107449	This is my evil plan , ' .	That 's what you 're thinking .	if
4	55360	He was adamant and aggressive .	He demanded to see you .	when
4	11884	It 's a sobering wake-up call . '' .	You realize just how close you come to losing someone or how easily they can slip .	when
2	21391	After that surge of excitement , i tried to watch television for a while .	The laugh tracks made my head ache .	but
3	57033	Though , you can carry my bags to my quarters for me .	You really want to thank me .	if
2	63757	Makes me feel so special . '' .	I 'm still not going .	but
0	61060	Shall i shoot him while you watch or shall i shoot you .	Then ram his arse until he begs me for a pair of laces .	and
0	4319	Something had freaked him out .	I wondered what it was .	and
0	45156	Without warning , a crash was heard from the living room window ... lauren had just crashed her own party .	The room was instantly filled with screams .	and
3	14641	The mystians have no hope and will forever be ruled by the pacts .	The pacts manage to kill you .	if
3	150664	We 're all going to the movies tonight -- . '' .	You wan na join .	if
3	153989	That probably only leaves us enough time for a movie .	You have to be home by nine .	if
1	84258	Depression is a sign of strength .	It means no matter how weak your mind might be to you , your heart is still strong enough to feel .	because
2	145854	`` with any luck , we 'll get them before they know we 're .	If not , they 'll likely head for the back door .	but
0	29022	Her eyes glued on the road .	The dial edged over ninety-eight , ninety-nine .	and
2	37586	I was already wet .	Within half a block , i 'm even more thoroughly drenched .	but
2	151530	He puts the back of his hand against my cheek for one millisecond .	When he pulls away i can feel the outline of his hand , like it 's scalded me .	but
2	145469	Not to hate ellie or derek .	To accept things-even if it meant seeing them come together as a couple-and move on .	but
3	94920	I might kill you . '' .	You told anybody what i 'm about to tell you .	if
4	31643	He would cast her .	She was no longer of any use to him .	when
0	99693	Thutmose leaned in toward john .	Placed a hand on his arm .	and
0	45783	Jack reached out in the darkness and , giving it a tug , a hissing sound filled the air as he pressed the door outward .	Felt for the handle upon the vault door .	and
1	56114	How many trips might be required .	The least important factor was ray 's fatigue .	because
0	111662	This man was a doctor had a lifelong interest in medicine , ed decided to answer .	Normally someone asked him about his past he would refuse , but .	and
4	42596	He 'd made headlines in the vegas press .	He opened the archer 's arrow casino a month .	when
4	51678	Thinking of the want in the womans eyes .	She was saying she didnt want george at all .	when
0	52869	Why dont you sit down .	Relax for a moment .	and
0	127601	It was a pipedream full of bad morals worse behavior , and .	If i left , i left without their blessing .	and
0	89632	Come to a neutral place , i would say .	Then in the night we would rise up and kill them all .	and
4	97566	I let kissy walk off into the jungle with alys to make her plea .	We returned to camp .	when
0	151835	Some will be without family here at kitloch .	Can be taken to the caverns at burick lake or genilox .	and
2	22081	The man was insatiable .	Since being with him , she had discovered that she was pretty insatiable .	but
4	151811	He accidentally hit upon a sore spot in her psyche .	She was giving him his riding lesson .	when
0	150513	Have an answer by the time they reached the hospital .	They wheeled her back to an examining room .	and
3	98920	Number one is still head down so i 'm comfortable with proceeding with a vaginal delivery . '' .	You 're still on board with that .	if
2	117491	Who had mined those incredible blocks , and ; it was thought best not to trouble that quarry , around which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling .	Whither they had been transported , no woman might say .	but
0	77428	Amira glanced up at dardan .	Raised her eyebrows in question .	and
3	32475	We 'll all see the inside of a tolnedran dungeon . '' .	We 're caught with an imperial princess in our company .	if
0	96036	He threw the wineglass .	She 'd had her first dream .	and
0	13279	She had odd eyes , not quite any color .	They looked a little empty .	and
2	148807	There were no native mammals in vesper .	Rodents had come ashore with their unwitting human chauffeurs .	but
3	145929	As you are to me , that would spoil your generosity : it would no longer be as great as it is .	I were as kind to you .	if
0	113821	Sunshine moved him to the futon , then she crawled slowly up his body , and straddled his hips .	Pushed him back into a reclining position .	and
0	13802	I simply show up .	Announce my willingness to help .	and
4	70621	She worked out the woman 's identity .	She recognized the man .	when
4	28558	But that will only come . '' .	We think you need to reflect or rest .	when
2	28051	She asked , as sweet as ever , nor for any of us or what we wanted .	I knew now she didnt care for me at all .	but
0	4982	Time was running out .	He could think of nothing useful to do .	and
0	52337	When the world ends .	Everyone here is dead .	and
2	113271	It 's not going to be easy to hear . ' .	I need you to listen ... to all of it .	but
2	63470	`` mayhap , '' evelinde said quietly , then pointed out , `` .	He left the room just ere me to go below that day .	but
0	107107	It looked at the ground , studying the marks of the mornings eating .	Justin silently prayed his sneaker prints would go unnoticed .	and
4	35952	I want to talk to a witch . '' .	I see evidence of witchcraft .	when
4	33410	I felt the first sobs tear through my chest .	I opened my eyes .	when
4	26686	He could almost smell the dust of all those unexplored ruins , waiting for someone to uncover their secrets .	He walked this close to the fence .	when
0	55879	Six walks over to the markings .	Drags the toe of her shoe under the number eight .	and
2	131441	I 've tried speaking to dervish .	What can i say .	but
3	104836	It was up to him , not me .	The little cherub wanted to teach his kid the birds and the bees .	if
2	136923	He stood tall and muscular , larger even than mikael , in a black sleeveless shirt , and lyght couldnt help .	Notice the massive sword slung on his back .	but
0	41908	A few seconds later and three miles away , two trucks exploded as missiles from the drone .	Lit up the surrounding desert .	and
2	141218	What she wants is a slice of chocolate mousse cake .	She settles on a small piece of godiva chocolate .	but
0	49313	The man looks powerfully indignant .	Snorts as he walks .	and
0	101194	He knew she 'd be .	His spies had probably told him she was .	and
0	27401	I walked three blocks in the drizzling rain , cut through twice as many alleys .	Doubled back five times before i was positive no one was following me .	and
0	70986	After a while of our water antics , i was feeling much more comfortable in the water .	We were having the best time .	and
4	35931	Who had taken care of me .	I had first arrived at walter reed .	when
0	70946	He almost falls to the ground .	Can not stand unaided .	and
0	102819	He hauled himself up .	Went to the front desk .	and
4	78460	I repeated the question , `` ? '' .	Exactly did you order the food .	when
0	84253	It 's aimed at torak . ' .	It 's not going to hit him for about three thousand years .	and
0	84638	When we tucked our tails between our legs .	Hid out in the woods .	and
0	9657	The lions coach grabbed his arm roughly said , no way .	He started to go into a stall , but .	and
2	10996	The man had been a knight and they called him mister .	Was now a duke and a commander .	but
3	101464	I wondered ; i slept so deeply that upon waking i had several moments of complete amnesia .	My jumbled memory had something to do with russ feeding me his strength .	if
2	142546	The going was harder .	He soon reached the edge of the clearing .	but
0	8014	You were a dirty cop .	Were investigating one of your own crimes what would you do .	and
0	151153	He does what he is supposed to do .	He does it well , auron told genie .	and
1	36933	All of that 's .	You have some mysterious genetic make-up that has regenerated your body on its own .	because
0	136367	We make a good team on the battlefield .	Have a chemistry that only family could have .	and
2	108180	Not an i 'm sorry kiss , or a deep , heart-searing , mind-melding lip-lock that took my breath .	Let 's just be friends kiss .	but
0	22824	I take up the shovel .	Walk past him while nev nuzzles into my neck .	and
2	33021	She screamed , true .	Mostly the pain was excruciating .	but
3	13027	Youll find the kitchen and the bathroom .	You go through that door .	if
4	50292	Looked under the mattress , checked the cabinets . '' .	You went through my drawers .	when
0	99576	The smaller one was silver in colour .	Across its surface ran hundreds of what looked like tiny orange-coloured cracks , which gave the impression it was made of glass and could shatter at any moment into a thousand pieces .	and
2	18249	The reason of shortened height of lamppost was not its pole .	It was a five-six feet deep pit which had been dug in the ground .	but
4	25933	I see she has a foot keeping the door from swinging closed .	I 'm standing right behind her .	when
2	160393	It was too dark to see the carving on the plaque within the shrine .	His exploring fingers made out a roman numeral-ii , he thought it was .	but
2	69328	Leo did get a mention as one of the children of adolfo .	His siblings were the ones that found notoriety with the family business .	but
0	151984	They were all going the same way .	It had been a long way .	and
2	118009	She may have looked to be around sixty years old .	She was spry for her age as she began chasing us down the hall .	but
0	1061	Slowly she opened her eyes .	Let them adjust to the dimly lit stucco room .	and
2	143376	It was the best idea in the world .	It is what i was left with in the moment .	but
2	160619	She has people working for her she trusts .	She never stays away this long without popping in for a visit .	but
2	158739	Arlen did not seem to hear her , and .	Alice desperately flung her arm through the splintered door as if she could somehow reach it herself .	but
0	31089	I wandered to the student center .	Aimlessly scanned the boards for anything remotely entertaining that i could do with myself for a few hours .	and
2	67402	So far the exercise had done nothing and make him sweaty .	Cover him in mud .	but
0	23307	Sparhawk reached inside his doublet .	Took out the unadorned gold box .	and
4	80855	It shot forward with surprising force , pushing john back against his seat .	The pilot released the brakes and advanced the levers .	when
3	109647	We have someone who can put in the shunt , and we 'll do our best to protect you in the field . '' .	You decide you want to give up science altogether and learn to pilot .	if
2	79018	`` he 's got spirit , '' i said .	As soon as the words left my mouth , mike spun a really wicked roundhouse kick into jason 's chest , which he blocked , only to receive a straight-cut jab to the skull that would 've lobotomised a human .	but
2	71725	Much to my surprise , he did .	Then again , hed been waving the light all over .	but
3	10551	You have no powers , jedzia insisted , coming to stand beside of annalise .	You are a fallen .	if
3	69064	I would always be rough .	You 're with me .	if
2	133014	We lost a few .	They lost a lot .	but
4	154652	She got off him , and rifled through his pockets .	The body was finally motionless .	when
3	25932	I tell you , donald then we would know a great deal more than we do now . '' .	We knew what horatio knows .	if
4	55169	I shined my flashlight all over the platform , underneath the track and into the large pit below .	We got to the top .	when
4	135356	That was , the weapons , the fight .	I lost myself to the moment .	when
4	105558	They 're right , '' harper said .	Teddy opened his mouth to protest .	when
3	93197	Id think she did it on purpose .	I didnt know any better .	if
4	155652	She shut the computer down and popped out her thumb drive .	The file transfer finished .	when
0	39288	We sat in a booth ate and talked about normal , real-world things .	Nothing fancy but not fast food , either , and .	and
0	123590	Adam needs the help .	Hoel will appreciate it if he improves .	and
1	44286	Instead he killed landon .	He said he saw in my eyes that raven meant a lot to me .	because
2	55004	Probably was at least he 'd thought to have an infant 's car seat included .	It looked brand-new and .	but
4	50624	She shuddered and could not still her limbs .	She heard the voice of glaurung her heart died within her .	when
0	153956	She could have twisted ended her pain .	Pitched one of the many daggers strapped to her .	and
1	50225	He left the rest unsaid .	It was apparent what he meant .	because
3	65459	They have the juice to get a good actress .	We get clooney and soderberg .	if
3	70693	Then you must be very honorable .	He spared your life .	if
2	32811	It attempted to climb a few buildings along the way .	It only gripped them for a few seconds before dropping and crawling after its nemesis .	but
2	37933	That she 'd not been fond of .	Now seemed particularly appealing .	but
0	72263	Easy does it on the way to the compound , the guard cautioned .	Then murmured into his radio , his eyes darting from the crates to the tense faces of his peers .	and
0	83198	Anna shook her head .	Pressed on for one more lap around the lounge .	and
2	31853	Everyone started pushing and shoving when they felt it happening .	I was more focused on plastering one hand on the railing and the other to my cousins arm .	but
2	102053	He reached down , pulling at one of them , and he suddenly wished he had a weapon to cut them with .	They resisted him , remaining securely fastened to his body .	but
4	127304	I left that part out . '' .	I told you about my youth .	when
0	100579	Apart from our own existentialism and so our motivations for travel pertain to the egotistical needs of the individual self making for a colourful array of weird and wonderful outbursts of human behaviour which are generally only momentarily and physically significant , even to us .	The products and consequential damage of these behaviours will die with us as a matter of course .	and
4	127192	He risked his life to rescue her .	He found out that i had a sister .	when
4	160781	Why i agreed with you last week .	You said you thought the state should have put you to death .	when
2	141467	I was almost able to prevent him from taking over the master 's chair . '' .	Unfortunately , things went wrong .	but
4	20621	`` hideous enough i 'll let you know . '' .	I conceive of something .	when
4	111553	He could be so patronizing , a hot meal .	He 'd always had a nice place to live .	when
2	108123	Floa regarded him with contempt .	It was celestias heated gaze that made her speak .	but
0	86169	Still aneeku stared at the jar in silence .	Seemed hesitant to take it .	and
2	58684	I raise my hand to try to touch his face , to get him to look up at me .	My hand goes right through him .	but
2	151717	I 'm terrified . '' .	Knowing i have you guys makes it a little easier .	but
0	134045	It would be expensive , of course ; just enough to start over .	Only a few people could be saved .	and
2	133779	Something moved beside him .	He didnt have the energy to turn and see what it was .	but
0	31475	Paul gave me a shoulder-hug .	Then nancy hugged me .	and
4	1998	You would have turned over the samples .	Either you were caught or to frank when he was preparing your case or even when we returned with dr. schneider .	when
0	132068	Two fell inside the lifeboat , instantly slowing them and causing them to turn .	Pulled tight against the side .	and
2	42520	Preston almost let the subject go .	Even then , vince 's strange response had made him curious .	but
3	56038	Maybe ill tell you .	More you promise to visit me more .	if
3	19433	You can show them off at the fly-in .	You want as long as they dont get scratched .	if
4	18141	I climbed the rest of the way , scrambling over the lip of the well to land in some grass .	The burn in my biceps subsided .	when
2	123007	Those don appear like anythin ive even seen on our military , and i really do not even remember who i am at the moment .	Whatta ya doin out here in the middle of nowhere town with no vehicle , no water or no food or jhahnahkan interrupted rex , i wish i could give you more information .	but
0	26063	Meg rushed into the bathroom opened the silver razor .	Sat on the closed toilet seat .	and
4	19903	His chains brought him up .	He tried to lift his arms .	when
0	47865	`` your daddy came in here this morning .	Withdrew four thousand , four hundred and fifty dollars from your account .	and
2	38779	No way in hell mackenzie was going to repeat what hed said .	Shortstop gave a little snigger and she closed her eyes .	but
0	133641	He left the trader walking at a brisk pace through the crowded markets thought it might be sensible to arm himself in a country as inhospitable as northern sindabar - nor did he want either himself or jaim to look too easy as targets the further north they travelled .	Led the horse that was smaller than the two they already had .	and
2	60754	I wanted to argue with him .	Found that i could n't . .	but
4	117485	I got a very good look at your face .	I felt the power begin to surge .	when
2	63326	Man is receptive to the gifts given .	Does not understand them .	but
3	16475	I will walk out of here right now and you wont hear another word from me .	You know anything about this .	if
0	95754	Her former mate had reached the same conclusion .	Was angry enough to spit glass .	and
0	15947	When i lifted my head .	Looked once more into the mist across the water .	and
0	10663	Many of them losing a counterpart to evil ways .	The fallen throughout the years .	and
0	31739	Carter clenched his jaw .	Threw the wrench into his tool box instead of his employee 's face .	and
1	3969	He clutched the second orb so that he would not fall .	His legs gave out .	because
2	82346	It was too dark to run flat out the way i wanted .	I kept up a steady jog .	but
4	50997	There was an energy surplus .	Nickel and gold were transmuted to rhodium .	when
4	155282	Mendigo had put kendra and her family in grave danger .	He had worked for muriel .	when
4	128295	Dad was at his desk .	I opened the door , doing what al british people do when they 're freaked out : drinking tea .	when
2	130441	Now hold on a minute , i dont know how he got my name in the first place .	He gave me a contact which i checked with my boss , and he agreed to see hendricks .	but
0	144834	`` look , i can go over there maybe once a week after hogswatch .	Show her some of the basic stuff .	and
4	12363	Almost like a sport or a hobby .	All jake felt was a stiffness creeping into his back from standing around in female clothing departments .	when
4	146548	She finished her toilette and started working on her watercolors while she waited for breakfast to arrive .	Rebecca awoke the next morning .	when
0	12468	Luthvian grabbed a vase from a side table .	Flung it at his head .	and
4	59484	She only has visions .	Something pivotal in our world happens .	when
3	101174	I would have arrested him .	You 'd made a complaint .	if
3	150569	There were probably a million or more people crammed into three levels of the station .	The evacuation sweeps had been even moderately successful .	if
3	142186	Then shoot me , she says , challenging him with an instinctive boldness .	You 're gon na shoot me .	if
0	98894	Striking a pose , he rested his arm on his leg .	Gazed intent at marcy .	and
2	137306	I had some plain oatmeal for breakfast around five .	I havent had anything since .	but
2	9640	They were all hideous , of course .	That was to be expected .	but
4	117824	He was halfway down the stairs .	He saw con walking through the entryway toward the front door .	when
0	24867	At that time leutenant amikam came to a visit .	The recruits demanded him to replace the fallafel ex-seller , who became sick due to the bad weather .	and
4	110394	Me and sanchez were responding to a shooting at the wonderland ballroom last night .	We spotted you scurrying across the desert .	when
4	112059	Where the fancy folks go .	They want to get wild .	when
0	42016	Then she turned it .	Held it up for jasnah .	and
3	149049	When he heard the victims were normal people - it would have made life much easier .	They 'd been vampires .	if
0	138579	Who did the same and i set the cup i still held .	Started to get to my feet .	and
0	49765	Then i left tor and my rooms .	Wandered down the wide hall toward the stairs .	and
2	57533	He reaches for me .	I move out of his grasp and round the breakfast bar to put space between us .	but
0	12854	His eyes come up to meet mine .	There is no humor in them .	and
0	65956	It was true that his relatives were slaughtered in the aftermath of failed coup dtat .	The rest of his family just barely escaped the unforgiving blade of death in the nick of time , why would he still retain rogath in himself .	and
2	51735	I talked to the school and if you attend school this year , you can be transferred to his school next year .	There isnt any possible way for you to be admitted at coles school .	but
2	102871	I froze for a moment , and jumped out of the way just in time .	I knew what happened to anyone in its path .	but
2	123759	I tried to rest .	My mind kept spinning with questions .	but
4	127637	He moves away from the railing and leans forward across the table , resting his elbows in front of him as he begins to text .	He sees that they 're still occupied .	when
0	60748	I was not even seventeen .	Already i had to be thinking about marriage .	and
4	91273	The metamorphosis was complete .	He turned back to his friend at last .	when
2	77803	I felt sadness for all of them .	I knew they would find some sort of peace in time .	but
0	17802	Selma swung her legs off the coffee table .	Walked into her office to gather her purse .	and
2	124657	It could have been extreme hunger .	The look on cade 's face had her impossibly curious .	but
4	112023	He reached for his helmet .	His breathing returned to normal .	when
0	123933	The swords were warrior-big .	Because parisa had much smaller hands than even most militia warriors , the sword seemed disproportionate .	and
1	11512	Luna was grateful for that departed were 's tactless behavior .	It had allowed luna to live in a place that had felt like home from the moment she 'd arrived .	because
3	130007	I would never see him .	I let him leave .	if
1	18751	Elliot was leading the group .	Munro had gone back to help one of the porters with his pack .	because
2	37782	I 'm sorry . '' .	All i can offer you is .	but
2	146430	I 'd blame the dementia .	He 's had this little quirk for as long as i can remember .	but
0	160081	Was sitting on the arm of my chair .	She was crazy about me and that we were a couple .	and
4	20251	She would leave in the household .	She left this world .	when
3	132143	We will blast this door open .	You do not come out .	if
2	141913	Davie , the kid in the adult body , takes a little while to work things out .	He usually gets there in the end .	but
3	148341	I 'd kick his ass .	He flirted with her .	if
2	19710	I nestled right into the fabric , not caring an inch about the itchiness of the wool .	Letting the blissful warmth of it finally touch against my frigid skin .	but
2	14037	I know she is . '' .	I 'm sure she 's ready to return to her home and try to find a way past what she 's been through .	but
3	121399	Said sunny , her arms folded , watching emma walk .	She cant put up with a couple of people fooling around she isnt worth it .	if
2	90645	The man put a quizzical look on his face .	After chris did it a few more times , he seemed to get it .	but
2	76568	Deadly force indeed , i could blow you from the sky .	You are my people , you are american , i will serve you , but i will never hurt you .	but
2	97988	As sally once told shawn were like comets passing in the heavens , close and fascinating .	We will never collide .	but
0	12234	Cole staggered to his feet then helped me up .	Looked at the railroad tie .	and
0	97455	Smile lit up her entire face .	Made her ... beautiful .	and
0	30783	He stilled , his expression blank .	She knew where some of those wounds had come from .	and
0	152963	Everyone was accounted for except roman .	I had no way to reach him .	and
3	75772	The sound was much you might hear .	You dropped a hot pinhead into a bucket of cold water .	if
0	144390	He splayed his hand over the image .	She saw the tears in his eyes .	and
3	13733	Know a good pitch .	It was sitting on his face .	if
1	150499	We didnt really discuss it .	She had an emergency at one of her properties .	because
0	119391	Nomi continued walking around the rock .	Tried to peer into the city .	and
0	44101	That i 'd let him finish his thought .	Tell me what i `` seem '' like .	and
4	61233	Back i used to find peace there , between the orderly white lines etched into the forest green rectangles .	The school was mine .	when
2	1160	He 's not scheduled to work today .	Somehow being surrounded by the hustle of morning chaos and grumbling employees is more comforting than the silence of his room .	but
2	88100	Ryan saw it and he held up a hand in the direction of ralph , marianne , and vanessa .	Feared for his life .	but
2	48886	She searched within herself for the sense of their presence .	Her body was hollow , empty .	but
0	105441	The air was thick warm , and .	Both ifferon and yavn were .	and
3	132067	Then some sort of message had been left with sharpe .	The killer had left trace 's dog tags with parker .	if
0	20881	Esther and her family would return back to holland .	Then he would find her .	and
1	78632	Adam had two guys that time so he always fights multiple , to keep it fair .	There isnt a single guy in this place that is matched to him strength-wise .	because
4	146544	Which turned to awe .	She realized who he was .	when
1	129175	If you 're going somewhere with this , maybe you should share . '' .	You 've lost me .	because
0	80442	He pitched the bag in the trash .	Wondered if cara was worth this kind of aggravation .	and
0	9052	So i will stay another day or two .	Think on other possible plans .	and
0	38948	The walls were white unadorned , and .	A charcoal brazier glowed in one corner .	and
0	3691	Tar raised his eyebrows .	Looked down his nose .	and
0	145955	She returned to the house for a shovel .	Then began digging a grave in a copse of trees .	and
0	11067	Sprinted cross the courtyard ; it wasnt long before the guards had caught me in their sights .	Found a place to hide .	and
0	92979	She stared at herself .	Studied her glum reflection .	and
4	17815	I wish i could lose my memory , '' yvonne had said .	Jennifer confessed how strange she had felt on waking up in the hospital .	when
0	13846	To test out a theory .	Play my own games .	and
0	13280	At the sound of sissy 's voice , jim grabbed the covers .	Yanked them over his crotch .	and
2	41911	He had no idea .	He meant to find out.carune still had almost forty minutes before comlink pulled the data base out from under him .	but
0	36892	That rose from the water .	Extended thick hands as if to ward off the mist .	and
2	16313	`` fellow workers , '' she said , `` i 'm sure there will be appropriate ceremonies at some reasonable time to mark this fantastic voyage of ours .	Please , we are in no condition to join you .	but
2	41444	I guess , her mocking me was fun for her and .	Dont tell her i said this , i really didnt mind it and , also dont tell her this , she was actually really a blast to be .	but
0	4633	Getting out , she snagged a fluffy white towel off the counter .	Winced as it came in contact with her skin .	and
0	77167	Havi loved that mermaid routine .	Kept having her do it over and over .	and
4	144678	Wearing wax fangs for halloween .	I was eight flitted through me .	when
2	102682	It was on one of the council estates at the back of the town .	It would be very hard to keep up mortgage payments on a private house if you spent half of your time in prison .	but
3	57066	I would be climbing a lot of stairs for nothing .	I was in the wrong building .	if
4	150351	Watching some young guys scooter around the library steps .	Chris turns to me .	when
4	22158	She was stunned with confusion .	She realized the prince had risen and given an order to the gray-eyed lord to bring beauty after him .	when
2	35089	What is going on .	I swear to you diana .	but
4	137506	It is called wind-month for wind-month .	The fishermen drew their boats ashore and give up fishing until next spring breathe .	when
2	56732	She jumped out of the way .	Not a flame sizzled over her coat , burning fabric and probably blistering her delicate skin .	but
0	54913	Amma was barely five feet tall a hundred pounds , but .	There was nothing frail about her .	and
3	7905	I have no doubt .	Your dad could have found happiness without hurting you .	if
0	153628	She yells , towards the lecture hall .	We run , hunched over .	and
4	62247	I saw bones sway a tad on his feet .	Last he lifted his mouth .	when
3	94346	Him way more apprehensive .	He were just planning to kiss me .	if
0	158869	She 'd tried to ditch him .	In typical zane style , he 'd come through to save her butt .	and
2	62529	The wolf in me was having a damn fine time , and i heaved a silent sigh of relief .	The woman was getting a little pissed he finally led me back to the table .	but
4	78246	`` not so amazing ... '' `` but .	You think that universes have started with less .	when
0	10527	Smoke and dust rose .	Filled the air so thickly that the forest soon became completely hidden from view .	and
0	17622	He closed his eyes .	Fumbled one huge hand under her skirt .	and
2	33428	I could take it up .	The suite is only used .	but
4	134697	He risked a look behind him .	He reached the back gate to the stables .	when
1	33728	Only his son survived .	He was hidden by women in the keep .	because
4	94659	We sent a second team .	We had heard nothing by four oclock this morning .	when
2	1483	Yes i can fit six of my holes into one of yours ... but .	Then he suddenly lost interest in the conversation as a peculiar odor flooded his sensitive nose .	but
3	124847	Kip couldnt afford to be .	Even the beagle was wrong .	if
1	71771	So i asked her to stop doing that .	It just reminded me of lucah .	because
1	49209	It 's not all ending .	Just you 're getting off the bus .	because
2	611	He said the house was a little way off the road , in a clearing , and it should have gotten sun at least five hours a day in the summer .	It somehow ... did n't . .	but
0	61268	I turned around kissed her so passionately that we were both breathing heavily when i finally released her .	Pulled her into me .	and
2	80312	This is an odd thought , for some inexplicable reason .	Were here drinking and with that word .	but
4	93973	Her wide eyes only closed .	His lips closed around hers .	when
4	90107	Especially considering the way he 'd practically been trying to force her out the door before their walk on the beach .	He 'd been an apple and she 'd been an orange .	when
3	1742	He 's automatically elevated up the ranks .	The other princes agree .	if
2	35016	Yeah , he still loved her .	He 'd given her more than enough time to figure out her own feelings for him .	but
3	47278	However , although i have often written to you about the essentially pragmatic nature of truth , i would not be disappointed , and perhaps even pleased .	You found such a lie too much of an affront to your integrity .	if
4	51233	He hesitated for the briefest moment .	He saw the two posts with the leather straps secured at the base and top .	when
2	140026	I 'm not technically old enough to drink .	I wear so much makeup that bartenders rarely card me .	but
2	3589	Erin and kota looked at each other .	Both could see that the other had no idea what to make of it .	but
2	93059	He was your friend , too , and he 's gone .	He was the man i loved .	but
2	99482	It would be a dishonorable act , to say the least .	As you have already discerned , face is not comprised of always doing the right thing .	but
3	44059	It will not be long before we are home .	The beloved nephew does not interfere any more in the darksends operations .	if
2	112279	It was several miles back up the river .	He was sure lozan would be sending out a party to search for them .	but
0	123704	It was irresponsible of him .	He should avoid every contact , which could bring him only pain and suffering for centuries .	and
3	52735	`` this is weird , '' he said .	Those three words summed up everything .	if
2	92659	Arrived at my apartment .	He made no attempt to come .	but
0	75611	The volk will be discovered .	That will close this door .	and
4	123244	I got up , put a hand on jamie 's shoulder in token of good night , and crawled into my blankets .	They lapsed into gaelic .	when
2	153906	They worked together-which , granted , seemed to be how everyone at danvers found a mate .	He tried damn hard never to complicate his life to that degree .	but
2	98923	I might 've been in a little doubt before this afternoon .	When you flung yourself in front of a pistol , it did rather clarify things .	but
0	147920	Who she was , to be buzzed in downstairs .	When she walked into reception grahame coats was already waiting for her .	and
2	130797	Its lack of purity means that it is rarely used in specific rituals .	It is considered a good conductor of magic .	but
2	136798	He wanted to say something .	The increasing smoke made breathing hard and speaking nearly impossible .	but
4	82712	She came to me . '' .	Even he was home .	when
4	7379	She would have liked .	Frances was doing so little to defend herself .	when
2	137529	I knew i should stay quiet , force him to speak .	My curiosity was too great .	but
0	130524	Briec shifted to dragon with a thought , barking her name .	Stormed through his cave looking for her .	and
2	132282	He was still muttering .	His tone had changed .	but
4	134767	To go with the vehicles .	The police team had arrived .	when
0	151050	When bracken and warren returned , everyone got into the suv and the sedan .	Drove to the location marked on patton 's map .	and
3	50489	And we have to act .	We have to do something .	if
4	44953	I was walking out of the shop .	I almost plowed over the tiny brunette that had been checking me out the last time i was .	when
1	4108	What and i 'll probably always take her back .	In this lonely world , she 's the only person who gets what it 's like to feel out of place .	because
3	101868	It was best for everyone .	I lied to her .	if
2	50924	`` oh , you know , visiting . '' .	It may be permanent .	but
3	120777	It is out of no failure of your own .	That is the case .	if
0	4154	The girls in the group sided with stephanie .	Because katie and brandon are still together , brandon followed them .	and
2	39555	Xaro was not himself of the pureborn .	He had told her whom to bribe and how much to offer .	but
0	41564	I killed a thousand wildlings scattered the rest , but we both know they will return .	Took another thousand captive .	and
4	67005	Had just finished revising a chapter in her book .	A long black limo pulled into tony 's driveway .	when
0	112701	I stood by the bed .	Eased the little white lacey things off .	and
2	35246	The servant carried their food in , bringing with him the scent of beef and potatoes .	She was no longer hungry .	but
2	52918	He shifted his gaze so that he was looking directly at the groom .	Derek was still engrossed in his phone call and either did not notice or did not choose to interrupt his long distance exchange for the more local one .	but
4	19715	Gardener could see the sling dangling against the side of the cut about twelve feet down c the cable rose and pushed the black button .	The motor had died c leaning over .	when
2	63994	He 's at least as tall as pete , and he 's ... different .	He 's covered in tattoos just like pete is .	but
0	151644	Let me out . '' .	I 'll help you .	and
4	14350	Why look for the 4th .	Xavier and the two other seekers are still going to have the upper hand .	when
0	110403	You overexcited , araminta .	You are quite overexcited enough as it is. .	and
0	83359	The troll-gods realized fairly early on that they were badly overmatched .	They went into hiding .	and
0	121031	The wookiee growled out a long response .	Han raised his hands in mock surrender .	and
0	160451	To keep us both busy , i dipped a cloth in a bowl of water .	Told nance to do the same .	and
2	27704	It should have promised a welcome rain after a long summer .	The smell of blood marred it .	but
2	32033	The general stopped to glance at him .	Quickly turned back to walking from one end of the roof and impatiently back to the other .	but
0	97878	Griffin has gone looking .	He says that lissa placed shala and elthine 's applications in the pile not to be considered .	and
3	157220	He would have no trouble firing at the traitor .	He got to his beretta .	if
4	84918	`` tell me again . '' .	You 're better and i 'll believe you .	when
4	104511	It was at the front of her mind .	She tried to put a name to this miracle .	when
4	97359	Startled at the sound .	Her mind was working a mile a minute to figure out what to do .	when
3	116230	Then they do not like for there to be ambivalence .	They can not be free .	if
3	158850	Once we make it to the illuminated bsunroom , gram asks .	She can be alone for the afternoon with him .	if
2	137153	Gnat shrieked in fright as she covered up her head even more .	The others remained stalwart in appearance , though they trembled .	but
4	72279	His sun-licked hands had made her own skin look as pale as milk .	He put his arms around her .	when
3	133268	You will see that the same eternal truth about the development of the soul in a body , about its numerous reincarnations in achievement of perfection , can be traced .	You read ancient scriptures of different religions .	if
2	150153	Kadan was blocking a good deal of the energy , and she recognized that ryland was a psychic talent .	He was allowing enough to slip through .	but
0	63030	I bring my fingers up to his face to touch the features i 've memorized down to the placement of each molecule .	A warm trickle of liquid greets me .	and
2	56819	I thought henry would place safety above time .	We were not late and i rolled the windows down to feel the chilly breeze .	but
2	89613	That would be the end of it .	Hed get up and leave and .	but
3	112106	I was musing . '' .	Your case is genetic .	if
1	26772	The air was neither stale nor damp .	I had left the door open whenever i worked .	because
4	57501	It appeared as big surprise .	Our pilot mentioned our unknown exact destination .	when
2	25758	Not only am i married to a psycho hes an old man with one foot inside the grave , and he just wont ever die .	Stuck with his weird magic ring .	but
0	25786	Quickly the little girl scurried to a cabinet .	Pulled out a worn book .	and
2	99360	Normal trips to the court 's location on the edge of the pocono mountains usually relied on puddle jumper planes to a rural airport thirty minutes .	Those flights were infrequent , hence the car .	but
2	32260	Yes , joe bob is dead .	Do you really want to throw that all .	but
0	133693	He squared his shoulders .	Looked down his nose at ryland .	and
0	84896	Aqua stared at it .	Went over to touch it with her hand .	and
2	153781	She needed to feed , even more than she needed proper sleep .	Neither of those was happening .	but
4	119278	She winced as she brought her arm up , and it took several tries until she was finally able to wrench it from her head .	She started to peel her turtleneck off .	when
2	131256	It was a huge heavy thing that must presumably have been made of wood .	Felt more like lead .	but
0	55358	Lord renald and lady gloria straithwaite were distant cousins of lady .	Every year they displayed the substantial musical talents of their four daughters at a performance carefully choreographed to show them at their finest .	and
3	72664	He could sort through all this and make some sense of her behavior .	His head didnt hurt .	if
2	104896	My naked back faced the lens .	Laurel faced ethan over my shoulder .	but
1	108335	Obviously , coop had filled his brother in at some point about the whole glitter prank .	Even his eyes are shining despite the small smile playing his lips .	because
3	150869	Leave a second time .	Not i can stop it .	if
2	83682	She tried to break away from him .	He moved in a flash .	but
4	75605	He added , `` one word , and i 'm driving away . '' .	She opened her mouth to argue .	when
1	111096	It was so much more dangerous .	It made her feel almost normal .	because
0	40198	Simmering anger boiled up in giorgios gut .	Threatened to spill out to his tongue .	and
0	91611	Someone to go over to the post office .	Get them to bring my stuff over .	and
0	60899	She grabbed him by his right shoulder .	Tried to shake him as gently as she could .	and
0	52303	She was sporting a most peculiar metal col ar .	Lady maccon was just bending down to examine it closer when she heard muffled footsteps in the hal way behind her .	and
0	36671	He held a short sword .	Called out with a steady , emotionless voice .	and
2	105685	I heard the sound of metal creaking .	I could hear something .	but
2	70223	My mind jumped to the conclusion that her father had either become an infected or one of the corpses lying about the compound .	I had to give this scared little girl some hope .	but
0	158443	We had a good record with them .	They pointed out the ridiculous actions of the sergeant to the guy from the jag .	and
4	24397	Crawled from his lap to the nook of his arm .	He leaned back on the bed and kicked off his shoes .	when
2	44559	Thought i was replying .	I dont remember what we were saying .	but
2	146718	He had had so many , over the two centuries , and she was the only one who still remained .	They were all gone .	but
2	148227	Just when she thought he was going to rip off her clothes and take her right there , up against the old metal slide , he pushed her away and .	Held her out at arm 's length .	but
4	158376	In the mirror i 'd been shocked at the movie star looking back at me .	I 'd seen myself .	when
3	55290	Pulling the sheets up to her chin-as .	A little layer of cotton and acrylic could shield her from the emotional punch of his words .	if
3	96788	You could pry away my fingers .	They were on fire .	if
0	49478	I come from a family of assassins .	Not all of them are tied to the league .	and
2	116538	In other wedding feasts dunk had attended , the pies had been filled with doves or songbirds .	Inside this one were bluejays and skylarks , pigeons and doves , mockingbirds and nightingales , small brown sparrows and a great red parrot .	but
0	140373	The two made their way to an elevator pressed the button for the top floor .	Entered the empty cab .	and
3	99055	They simply did not have the means to build it without furycrafting-which in turn makes it fairly obvious that alerans have never been without furycraft .	Even their more limited skill at it , in their day , mandated the use of assembled-parts construction , rather than modern methods that extrude all stone from the bedrock .	if
1	84511	This strong man who was always taking on other 's responsibilities himself was hurt .	She held back from him .	because
2	69500	He had said he would die trying .	I hoped that wouldnt happen .	but
0	84728	He went away most often for burglary and vandalism .	Violence was always mixed in there somewhere , always a part of the crime .	and
3	130580	They 'd have the essential elements of a sonoran system : pin-point accuracy in locating us .	The actual signal originates with them and is merely rebroadcast from our system .	if
0	159709	Caleb hung up the phone .	Continued to grimace at them .	and
2	10901	Whatever reluctance he might have felt had faded the second he 'd stood and .	Said let 's do it .	but
0	148492	Little s turned back to bonnie .	Gave him the ol shoulder shrug sign .	and
4	130863	All of the letters robin had sent her father .	She left for sherwood .	when
0	125375	I stepped over the bodies of fallen crovirs .	Caught up with them in the service tunnel under the gardens .	and
2	159094	It 's a sweet picture of the two of them . '' .	I was really surprised when i saw the next one .	but
2	105620	Images of his family filled his head .	They needed to get moving , no time to waste .	but
4	81575	He 'd realized that fact .	He 'd seen her fighting with harris .	when
2	16270	A pirate is normally by nature a raucous , wild creature .	The lads of the galley and gunnery were more disciplined and serious than most , especially when it came to war .	but
3	160453	Or we could not talk . '' .	That 's what you want .	if
1	158599	Martha is a victim of malnourishment .	She 's been withholding food .	because
0	14208	If he had one single brain cell left in his head , he 'd deplete her memory .	Dump her in the nearest hole .	and
4	49890	Aj and jenn struck a deal .	Jenn and the kids showed up a few hours .	when
3	94238	Jane would have my hide . '' .	She knew i was talking to you about it .	if
2	31621	A stake might not stop them .	Victoria knew she was stronger than three mortal men .	but
1	148453	I had to have a mini-cold shower in the laundromat .	That damn smooth-talking neighbor of ours cornered me .	because
2	131151	It was very backhanded .	That 's what you got with clarice - a tiny drop of honey with a huge dollop of vinegar .	but
3	56579	Maybe we could raise enough to satisfy the veyjiviks while we earn the rest of it .	The whole clan pitched in .	if
2	81505	I 'd been able to feel each individual line of blood at .	My skin grew dead to so much sensation .	but
0	8631	`` mei , '' temeraire said coldly , `` is a great scholar . '' .	Took highest honors in the imperial examinations .	and
0	15931	He paused in front of it .	Looked to the amazons just briefly before he stepped into it .	and
0	139971	All it takes is to touch the right stone in exactly the right way .	Thou hadst done it before it seemeth likely that it was but a simple matter of muscle memory in action .	and
2	21794	Just then the first crash came from the inside against it .	The iron was heavy and the second crash against the door was weaker .	but
2	85061	The time is not yet come for dorne to openly defy the iron throne , so we must needs return myrcella to her mother .	I will not be accompanying her .	but
2	114484	I asked what might be done to prevent it .	My word carried no weight , and ornenkai informs me that marankeil will not be dissuaded .	but
1	5428	People would search me out .	Theyd know im trustworthy .	because
2	22742	Rhaegar had named that place the tower of joy .	Ned it was a bitter memory .	but
2	34564	I glared at her and we were on the stairs .	Considered giving her a good whack with my drum .	but
0	75921	How to use your knives .	You have thick leather jackets for armor .	and
0	131179	He paused , hovering mid-air , and .	Began to draw in his breath .	and
4	39965	Not to hide my neck .	A ping of sensation snaked its way down to my groin .	when
2	43913	She could do nothing stare into his eyes .	He ran his thumb along her lip , and .	but
0	126185	I help you out .	This is how you repay me .	and
0	152255	His true father had welcomed him back into the fold .	Utter destruction had been the result .	and
4	120774	You hunt that sucker .	You 've got a lead .	when
3	51865	That was a professional job .	I ever saw one .	if
4	1275	I felt i did okay .	The performance came and we joined the thousands of other dancers on the football field .	when
1	47203	You have got to stop thinking about him .	He is clearly not thinking about you .	because
0	136326	She lifted her hand .	Rested her fingertips just below his ear .	and
0	28427	Where the tunnel spills out into the vast chamber .	Allows his gaze to run across the congregation of young dragons .	and
2	99783	He didnt know the precise reason .	Could tell what hed said had a profound effect on the man who led mother natures forces .	but
2	62952	The movement pulls the bite in my side .	There 's enough painkiller left in my system that it 's a bearable ache , not a sharp , stabbing pain .	but
0	63358	I force a small smile , pushing rachel 's words out of my ears .	Turn back to genna beside me .	and
0	131372	A shiver down his spine .	Made him feel queasy .	and
2	136525	On the surface they seemed the same .	They were n't . .	but
2	101853	The odd person was still rushing for the stairs .	The whole tier was pretty much empty , most of the remaining people downstairs on the lower level .	but
2	142962	She has no clue where he is .	She 'll ask around and meet me between third and fourth period at my locker .	but
0	5171	He tossed the reins back up over the saddle 's crest , sending him running back toward the legion , crashing through the heavy brush and small trees that had grown up behind him .	Slapped the beast on the flank .	and
4	150989	Turned around , and sat back against the bars .	It was all over , kathleen pried her hands from around the cage bars .	when
0	855	He dropped into a chair and began to dig through it .	Immediately grabbed one of the baskets .	and
4	101320	Only melissa and i were contacted in our sleep , why werent all of us affected by the stone .	My friends and i were in the hotel .	when
2	123990	He had no hope of battling a ghost for her affections .	Connor lassiter is still flesh and blood-which means he can be bested .	but
2	19587	I apologize for not telling you sooner .	I did not because of the obvious risk factor .	but
0	93438	I crossed the room .	Looked at noah 's bag .	and
0	91355	I 'm all right , '' luke said .	Drew his jacket aside to show the kindjal thrust through his belt .	and
3	22856	Which i had about three minutes ago , i could see the curve of her ass cheek .	I moved my head just a fraction of inch to the right and tipped my chin .	if
0	42706	We hit the ground .	He lost his mask .	and
0	90521	Most of them had probably never lost anyone to death .	Some looked grief-stricken while others were openly sobbing .	and
0	10614	Your service has been .	Now it is drawing to an end .	and
4	103811	Why i was petrified .	I heard the rumors that you were pregnant .	when
2	88282	We were able to dance to the last minute of it .	It was clear that brayden was disappointed .	but
2	93991	Ludendorff is always cautious - - ' adolf hitler began speaking slowly but firmly , lending a finality to each german phrase .	Herr hitler wishes to elaborate on your suggestion .	but
2	483	I could alert julio and cesaro .	They will have to unravel the safeguards and it is very dangerous .	but
2	76779	I turned , not expecting her to follow .	She did , pausing just inside my room while i crossed to the dresser .	but
0	150671	I ever so slowly and carefully shoved back my covers and sat up .	Slipped my legs around to the side of the bed .	and
0	55307	But they will poke the poor soul ... ' the alleyway opened into a yard , like a well between the high buildings .	Call him such names .	and
2	15663	Three hours here seem to have already passed .	He hasnt come for my help .	but
2	159417	She was more insane and .	The last three years of her rule proved it .	but
3	105702	I 'm so sorry . '' .	I did anything to lead you on .	if
0	112464	The door to their bedroom was closed .	No one was in the apartment .	and
2	152795	It looked too dirty and uninviting for an orphanage .	I had no way of telling .	but
4	103253	To get along want to risk wrecking a wonderful friendship .	Things werent going in her favor , she didnt .	when
0	92801	Repulsed by her thoughts , she put the glass aside went downstairs to watch a movie .	Washed up her few dishes .	and
0	151736	He spoke sternly , hoping by firmness to keep the boy from spreading the tale , at least .	If the fear kept him wakeful for the rest of the night , it would be so much the better .	and
0	129859	I pulled my hand .	Shrank from the woman .	and
0	62686	The beam is our course now . '' .	The needle will show it .	and
0	25241	To indulge in blood magic .	Thus destroy us all .	and
2	117054	It took a week for them to clean out the fourteen houses .	Only a storm interrupted their progress .	but
2	9865	I 've got to find some way to give myself an edge tomorrow , or . '' .	It 's all over but the crying .	but
4	129167	My guilt was overwhelming .	I heard from your mother that you lost the baby .	when
2	10082	Didnt get burnt as far as i noticed .	I did crash into a cactus .	but
3	46614	We could be happy .	You 'd just give us a chance .	if
3	54496	They 'd be more freaked out .	They caught the whole massive bulk of him .	if
4	131360	She looked up at me , her eyes full of fear .	She realized who i was .	when
2	78359	He made a reach for my arm .	I jerked myself out of the way .	but
0	27605	I 'm so sorry for any distress that has been caused .	I look forward to seeing you .	and
0	38938	But it had clean sheets , reasonably fluffy pillows .	( i saw during a fast reconnaissance ) complimentary little soaps .	and
2	73100	He was looking for something .	He did not know what .	but
1	11909	Until now it had stayed sorta hazy in my mind .	I was so hurt and tired .	because
4	127696	I should have stolen his car . '' .	I had the chance .	when
0	41326	The realization made his headache fade .	He stepped a little closer .	and
3	100006	To ask and wondering .	I was more a masochist than i ever suspected .	if
2	1402	All this inner anxiety , and i still hadnt hit the wall of embarrassment .	It was coming up .	but
3	86752	I would give my own life .	I could take away her disease .	if
0	565	I stepped behind the counter put my messenger bag on the floor next to a large gray wicker basket .	Laid my food down on it .	and
0	35778	Where they faced one other with forward gazes .	Hands clasped regally at the waist .	and
2	81105	'' he said gently , and he realized at once he had to get her away from the scene of what obviously looked to her to be preparations for a full-scale battle .	The eyes she raised to him were wild with terror .	but
2	112681	I thought my master was simply telling stories .	Now i realize he was .	but
2	76340	She 's a very beautiful girl .	I 'm in love with you .	but
3	81588	Then there probably is .	You think there 's a reaper after you .	if
0	100186	He grabbed her wrist .	Brandished a knife , clean and sharp , the handle made of blonde wood below a strip of chrome .	and
0	25685	Who retrieved another red-filled bag from a cooler .	Ripped the end open .	and
0	121478	The vietnam war had barged into my consciousness .	That always put me in a rotten temper .	and
0	96272	Just listen to the sound of my voice .	Imagine what i look like .	and
0	72359	Tusk , too , had suddenly lost his stoicism .	Looked about , alarmed .	and
2	158571	He 's my brother , and you need to learn the lay of the land .	He 's your husband .	but
3	62041	Straff will try to execute us .	We do survive the koloss attack .	if
2	143197	He 's trying his best to play by her rules , to sound mature . '' .	I hear the catch in his voice when he says : `` i really need to see her .	but
0	37050	I cracked one of them open slathered it all over my hands and arms .	Dipped my fingers into the ointment .	and
0	144646	Is back in play .	It is held by adam thorne .	and
2	102850	Their eyes met ; an undesirable chance with unknown persons , and a reason to deronda for not looking .	He immediately found an open prayer-book pushed toward him and had to bow his thanks .	but
0	15580	But this is about her future ... '' `` that 's why i 'll be with you through all this .	I get it wrong .	and
0	114134	He grabbed me by my hair , but because he was so drunk he wasnt very steady .	Was trying to pull me .	and
0	3324	The murgo swallowed hard .	Thrust the documents back into sadi 's hands as if they had suddenly grown hot .	and
2	77688	The simple black print had faded .	The name of the firm was still legible .	but
4	38179	He probably got her pregnant .	They were both a little older than me .	when
3	45529	Every ion particle charged with electricity .	Waiting for one spark to discharge the entire amount in a massive outrush of energy .	if
0	48010	He put his hands over hers .	Pushed them back down to her sides .	and
2	138326	Now she seemed panicked .	She could do anything he was binding her wrists with a length of twine hed been concealing about his person .	but
4	107589	He said he had once played a cop in a summer stock production of detective story .	They told him they were police detectives .	when
2	92663	His eyes couldnt help .	Read the last sentence as he placed the quill on the spot noal had instructed .	but
0	98477	Ive had sex for over four hundred years .	Now you want me to just stop .	and
4	117264	The aroma of coffee was filling the rooms .	She got to the first floor .	when
3	13972	... she glanced at della .	She resented his authoritative tone .	if
0	22609	Who 'd been in bed the night through with the megrims .	Had thus missed the most riotous , beautiful , exciting night of all .	and
0	30765	Reached into my pocket .	Pulled out a piece of chalk .	and
4	4429	He fell to pieces .	At least it came to me .	when
0	30277	Either isaac did it .	You 're covering for him and hoping for leniency .	and
0	35690	Ian and i came up with a training program for you last night .	It is best if we start .	and
3	42302	To notify the internal revenue service .	You continue your illegal activities .	if
2	155111	Thirty-three the huge human cook awoke before dawn with her mouth watering from a dream of strawberries .	When she went yawning into the dooryard to gather some , she found the runners plucked clean of every last fruit .	but
2	54767	He offered us menus .	We told him we were ready to order .	but
0	85524	She searched for the source of the noise .	Saw someone blowing into a conch shell .	and
4	149356	But , they 're in the way .	I try and squat .	when
0	12691	He shifted his mouth to nip at her ear .	Was rewarded as her body shuddered with undisguised need .	and
2	156643	See himself as mayoral in any single way .	As timmy conveyed his opinion of gabriel , the compliments and possibilities began to stir in the old mans mind .	but
3	58651	I have to add another notch to my bedpost ! '' .	Now you 'll excuse me .	if
0	98635	Keenan snaked through the streets , guiding the bike .	She held him tighter .	and
1	134057	Maybe it was , indicating that some healing was going on somewhere in my body .	My head felt better and the bruising was switching colors .	because
1	142120	`` , '' martin pointed out .	He knows why craig came to lawrenceton .	because
0	62886	The troll sat down stuffed the entire animal in his mouth .	Picked up a hog .	and
2	155202	I wanted to tell sky .	A part of me knew that jax had kept it a secret for a reason .	but
4	113008	Louisa was sad , with the scaffolding outside .	She saw her home gutted and empty .	when
0	48776	I was so busy trying to get through classes figure out what in the world was going on with my relationship with levi , that before i knew it , it was october .	Go out enough to enjoy the experience .	and
0	104739	He had an agenda .	He was playing to win everything from this woman .	and
2	124398	Jamie left his rifle in its sling .	Checked the priming of the pistols in his saddle holsters .	but
2	74153	I was glad id achieved my objective of understating patricks reaction .	It kind of freaked me out how easily it had come and how even easier everyone had bought it .	but
2	95661	Outside , the wood seemed unchanged , and there was a gathering scent of fresh , dew-tipped grass .	The air did not seem so dank and heavy .	but
0	51758	Them plunging through deep , swampy water .	Scrambling over high cliffs that lawrence never even knew existed .	and
0	106542	My soul screamed in bleeding agony .	I wanted to die rather than live one more day in a world where you exist .	and
3	72594	Then he 'll never finish his commercial .	You interrupt him with your news .	if
0	103656	All thought of home is gone by .	Kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day , or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours .	and
2	84318	Not really thanking her .	Only mouthing a word .	but
2	152338	Fifty-one years of happiness were more than many got .	If one was left behind , it would still never be .	but
2	131308	Zane nodded and he kept his eyes on ty .	Moved one hand to put the damp towel to use .	but
2	44098	I could feel the rage pumping off him , saw it in his eyes .	He remained controlled and eerily methodical .	but
0	95370	He snatched it away from her .	Practically swallowed it whole before the horribly bitter flavor overwhelmed his senses .	and
0	37686	Police officers scuttled about the front lawn .	A contingent of them stood guarding the gate .	and
2	1092	I thought the place was empty .	Now that the shower is off , i can hear a kind of muffled sobbing coming from one of the stalls .	but
0	103665	Uncle ira dipped his handkerchief in the river .	Wiped off docs face .	and
0	72553	The horses were cared for first , the tents went .	Then we all trooped down to the river , where a horde was already bathing .	and
0	154620	She bowed very low .	Leapt from the top of the building to the street behind the palazzo before disappearing into the shadows .	and
4	131610	Things got pretty awkward .	I saw you at your club .	when
2	124539	Ryan had seen a hint of emotion in her eyes and .	Held out hope for when she met sam .	but
0	135932	She started the engine .	Taxied toward the runway .	and
2	19895	They glanced at us .	No one challenged us or asked to see identification until we got to the steps leading up to the plane .	but
4	17350	Mainly her mom was an expert .	It came to the manipulative power of motherhood .	when
1	142159	Oh , yes and i 've been listening to some reports on television , and through the media , that that del monte catsup bottle has become infamous .	I used to listen to monday night football and i listened to the world series .	because
4	23072	I start to drift off to sleep .	She says something i dont catch .	when
1	28441	Okay , listen marty .	This one is up to you .	because
2	127193	His arms convulsing around her .	He again got no .	but
2	126713	Occasionally , he would step out with his wife .	It was always at the same place , where he ordered the same thing .	but
2	56691	It was a simple pump failure the failure of the operator to instigate proper emergency procedures in a timely manner , the report stated .	Magnified the impact of the incident .	but
2	7898	If he wanted to , he had a lot of chances for the last eight months .	He never did try anything-anything to imply that he was interested , at all .	but
4	19094	Julia had very bad luck .	It came to thanksgiving .	when
4	156227	She apologized , im sorry , joshua .	She felt more serene .	when
2	85796	All the girls wanted him .	Lisa was the one who got him .	but
0	136205	Ash gazed straight ahead , not moving a muscle .	A sob tore free from my throat .	and
2	5644	You were the one .	Was convinced when you tracked down our little charade of pillagers in such rapid fashion .	but
2	139017	Gillian was a royal pain in the ass sometimes ; scotty had a compassion far beyond his years .	She would grow out of it .	but
1	37302	Who 'd like a steamy hot chocolate topped with whipped cream .	You want to mix hot and cold .	because
0	905	Their laughs were half forced , their smiles almost wan in the dark light every now and then they would turn beyond their wall of steel , gazing into the deep orifices of the forest beyond .	The men and women chatted under the pretense of composure , but .	and
0	45871	The captive price gave a little moan .	Beauty could see his chest heave with his breath .	and
3	83039	There must be something wrong with you .	You think i 'm going to fall for that .	if
2	91040	There was no night this side of hancox 1 .	We knew what he meant .	but
2	40053	There were no tracks yet , nothing to indicate the presence of another human being .	He was certain he was heading in the right direction .	but
0	109051	She was silent for a short time .	Then her voice became remarkably calm .	and
3	32269	I 'm in one piece .	You let me get off the damn phone and into the helicopter .	if
2	26858	I 'll work on separating those .	What little i 've seen so far appears to be class notes , quizzes .	but
0	145723	Repairing cleaning the sails .	Working on the deck and all the tackle , keeping the ship well-maintained .	and
2	98196	I claw my way forward and .	Twist my foot out of my shoe .	but
2	145408	Colin had never understood this .	Now thousands of strings were fluttering over and around and past him , and they were both tiny broken beams of light and endless , undulating waves .	but
0	111046	Cameron had freckles across her nose .	She was shorter , and her build was more compact than mine .	and
0	78998	Spiritual ideas and ideals turn into rituals and laws .	The love for god is replaced by the fear of god .	and
3	122866	It sit idle in its holster .	Its services were needed .	if
0	58229	Smiling , i tugged the wool blanket tighter around me .	Scooted my folding chair closer to the small fire robbie had started in the backyard .	and
1	45173	A police officer or a hospital doctor would have called us by now if any of those things had happened .	She would certainly have her credit cards and license on her .	because
3	50203	`` okay , you want it . '' .	That 's the way .	if
1	2410	I will have lunch with you while you swim with your trunks on .	I 'm hungry and i 'll sit in the garden .	because
0	25777	The grip against my wrist tightens .	My body pulls into him a little closer , almost protective .	and
0	39416	Monty jacked his belt up higher on his bay window .	Ran a hand over his moussed-back hair .	and
3	158643	I can write anything .	Laleh and gwen tell me to .	if
3	100182	I did wonder . '' .	It might be the weres .	if
3	70657	Even so , none of it was a real problem .	He was with her .	if
2	104701	My father had been dead for years .	My mother had only been a widow for a week , and suddenly i felt guilty for standing there , spying .	but
4	39104	One might hear in a zombie movie .	A corpse has come back to life after some years .	when
0	29312	David nodded , touched the spine .	Never taking his eyes off the book .	and
3	106487	We just moved from a position of power to a position of weakness .	That vote goes through .	if
3	100690	You know what i mean .	He relaxes me too much i 'm going to have a problem .	if
0	80410	No one knew much about his past before he had arrived in town .	Bryce had never felt any impulse to enlighten anyone on that subject .	and
0	23958	I stood up straight .	Took in a deep breath .	and
0	4652	The fires that had been started in the morning were still burning .	At times she had to leave the path and scramble around plumes of smoke and flame .	and
4	92211	He would often ponder the connection he had with the universe and explore his own mind by the analysis of things human .	He was off duty .	when
4	60164	How you stole my heart .	No one else could find it .	when
2	145450	I 'm not sure how i 'm going to convince the obin of that .	I 'm going to do it .	but
0	122764	He had no leverage to fight , nothing to hang onto .	The earth around him was shifting and sliding .	and
0	33390	You could easily train a force of a thousand men .	Yet have plenty of room left over for a game of magic ball .	and
2	51179	* * * kelly had been tense , waiting for mark to make a pass at her .	He was always the perfect gentleman .	but
0	43555	The woman gave angell other look then before in her big eyes .	The girl was very satisfied to see pity in them .	and
4	40697	Struggle to keep my eyes off her .	Especially she 's looking my way .	when
2	135161	Lightning might not strike twice in the same place .	A drive-by was a crapshoot .	but
0	77464	But dont you worry none , i just called miss anoothi , explaining to her our situation .	She has agreed to give you a ride to your new place .	and
0	58010	She closed the door , the security chain rattled .	Then she opened it .	and
3	35648	`` would it be so bad ? '' .	We got started on kids sooner rather than .	if
1	102842	`` '' he said , tossing her a mango he fished from a tray .	It 's mango season .	because
2	64558	I 'm not rich . '' .	I have some money .	but
0	21376	One second it was a tiny , harmless spider .	In the next , it was a beautiful woman with a vampiric dental problem .	and
2	40076	Not only was it burning my thighs .	My pants were stained with coffee .	but
2	120773	Yoshimizu didnt tell them about the assassination of his brother .	There is no way to stop this war if no one will listen .	but
4	111622	We met at a time , and we had our needs fulfilled .	We both needed something .	when
2	112757	It had been handy .	It might not have been the best choice under the circumstances .	but
2	91702	Dad never makes me feel like a disappointment .	I know i am .	but
0	93126	`` come on , kids , '' he said .	The followed him out of the office .	and
0	26270	There were many more channelers .	We were trained from a young age .	and
2	144254	She thought she escaped on her own .	He was deliberately sloppy .	but
3	125203	Who worked the radio .	He could borrow the wireless .	if
0	148249	Arms waved , and through the excitement there came the sounds of derision , and beauty 's heart thudded as she tried not to see too clearly what lay ahead , though she could not turn .	Cheers rose as the slaves drew closer .	and
0	38935	Long after ramses was arrested-thanks to harry turning state 's evidence on his father-the city condemned the tunnels .	Filled all the entrances with concrete .	and
4	71055	She 'd explain to prentice that she 'd like to stay in their lives , talk to them on the phone , send them things .	The spirit moved her and maybe even come visit once in .	when
2	120345	I knew my actions would be futile , would probably make things worse for all of us .	I did not care .	but
2	153652	I 'm not an expert .	From what i 've seen , things usually come to you .	but
0	791	She was small light fitting onto a narrow path that would be difficult for his much larger and heavier frame .	Barely skimming the ground as she ran .	and
2	93341	I was talking to hayden the other day and he never mentioned it was you .	He said someone was covering the information .	but
2	82208	He thought her color had been better when he left the room and that she might actually sleep a little .	It was obvious now that she was a long way from sleeping .	but
4	157342	Casey had promised to text me .	She was on her way home from the party .	when
1	63273	You 're good enough for her .	When you find the right fit .	because
4	58471	Engineered some kind of barrier for the door .	The last of morley 's people were crammed into the small room .	when
2	10638	The official borders might have shown it to be one cohesive city .	The area was really divided into two distinct sections - northtown and southtown .	but
0	108329	The new century has arrived .	With it comes a set of dangers and threats that could threaten the very existence of france and its allies .	and
3	156191	With her shoulders squared and her chin up , she said , `` , i 'd like to study in your library .	It would be all right with you .	if
0	68261	His knee pressed into my thigh .	His hands gripped my wrists , pressing them to the cold floor .	and
0	152748	He pulled the ring from trent .	Let him fall to the ground .	and
0	107863	Then kulingile had demane clutched in one talon .	Lifting him padded away over the sand , saying , `` demane , you are .	and
4	54835	He hesitated a moment .	He looked at me .	when
4	88537	He was long past the age .	Most andarions took mates .	when
2	146727	I started to pull my hand .	She laid her cheek back against my chest and wrapped an arm around my waist .	but
2	88927	Probably courtesy of the brandy , love grinned to himself .	It did the job .	but
0	140093	The other customers joined in the laughter .	It took a minute for the big drunk man to understand what they were laughing .	and
0	146292	The reports call for calm seas .	It will be a quarter moon .	and
2	129556	So prettily , jenny could not , in the spirit of the evening and the dictates of good manners , do anything accept it , which she did .	The apology was made with such sincerity , and .	but
0	83796	I heard a sharp grinding noise .	Pictured lucius working his jaw .	and
4	91726	Her affection had died an irrevocable death .	They had bought roger out of trouble the first time he 'd really hurt her .	when
2	88115	Usually the room was more cheerful in the daylight .	This morning the sunlight gave it a queer tinge .	but
0	61035	I hauled out the mop then did a little vacuuming after that .	Cleaned the kitchen floor .	and
3	99863	As the trentons ' own was , the pinto would not have made it .	It had been an uphill driveway all the way .	if
0	3295	Looking past the man .	Hatefully zeroing in on guy .	and
0	121206	Most of the queue wanted to get in on the act , whatever the act turned out to be .	The rest were queueing on the basis that there might be something interesting at the other end .	and
2	131855	When you 're with me .	What i can tell you only hurt yourself a little .	but
0	54826	Which had been prepared for him .	Upended it into his mouth .	and
3	107229	Then jem was the child of it , no matter the circumstances of his birth .	There was a true marriage between them .	if
0	50279	They stripped the rags from me , and then they shaved my head and my loins , and they rubbed my skin with goose-grease .	Washed the filth from me .	and
3	23434	`` , i was being incredibly nice .	You 're referring to the countess sophia .	if
0	111078	Consult with our allies .	Take every measure to ensure that our defenses remain intact .	and
2	64214	If you must please try and .	Stay alive for the senator .	but
0	112738	As my phone loaded , i got my keys and my wallet .	Then i went outside and ran to my car .	and
0	126990	I still feel the pull of you . '' .	I find it ... delicious .	and
2	77730	The injury had been from a rape , and .	Isaac cursed himself for mentioning it .	but
2	60841	I tried to stay calm .	Have to admit i felt my face flush a bit .	but
4	96581	I was eager for lunch but before i could even get my key out to unlock my door i was accosted by another woman .	I got back to my office .	when
4	29259	He knew his more senior fellows .	They were feeling helpful .	when
0	73216	They staggered through the cave .	Behind them , cerberus 's growls grew louder .	and
2	9742	It 's really only a tiny difference .	... '' `` ... but you feel like that tiny bit is crucial .	but
0	62758	To be impervious to pain or suffering .	Among them endurance was lauded .	and
0	29301	Let it only take place in paris , or istanbul , or china .	Woolvey would read of it in the papers and applaud .	and
2	26427	You can do it , thal said .	Then noticed the palpable tension in rainer that signified pain .	but
2	45023	Do even in darkness what you would in light , so that you will not be ashamed .	Walk in the lightness of a clear conscience .	but
0	97211	`` one day you 'll be doin ' this on your own . '' .	I 'll be whisperin ' to you from the wind .	and
0	122395	It was just right , exquisite .	He moved with her in short , frantic lunges .	and
2	136356	Kill the daimons to free the human souls .	Play nice with everyone .	but
2	141196	I knew ben would never convince lacey to go to prom with him .	I figured he at least deserved the opportunity .	but
4	101857	It is near sunset .	The aged freighter enters the marquesas island chain .	when
2	26952	Joan had been afraid it would be awkward , coming to michael 's bereaved and empty house , as became a distant kinswoman and a daughter of god .	Had steeled herself to offer comfort and support .	but
2	148354	He didnt say he wanted a room .	He did ask for you by name .	but
2	123148	Tried to picture the woman in her minds eye .	The only thing that surfaced were the notes shed written .	but
4	18949	He saw need written .	He looked up from her lap and saw her eyes .	when
2	107393	She 'd known there was a sexual spark between them from the start .	Hearing him say out loud that he still wanted her was shocking .	but
2	35581	She had knocked gently on the door .	They hadnt heard her .	but
3	149863	He 'd likely spend the next twenty hours worshipping her with his hands .	He admitted to having the entire day .	if
0	108404	When something like this happens .	The guy holding the doomed mans hand says , youre going to be alright .	and
3	107552	It could be difficult for him .	The police became involved .	if
2	12473	You 're not trying to stop her from going .	You must be able to reach her .	but
3	19135	But it would do her reputation no good to be seen coming out of the woods this late at night with a young man .	Even the person approaching was a friend .	if
2	56687	Like i should be glad to do nothing .	Attend school and sew with momma oaks .	but
3	48509	My lips would meet his lips .	I leaned in one inch more .	if
2	120592	In the new world my people have become civilised .	They have also grown weak .	but
1	150468	`` i can read her mind .	She is connected to me .	because
3	124156	He could never reload in time to hit all three riders , probably not even two .	Even he hit his target .	if
0	151425	After night had fallen , an old delivery van arrived .	The two bodies were removed .	and
2	118718	And sure , they had a military arm .	That was for defense and protection , not for assault .	but
2	7501	Nadia turned back to him .	Mateo was already looking away from her , as if unwilling to meet her eyes .	but
0	130130	I 'm the co-ruler of your line .	I 'm stating my intentions toward an enemy who has butchered our people .	and
2	150522	There was often laughter in the label .	Brett had understood it to mean that guemes held a large number of worshipers - very religious , fundamentalist people .	but
0	111712	Scratching his head , theres this whole bit in the shamanic texts , prophecies stuff , and they think that day is .	About how one day the seraphs will return to us to save us .	and
2	84059	The fire slowed the aelfinn .	Soon the more daring members of the band slithered through the smoke .	but
0	160329	But my father grew sick .	The priest said he did not have long to live , and i was selected among my brothers to bear these stories for the village .	and
2	115649	I havent seen any .	Teal told me that she occasionally saw them .	but
0	17091	When i got back upstairs lucy was done in the bathroom .	Was staring blankly from her perch on my bed .	and
0	100180	Now , i cant stand in the field , but i can put on enough pressure that hell try .	Make him do it .	and
0	157001	Daria bounded into the room .	Ran right up to where we were on the couch .	and
2	134494	Maybe that sounded a little pathetic or overeager .	I was exhausted with the games i had been playing with guys since i had turned thirteen and sprouted br**sts . .	but
0	2323	Their torsos were columnar , seemingly of uniform breath at hip and waist and shoulder .	Surely they must weigh more than three hundred pounds apiece , although somehow the dominant impression they created was one of grace and suppleness .	and
3	64566	We 'd be dead from a lot of things .	This was the real world .	if
3	57174	Could i get a white dress .	I was showing up to the altar with a big belly full of babies .	if
3	120566	We 'll have no damages to support a claim for restitution other than our claim expenses .	You return the settlement .	if
3	63050	Then why did you not recede and allow her to rule you .	You were ready to die over this .	if
0	30054	Either way , she kept moving forward stopped .	Reached the center of the ring .	and
0	144580	In addition , she had styled her short hair into a chichi wave .	Touched up her eyes and lips with a little make-up .	and
1	95910	And that worries me .	Two of trixis sisters are on that planet .	because
0	118732	Women were transported separately from men .	Jessie , accompanied by kenya , drove us over to the courthouse .	and
4	150057	To put himself in that category .	They 'd first met .	when
2	60137	Now he believed he had something truly magical on his hands and .	He planned to use that to his advantage .	but
1	55418	Listen to me carefully . '' .	I have a plan .	because
3	137379	That meant she 'd be staying in san francisco , and that was the last thing dylan wanted .	Claire kept the apartment .	if
0	8103	Vin felt their pain , their terror .	She cried out as she reached to protect them .	and
3	130904	Him knowing i hurt .	Even he could grant me painkillers .	if
0	35146	It is a gamble . '' .	You do not strike me as the kind of man who gambles .	and
4	127838	Things had picked up , and when candice , their next-door neighbour had suggested they tried high-class hooking , patsy had done it without a thought .	Susan came to live with her .	when
0	150471	Based on what she could guess , elisa was a good six hundred years old .	Yet she looked no more than fifty winters or .	and
3	107390	... '' i let that statement hang , on its own , for quite a while .	Only i 'd met you sooner .	if
3	44102	You can not resist the urge to jump between them .	You 're a kid .	if
3	20057	She could just see the front door .	Olivia looked through the gap between the breastplate and the arm piece .	if
4	130323	She does the same thing .	It comes to the jewel and this journey .	when
4	34774	Cayman had hit the nail on the head .	He said it only had to be a carnal sin .	when
4	103506	Brenda hesterman and donald callaway had told me a few of the smaller pieces had sold .	I 'd dropped by splendide the week .	when
0	37481	I may have underestimated you a tad .	Have made the right choice after all .	and
0	116451	J ducked to one side .	Tossed his towel in the guys face .	and
2	64258	Rafael stood there looking fit , much more fit than he had a right to .	He bore the signs of his brush with death .	but
3	98223	`` would it matter ? '' .	I told you no .	if
0	51895	Tachyon 's eyes fluttered .	He fell to the pavement .	and
0	108614	Connor climbed to his feet in a second .	Disappeared the moment he saw mr. henderson blink .	and
0	86189	Tearing it up , then he went crazy in the hospital .	Had to have shifter bureau send in goons .	and
4	20564	She nearly runs into me .	I stop suddenly to look back at her .	when
0	115067	I gave him the same reason i 'd given talon .	He turned , offering me his arm .	and
3	160671	Also , you should indicate .	You want an autopsy .	if
4	48599	Rebecca remembered josh 's answer .	She 'd asked him if they 'd be getting married .	when
4	20157	The gps directions to cordova 's house on screen .	Vance opened the door and stuck his torso in .	when
4	21693	I realised i 'd been wearing gret 's face .	I took the mask off .	when
1	4475	How harsh his voice sounded .	He turned and gave me a thin smile .	because
2	154872	Her aura was blue .	Fading , the other colors having vanished .	but
3	84000	Marie-josephe struggled to remain calm .	You returned to saint-cyr ... '' .	if
4	141400	She was fired on the spot and escorted out of the office by an armed guard .	He returned a week .	when
0	50220	He was a gunslinger .	That was the name they used on his wanted posters .	and
3	95738	Any girl in her right mind would obey his orders .	He shouted them out-with the exception of me of course .	if
0	101327	The distributors went to the elfins ; a percentage of santas business if they went on strike .	Offered them a package they couldnt refuse .	and
4	129679	He held his breath for a second , crushed amongst the countless women in huge hats .	He saw her at the back of the hall .	when
2	106064	It took us several minutes to find a ladder to take us to the seventh level .	Once we found it we were set .	but
0	21040	He shrugged , raising his open hands to his shoulders .	She had to laugh .	and
4	152027	Myrnin was heading for kim .	She picked up a crossbow lying on a table nearby and shot him point-blank in the chest .	when
2	136017	When she heard granny ramble on about witchcraft she longed for the cutting magic of wizardry .	Whenever she heard treatle speak in his high-pitched voice she would fight to the death for witchcraft .	but
2	22069	When beth realised this , she couldnt help , although she felt sure there couldnt be any connection .	Recall the way the coin had landed that way up so many more times .	but
2	443	He may be fine .	He may be a jekyll and hyde if things start to go wrong .	but
2	106540	He had been sweating in the suffocating heat .	Suddenly the heat inside him was so blistering that it made the outer temperature seem cool in comparison .	but
0	54591	Flames danced in the lobby fireplace .	The air carried the odor of lemon-scented cleansers .	and
1	103580	I think she must 've cared for him .	The two of them had some time on the run , before roland caught up with them , and it must 've been bliss because when voron spoke of it , everything about him changed .	because
0	24518	Yet all he seemed to have was wolf the few possessions he owned you could pack in a suitcase , and .	There was of course her , if he wanted .	and
0	74482	He reached the end of the high counter .	Saw a large crystal ball unattended .	and
0	71973	He took the timber .	Struck it against the rock .	and
4	47854	To ask about the sugar .	Asia dashed into the office .	when
3	140269	They would report back to edwin sutton and that fat little fucker would enjoy this too much .	Anyone did see him alone in a bar in boston .	if
4	113943	To nece as they sat in front of a glass window upon the second level , we will electrocute them .	They are in rage .	when
2	67835	It 's not a long kiss , just a few seconds , his breath tastes fresh , and that even a even a starter kiss from him feels a bit like magic and music and falling all in one .	Enough time for me to notice his lips are soft and full .	but
2	87890	I usually run at 6:00 .	'' she loses her train of thought as her eyes settle on my lips , on my piercing .	but
4	93409	They 'll do that .	You 're a double d and you left your bra on the floor upstairs .	when
4	151148	All covered with dirt and grime , hed insisted she shower .	Theyd arrived back at the cabin .	when
2	64914	His eyes showed no emotion .	He was still he watched her face .	but
4	77879	Had gravitated to each other .	We started a few short months .	when
0	50865	Fionn shrugged drained its contents .	Lifted the wine cup to his lips .	and
0	120346	Evidently , some of our assumptions are wrong . '' .	We 'd better find out which ones and .	and
3	68816	I guess i would have to ask a person .	You really wan na know how i 'd get one .	if
1	72236	Weldon and i were chased out of his room .	We could hear every bit of what was going on .	because
0	8354	The woman behind the desk dragged her hands through her hair .	Glanced up at claire .	and
0	26293	Even so , my wrists were red .	Raw i 'm free .	and
0	27200	I swung around , brushing ice across my skin .	Walked through the door to get my clothes his chuckles followed .	and
0	9151	She chided herself for being such a chicken headed back out into the world .	Got safely in the car .	and
4	104042	I found that my parents still had something in common .	I started splitting my time between my house and my dad 's downtown apartment .	when
4	15819	She hit it with somethin ' ! '' .	She walked over there .	when
3	130132	You do damage to the king .	You do any damage to them or their houses or their property .	if
1	123604	I was being unfaithful to max .	I was enjoying the company and the closeness .	because
2	97938	Why she hired him .	Knight always seemed so invincible .	but
4	112832	He moved his other foot cautiously to the next , making sure to keep his feet as far to the edge of the board as possible , just as james had said .	He realized it would hold his weight .	when
2	29467	I was hoping for doves and angels and fluffy clouds .	I 'd take there being no more pain .	but
3	13240	But you must remember to give it your full attention .	You wish to orchestrate your consciousness .	if
0	19279	Kenzie saw what i was doing .	Gave a sharp gasp .	and
0	854	She closed the door .	I heard the bolt click home .	and
2	95034	On the other side of the door was a tiny room barely bigger than the holding cells .	It had some semblance of privacy .	but
0	132163	Wes takes in a breath .	His chest expands the size of a football field .	and
2	79452	I realize i 've got a lot to learn . '' .	I 'm strong and determined and willing to work .	but
0	40142	I picked up the phone .	Hit the button for the front desk .	and
1	95665	I hope you like oatmeal . '' .	That 's pretty much all we have .	because
3	70449	Then it was my fault .	I was stuck wearing a poofy yellow dress with a ginormous flower on the side .	if
0	119939	He 'll continue the fight , and i 'm not willing to let that happen . '' .	Kill every man in the legions if that 's what it takes to get his victory .	and
4	52250	I had just arrived .	The building had begun to burn .	when
2	86503	The answer raised more questions than it resolved .	He let it go .	but
4	31882	I pretended not to notice her scrutiny .	Reagan narrowed her sharp thirteen-year-old eyes on us .	when
3	84643	They would have made it .	They 'd gone to early mass .	if
0	25982	He sniffed officiously then turned and left .	Thrust his nose up into the air .	and
4	120972	I can see some sport in givin ' him a touch of anxiety and causin ' him to eat crow from a woman 's hand .	It comes to pullin ol ' buck 's short hairs .	when
2	155948	He 's telling the truth .	My temper is already boiling .	but
0	21267	Just you had fallen asleep as was possible .	Made your cold narrow bed as warm and comfortable .	and
0	114829	It was exhausting i needed a drink .	It was a blast but .	and
2	141958	Which was now a leather satchel instead of a cereal box .	Still contained a variety of items that might come in handy .	but
2	105223	In the shadows she could not make out his expression .	She was sure his eyes were closed .	but
4	31103	She quickly pulled off the sweatshirt and dropped it on the floor .	She reached the edge of his bed .	when
2	154064	Then we could go on as .	Her doing a better job .	but
2	9059	It 's beautiful and this time it seemed even more .	The soil as well as the water is rich and rejuvenating .	but
0	53996	One of the servants began playing a small , stringed instrument .	They lapsed into a relaxed silence .	and
4	81407	The buyer already sat astride a horse .	Cole reached the mules .	when
2	113953	I mean , i would have done it if it had just been sex .	Dammit , you were - do you understand .	but
2	64643	You went along with our research .	Until now i thought that you might have been an immari loyalist , someone working to obtain my research .	but
4	145374	In fairness , ive exhausted a goodly number of excuses .	Trading a days wage for a hook and string .	when
2	51805	No love was lost .	The alternative to all out war , was a scrappy understanding .	but
0	57695	`` me , i suppose , '' was his answer , and he was gone .	Then the door opened and closed .	and
0	108341	We 'd pick a spot along the trail with high ground that favours us . '' .	That gives us a good vantage of an open narrow length of trail below .	and
0	121504	They walked into the chilly night .	Stopped at the center of the compound .	and
0	65958	His approach had been seen .	Ding dong ... james lockwood bell , had been the first to horse .	and
3	56443	I just entered the edge of it .	My latitude and longitude calculations are correct .	if
2	141382	The man extracted his hand .	His warm smile never faltered .	but
3	53444	You 're out of luck .	You want to hold my hand .	if
0	75824	We were in a house-sized coffin .	Every step we took forward was a step into the ground .	and
2	84916	I know that you 're afraid of what you 're feeling .	There 's no need rachel .	but
2	132309	My body wanted rest .	My mind raced with anxiety .	but
2	151271	I thought he liked dogs .	He doesnt even care about them .	but
0	18557	Sometimes , like the thorn you know in our world , they can battle their way back to the light .	Put the darkness behind them even though it continues to try and reclaim them .	and
3	108731	He would probably say that he was indeed acting out of respect .	Someone were to ask king aud .	if
2	117372	An attitude of redundancy played for all members of the guild .	He didnt like taking any chances .	but
4	52041	Me open my mouth .	The music is on .	when
2	104892	`` my dear english captain , he might wish to hang them .	He would never hire them .	but
0	59820	When he saw i was waiting , he looked stricken .	Hurried up to the car .	and
2	109904	Of course , it was easier with such a small population .	She was still impressed .	but
2	28514	It 's mostly cans and the few bottles of water that look tolerable .	He 's also found some sugar that 's not too hard to chip chunks out of and some dried meats vacuum-packed in plastic that may not be too petrified to eat .	but
4	33992	So and i said i would take his head if he did not start confessing the darkest of his crimes , then , my stars , did it all come out .	I had my guards lash him to within an inch of his life .	when
0	144257	I feel the blush , pulling out pieces of cheese and butter .	Comb my fingers through my hair .	and
0	15636	Maybe megan could teach her to go through the walls .	They could all escape .	and
3	124961	I 'd say i have things .	That 's the worst my newfound nemesis can do .	if
2	87044	She tried to hold back so she didnt kill any of them .	There was no way to be certain she hadnt .	but
2	65827	Hell , he could have a rock-solid guarantee of walking away free .	He 'd be damned if he 'd betray his brethren just to save his own neck .	but
3	123440	Why should he have it .	A man can not protect what he has .	if
2	15510	He was a middle-aged man with a face older than his age .	Striving to look younger .	but
4	29635	The old man pushes .	Joe pushes the old man a second time .	when
2	17641	That had interrupted what could have been a long night of very satisfying passion .	Was now going to be a night of hell as he thought about what might have been .	but
2	24625	Disaster and failure loomed .	Towering over everything else was doom ; his , patroclus and the entire human races .	but
4	134447	As quickly abandoning them .	It no longer needed them .	when
2	36716	`` i have met a good many fleas , and . '' .	They tend not to be respecters of persons , let alone of purity .	but
3	35826	Not , i suppose hendricks mused .	You know my life .	if
2	33803	She tried to shrug him off .	He tightened his grip around her bicep .	but
3	23257	Be here with the big bidders .	You havent got the money .	if
1	154771	So kim was pleased in a way , since she has to get up for work these days and she does not want to be living next to party central any longer .	It meant that now she could maybe get the joint closed .	because
2	152181	He had sent her a message telling her not to worry and not to visit , that he was using all the magic he could to save raphael and could not be disturbed .	He knew it would not keep her away .	but
3	48468	And , it was possible that the outlaw might try to use dewitt as a hostage to force parkman to come out in the open and surrender .	He followed bramwell on up the tunnel .	if
4	82045	I sighed and reached for a makeup remover cloth .	I saw just how much damage i 'd caused from our kisses .	when
1	146827	Whatever 's wrong between us , i want to get over it . '' .	I 'd like to get serious with you .	because
3	152351	That i 'm not sure .	I want to kiss him or slap him .	if
4	80479	Im patting myself off .	He reaches down and runs his finger on a small scar on my stomach .	when
2	121198	K kept the key hidden .	Clipped the pen to his shirt breast pocket .	but
2	55478	The bribery of two hundred thousand kept me glued to the chair like a puppet , and .	His mystery kept me from hating him .	but
0	138867	He pushed the covers .	Sat up in bed .	and
0	135286	His mother took in another man who abused her , and that is what gedric learned , to take what you require in life through violence and never to consider the feelings of others .	Beat him this man had no empathy .	and
3	5995	That would make them polite .	They did and still worked .	if
0	158154	He opened the door .	Hopped out , waiting to help me down the small steps .	and
0	656	Tavi blinked up at her .	Then stuffed his arms into the sleeves .	and
2	47602	Of course , it 's been thirty years since she last squeezed into couture .	She still tries , bless her .	but
3	117304	It might just be worth any hardship .	He would look at delilah with tenderness .	if
0	90362	Lucivar abandoned his chair .	Stretched his back and shoulders .	and
0	105978	`` i like him , '' the noblewoman said , pointing at beldin with one hand .	Dipping out more ale with the other .	and
0	92199	Instead , bram pushed him .	Forced everyone else out of her space .	and
0	50726	With a surge of energy , eph propelled the first officer 's body back into its chair .	Got to his feet .	and
3	148663	You cant be a partner in a law firm .	You dont have a phd .	if
2	73539	Serinae whispered in her ear soothing words , i felt a little guilty that we may have caused memories to have returned to narny .	They would have been good memories im sure .	but
2	134429	Sam was sitting on the floor , leaning against his bed with his eyes closed , listening to the music , far away from this room .	He opened his eyes when i shut the door behind me .	but
2	139260	He can kill her if he wants .	She 's not going to go down without a fight .	but
2	159853	I 've arrived at the restaurant , and there is no spencer .	They 've shown me to our table .	but
0	116370	He narrowed his eyes .	Said , i definitely will .	and
0	35177	Kat ran down a path , live that way and be happy .	Shouted over her shoulder , at least .	and
3	151576	He off handedly said to basil .	There were no chance of our being called as light bearers , why would the dark magician be interested in us .	if
0	98195	It was just the one time .	Was nothing but a quick f**k. in fact , i was wasted that night . .	and
2	77775	The rules werent the same and .	No one knew that .	but
2	40727	She felt her legs return .	Didnt want to get up for fear that ana would see her and think that she heard them .	but
4	79599	I put theories and worries like that out of my mind .	Van hurries over to me .	when
0	86433	Logan jumped up into the seat .	Threw on his own harness .	and
0	87688	Mom cut the cake .	Passed it out as we opened our gifts .	and
0	116171	She felt the sensation of lips brushing the corner of her mouth .	She touched her lips in wonder .	and
0	8899	Several seconds ticked by before he sighed , shook his head .	Dropped his gaze from mine .	and
0	115782	One arm reached up , started to drag him down into the mess .	Grabbed ski around the ankle .	and
0	23914	Bram caught hold of her waist .	She thought he meant to push her .	and
1	108267	She kept her left side to the camera .	She 'd always told kinley that was her good side .	because
1	16305	Then we have to get ready .	There are only four days left before opening night .	because
0	101876	You may call me asmodeus . '' .	I 'm here to do you a favor .	and
4	48463	Hi , sheriff , i have the photos youve asked for , tom said .	He saw jim come in the front door of the station .	when
2	20354	Her heart is pounding slowly and heavily in her chest .	She feels a rising joy .	but
2	112839	I will get you on board and after that youll be on your own .	Take you to the kitchens .	but
3	132839	Would i try to do something to him or would i just leave .	He just fell asleep sitting .	if
4	144995	He wanted to see her astonishment .	She discovered how profound the pleasure of simple touching could be , the depth and breadth of it .	when
2	92862	I know what a jinx is .	I dont know how it affects the house .	but
0	100910	Then i reached out , clasped daphne 's hand .	Waited for the images to come .	and
2	108743	She wanted to do as bidden , and the others to accompany her , the music would not draw them together as it had done .	First one was not in the music anymore , and she could tell without expressing this that were she to sing .	but
1	146176	Maybe it was , but he was all that luce could look at .	His was the only spot of color on the quad .	because
2	149279	My days were confused .	It felt far more distant than two weeks .	but
0	148042	They crested the hill .	She saw menkaura , cael , and belle .	and
4	41459	To get inside your head .	I am bored with your sick reveries .	when
3	23369	And , it would fuel the fire .	They videotaped themselves in the act of staking a vampire with the poor vamp turning to dust .	if
0	5741	Hard the tree grew above us .	The light spilled across the sea .	and
0	9429	The small round man stood with his feet .	Pressed two balled fists onto his hips , acting the part of being shocked and angry with the state of the watch on the fort .	and
0	115821	She didnt notice when mana closed the door began to read her own book .	Sat down at the table .	and
2	118203	Normally ive got loads of pens .	Dont know where theyve gone .	but
4	130679	I see the way gage 's eyes widen , the sheen of tears in their depths .	Dad lifts the veil and kisses me .	when
2	78575	I apologize for calling you on a saturday .	I have a situation with one of my teachers .	but
2	64228	Zinger spoke slowly at first .	Got quicker and louder as he went on .	but
4	146291	Turning off the lights in the front room and kitchen , she was walking down the hallway to her room .	She heard a thump outside on the front porch .	when
0	37705	As she stared at him , she was white as kleenex .	Shaking in her shoes .	and
0	144576	Lzaro , apparently not satisfied in the least with alejo 's calm explanation , swore .	Then rushed him , slamming into him from .	and
2	124110	He glimpsed a rough outline of a figure in the distance .	When he blinked the grit from his eyes , the figure had vanished .	but
3	105997	We will have to get you a dress .	You plan on going .	if
0	38453	I was walking along the edge of a cliff 'd plunge down , but the red mist in my head was making it hard to concentrate .	Needed to be sharp or i .	and
2	50931	She turned blindly to return to the gallery .	Doing so bumped into a large male form .	but
3	3976	Why did you promise their mothers to introduce their daughters .	You dont know him .	if
0	155789	Low objections came from my right .	I sighed again , hoping khala would walk .	and
2	104539	His aunt marlene was happy with her bequest .	Naturally worried for angie .	but
0	95542	Smeared with brown ointment .	Covered with waxed paper .	and
4	158427	He told her reprovingly that she should be careful what she told the press , because it might come back to sting her .	They finally reached his big-ass truck .	when
1	55150	She had no idea if dr. spock recommended this sort of treatment or .	She had never read him .	because
2	81065	Her room lacked any lights .	It was strongly illuminated by the glow of the lava flow far below the castles precipice .	but
0	62136	Mason fingered her to follow him .	He walked inside , pocket full of cash and a broad smile on his face .	and
0	76303	I beg you will not be alarmed , '' . '' .	Straightening said , `` temeraire , will you lift that boat up , if you please , so the lady may come .	and
2	151182	Far away now rising towards the south the sun , piercing the smokes and haze ; all mordor lay about the mountain like a dead land , silent , shadow-folded , waiting for some dreadful stroke .	Burned ominous , a dull bleared disc of red .	but
0	61308	Gathering her into his arms .	Spinning her around until she was forced to smile .	and
0	141581	Only instead of the magic entering in through your bloodstream , like you saw happen to lilly , this magic will enter through your oxygen .	Happen more like an internal cleansing than external .	and
0	137838	It had been two weeks since cole disappeared .	Many of the volunteers had given up and gone home .	and
1	12770	Wouldnt have to resort to lying .	He would he had to .	because
3	84399	Do you suppose we 're trying to reach a golf course .	We 're following the symbols for air-jets .	if
2	132012	Jelani waited for a few minutes .	Then impatience got the better of him .	but
2	68332	The inventor always had been more concerned with the pursuits of the mind than the body .	Never before had her lovely green eyes sported such dark circles .	but
0	107025	The black pants that buttoned on the sides were extremely uncomfortable .	They only went to his knees .	and
0	36709	That was the first time i met ul .	The overpowering sense of his presence quite nearly bowled me over .	and
0	128834	I slowly closed my eyes ; it 's a subconscious oasis to the confusion and dread i experienced before the melody .	Enter a peaceful place within my mind .	and
4	1727	He sat up , both his arms going around her and he demanded , `` mouth on mine , baby . '' .	He was close and she was closer .	when
0	87134	Tom found these words less than encouraging , but mo 's expression did not alter .	He threw a quick glance in the badger 's direction looking for a response .	and
0	35199	All she had to do was be patient .	Very soon she could reopen the vault to unleash its magic .	and
2	75353	We know they will never find something wrong .	They will never stop testing .	but
0	7340	He was taking off his coat anyway what the hell was going on .	Gods dont go septic , he grumbled , but .	and
2	89001	I rapidly reversed directions , meaning to dive headfirst into the vegetation , belonging to hodgepile .	Came up instead against a pair of cracked boots .	but
4	113766	He saw that her nose was bleeding .	He lifted her chin with the edge of his hand .	when
0	156105	Ten ava was his , there was nothing he could do about it .	Mckell thought with a frown .	and
0	64015	He looked down at a short table next to a chair in the dressing room area .	Noticed an advertisement flash on the plasma screen affixed to the table .	and
0	62994	Tightly round a squat , stone church .	As they passed , paul found himself gazing with a kind of longing at their drawn curtains and closed shutters .	and
2	3234	She put up a hand to fend him off .	He sank his teeth in just above the wrist .	but
2	115944	The air between us felt almost as empty .	There was just a hint of something .	but
0	37639	When they made a brief halt by a spring .	They gave their feet a rest .	and
4	37474	Everything took on a new sense of urgency .	Jennings , a young man with brown hair and brown eyes , strode into my apartment building .	when
2	54704	I 'd always suspected it would .	The reality , the day to day of it , blew me .	but
0	46195	To make space for the two new arrivals .	I sat down on the grass next to al .	and
2	133629	My brother may be crazy . '' .	He has a few good ideas .	but
4	42331	Cute guys are never just being friendly . '' .	They throw out pickups in the fast-food line .	when
0	110698	Amara took the primitive weapons in hand .	Turned to face the queen .	and
2	63269	There 's another shelter a few blocks over .	My guess is that it 's full .	but
4	6520	I closed the suitcase .	I finally packed the last piece of fabric .	when
2	5043	His hair was turning gray .	It suited him and made him look authoritative .	but
0	90502	The elder did not react to draigs insults .	Simply waited for ironclaw and talon to come up from the lake .	and
3	50300	These woods will be crawling with drow and kobold .	This drow does not get his prisoner to talmal .	if
1	114309	They call us weird and whisper about us .	That 's what jealous biatches do .	because
2	59646	He could not interfere with womens issues .	Maybe he could deflect some of the antagonism that was creeping back into the relationship between the sexes .	but
2	108620	It had rained early in the morning .	The sun came out around noon and instead of drying up the water , had just turned the outdoors into a sauna .	but
3	21873	To find a new ob/gyn out .	She was going to visit jason .	if
4	157973	One thing we dont know is .	These guards are going to attack .	when
4	33441	We were taking advantage of the departing mercenaries .	In truth , we would be creating a diversion of our own .	when
2	107114	They were dressed like locals .	Their bodybuilder physiques and close-cropped haircuts betrayed their true identities .	but
0	157049	A table was burning with a green flame .	The fire licking the nets was beginning to crawl along the ceiling .	and
2	158016	He didnt know the town well enough to score on his own .	He thought about calling his cousin , who was local and had no idea brandon was in town .	but
2	4506	This is a good time to bring up the part about naming him seth and immediately begins to look her over .	Just then jim walks in .	but
2	159563	Learned a right smart from them , too no one could say for sure .	She ran her business as if she had taken business courses , and .	but
2	58368	Glistening against her skin was a fairly spectacular pearl and diamond necklace .	Even more notably for dan , her dress was a black , narrow formal gown that exposed her shoulders .	but
3	83692	I 've changed and you 've changed , and we need to have some rules . '' .	We are going to be able to spend time together like this .	if
3	81626	It was out of some sort of obligation .	He felt anything for her .	if
2	155657	Eleonora had to sell most of the jewellery .	Had kept the emerald set for a special day .	but
0	30805	Just go now , let them help you .	Be with isis and anchille .	and
0	116294	Every person who passed through his estate was scrutinized .	Stripped of all weapons .	and
2	118826	Eamon was still angry .	He held himself silent while she talked .	but
2	144836	She tried to wipe the emotion off her face .	Feared that she was failing .	but
2	85373	He tried to insist that i come home with him .	I refused to be a burden to him or to gram .	but
3	67804	I can give you a call .	I come across anything .	if
1	152258	When id get my exit visa and he said id need to come back in a couple more days .	We were booked to leave in ten days time .	because
0	130392	Sadeas was responsible for the wound .	Was also the one who had forbidden the surgeon 's hall to give supplies to bridgemen , slaves , and servants of the lesser nahns .	and
0	134801	They went to the grand ole opry .	Saw the titanic exhibit .	and
2	85321	Art would never have admitted it .	He actually quite enjoyed choosing what luke was going to wear for the day .	but
4	56372	Maybe he 'd lose interest .	The thrill went out of the chase because there was no chase .	when
0	64249	Then , the plate would come .	All of the guards would have a shot at her .	and
0	114953	She 's called me lilly since year seven .	She gets you mixed up with cynthia , of all people .	and
0	56598	Kira could feel his eyes on her as she paddled closer , but kira knew she had to try to show him something about her that he hadnt already assumed .	Maybe she was being too self-assured or was too pressed by the anger he had sparked in her .	and
3	19128	Let it out . '' .	You 've got something on your mind .	if
2	14839	That may be true .	Two of you will die instantly if you decide to fight .	but
0	19795	She kicked out broke free .	Connected with the man 's groin .	and
2	126915	To the female members , those who were not wives were scholars and , she seemed to possess an obvious aversion .	Had powers of their own .	but
2	20176	The green fork ran swift and deep .	The freys had spanned it many centuries past and grown rich off the coin men paid them to cross .	but
2	75286	You may see for yourself .	I will swear to you that it is , indeed , your unlamented mr. bishop .	but
0	105199	Sprang up , pulling out a wine glass from the correct cupboard and handing it to him to fill .	Joined him in the kitchen .	and
0	92550	Nykyrian pulled thia against him with his free arm .	Placed a kiss on the top of her head .	and
4	90327	Looking over the thick lens at cynder .	Winifred walt opened her door she adjusted her glasses on the tip of her nose .	when
0	27100	The door handle turned .	He watched as the door opened soundlessly and his mother peeked .	and
2	45053	Me and my folk 'll keep watch tonight ; . ' .	You had best get some sleep , if you can .	but
2	144706	All right , rowena told us what she 's going to miss about us .	What are we going to miss about scotland .	but
0	145791	He still trusted her to protect him .	That was all she needed to know .	and
0	97177	He anchored the gun at his back , head bowed .	Flattened his palms on the velvet-lined table .	and
4	143164	Some of the anger inside him simply blew .	His vision focused on judy 's signature .	when
1	132425	Where people are unhappy .	You/he/she can not die .	because
2	11143	The night had been another long one , well over twenty hours of darkness .	Once the sun did come up , it crept slowly upward on a straight arc across the sky , the wandering , drunken course of the day before was gone .	but
1	50091	I stopped listening after the first ten words .	My mind was preoccupied with something unimaginably horrific that i 'd learned only three minutes prior to my parents ' arrival .	because
0	82007	Can i call you ? '' .	Play it over the phone to you .	and
2	122752	She wanted to get out from under his touch .	He moved closer , his body pressing against her shoulder .	but
4	55223	Getting a chip on your shoulder before you 've even seen how bad it can be , what the world can do to you ... seems to me , that 's just foolish thinking . '' .	It really sets its mind to it .	when
0	81182	Pharmacy was not for him .	Transferring to wesleyan university ( ct ) , where he began writing .	and
4	79280	Billys eyes were as big as baseballs .	The pain registered to his brain .	when
0	72307	To kick the world .	Make it speed up .	and
4	27640	More hot wind coursed through her black hair ; disappearing all at once only to reveal a landscape made in hell .	She noticed the fiery walls of the garage disintegrating .	when
4	142516	His eyes cut to me .	I turned to him and opened my mouth to speak .	when
2	31247	Constable petra was starting to get a little nosy , and .	I suppose that was her job .	but
0	62448	When everyone had a drink in hand , the orchestra stopped playing .	A hush slowly fell over the crowd .	and
0	106291	An evil force would appear to attack .	Be right in the path we have to travel .	and
3	64752	I would allow you to be excused but , for reasons i can not explain , you would be doing me a very great favor .	My intentions were of a simple nature .	if
0	60619	In a palace room with no windows , the orb would shine its crimson light .	Together they would both be transported to other worlds .	and
0	155353	Helping others starting a family .	Spending more time with his wife .	and
3	6333	Had enough memories embedded in it , then it could radiate those feelings , sort of like an aura .	An object had enough emotion tied to it .	if
2	89554	... '' i stopped , not wanting to admit the gossip .	He was a step .	but
0	94935	She poured tea , setting the cup down in front of patsy .	Added a little milk .	and
2	44256	The scalbie was investigating brutha 's toes .	Its explorations were interrupted when a tortoise jaw closed around its foot .	but
2	945	Kathy wanted to believe in john .	She had to admit her growing doubts were becoming harder to deny .	but
4	66797	He was staring at them .	He heard a soft footstep behind him .	when
2	142913	She had never been on the receiving end of gabriel 's wrath .	He and her uncle lucian were legendary vampire hunters .	but
4	133959	So he continued they were a very peaceful people .	Our people first came to earth .	when
0	26040	Jasons drink down hard .	Poured more ale into talons tankard from a pitcher .	and
0	143898	She arranged the branches into two parallel rows .	Occasionally glanced up at the doorway .	and
3	112301	He 'd hurt them real bad .	Vincent was to find them .	if
2	36937	When it came to the point even the quiet one was efficient enough , and .	We got the picture up and arranged the curtain over it within the hour .	but
2	159842	They came to the clearing where the clubhouse had been .	Now there was no clearing here at all .	but
2	53834	I tried my best to not let it get to me .	Dammit , i was curious who he was always talking to on that thing that made him smile .	but
2	143139	His shocked expression almost ruined her moment .	She kicked him under the table and ignored his wince .	but
4	74639	You dont need that on your conscious kol .	He pulled the dagger it would have forced you to kill him to survive .	when
0	52482	Merlin looked about with his sight .	Found several of the creatures inside the cottage .	and
1	73924	I had to reach the bank and find the other survivors my father had heard .	I was responsible for more than just myself .	because
2	104759	Hed bring it over , if that was okay she hadnt responded to that phone message either .	She knew the time was coming when she would .	but
0	8669	There was a fluting tone .	The elevator door opened .	and
2	7574	The man holding her was the one i had seen in my dreams , and she was slipping from his grip .	He was doing his best to keep her upright .	but
0	70498	She plucks a long-stem match from the mess in front of her .	Tries to apply it as lipstick .	and
4	32606	We 'll always belong to each other .	It comes to me and you .	when
2	52963	I have you beaten and . ' .	Jack 's got a long trip ahead of him tomorrow .	but
4	33479	My bitterness broke for an instant .	I saw him embrace them .	when
0	55459	In front of her , the great stone slabs among the trees rippled as if they were water .	The pool tipped and splashed from its banks .	and
1	84674	In fact janet shared a room with her mother , and her brother shared one with her father .	They had only two bedrooms and it wasnt proper for janet and her younger brother to sleep in the same room .	because
3	17342	Sebastian i swear to god , i will kill you myself .	This is some sort of trick .	if
0	10130	I took a deep breath .	Dragged my eyes from the desperate woman at the table .	and
2	32955	Joey expected her to protest , or she didnt .	Ask why he couldnt talk about it .	but
3	69321	We need to at least start warning everyone else that they might have to flee now that flee .	Even we cant get harry and the others out .	if
2	136196	I 'm sorry , mcgill said . '' .	You 're going to have to come down to the station with me .	but
3	121359	Now , this is a fact of life .	We design something at all complicated , then no matter how carefully we design it , there will be problems with it , which can only be discovered in practice .	if
4	97275	My dad loved the place . '' .	He was in college .	when
3	139406	I wonder ? '' .	It will make him bigger , like it says in the spam .	if
0	18159	She knew when she was coming home .	She had to say no .	and
0	128889	I lay my hand over his chest s all the way down to the lip of his jeans .	Create a soft letter .	and
0	99109	Lizzie patted the dog on the head .	Went back into the house .	and
0	56327	She looked around , spied on .	Felt as though she were being watched .	and
0	60551	Breedlove brushed past her brother .	Held open the kitchen door .	and
2	8096	Oh yeah , brother , i see you 're pissed .	It was the only play you two gave me .	but
2	147935	I noticed a subtle ripple of revulsion pass through him .	He fought through it .	but
4	43737	He threw the door open before the limo even came to a complete stop , scooped angelica up into his arms and climbed out of the vehicle .	They finally reached his familys home .	when
0	3982	His goal was to take over a neighborhood without anyone realizing it but a few of his own people .	He had accomplished this many times .	and
4	67940	What todd had meant .	He said that he wouldnt want to tangle with rafe .	when
1	46739	No doubt . '' .	Sam wants lots more children .	because
0	140185	Grabbing hold of her jacket .	Throwing her roughly against the wall .	and
3	111603	The world seemed frozen for an instant .	As the sound of the shot had turned everyone within hearing to stone .	if
2	79139	Mia and i wondered the same thing .	We can try it out with johnny tonight , when we escort mckell to air headquarters .	but
2	132952	The festive season was always a very special time of year for the family .	This year was extra special .	but
0	103597	He wiped the rain from his eyes and mouth with a cold wet hand .	Then he said , `` you 're a fool , boy .	and
0	27144	In silence , kian emptied my backpack .	Filled it with the things he 'd gotten .	and
3	147715	However well have much more comfortable thanksgiving dinners .	You take my deal .	if
0	27870	As she sipped her latte and i chugged sweet tea like it was a college drinking game , we chatted about our classes .	Then i finally made myself do it .	and
0	12830	Then rolled up to the desk .	Beat out a fast rhythm on it with his hands .	and
2	64449	She was again tempted to ditch the jacket .	At this point , her blouse was slightly damp , and the last thing she wanted to expose was her lacy bra , so she 'd just have to suffer in silence .	but
0	111862	He took a deep breath .	Climbed in beside melissa .	and
4	42204	If there was such a thing , toby must have been daydreaming , because he 'd never seen it .	The sweet , sensitive side of brad appeared in public .	when
4	105926	Then , i just went nuts for .	I got passed over for the head coaching job .	when
2	50029	She was pretty sure that there would be bumps along the road .	She was grateful to have gotten through this day without behaving .	but
2	108493	I 'd volunteer her services .	I 'd like my nephew to live to see another day .	but
2	58776	I know you 're coming on monday . '' .	Grant and some of the others are planning to take a vote over the weekend .	but
4	73890	I saw cody and casey standing in the doorway to our bedroom , watching me .	I wiped my eyes .	when
0	24976	To do everything in our power to stop hartmann .	To take this secret to our graves .	and
2	122528	Daisy just smiles and waves goodbye to the guy and .	Comes over to us .	but
0	124929	In the south they encountered the dwarves .	Established a tenuous friendship , broken here and there by petty skirmishes and wars , but for the most part profitable for all parties .	and
3	38932	I knew the danger .	Even he did n't . .	if
1	156407	No one ever listened to him .	He always acted like a substitute teacher so everyone acted up .	because
0	91050	The guards around us fell to their knees .	Covered their heads with their arms .	and
2	93404	She was trying to look older .	The caked makeup and sickly saunter had the opposite effect , evoking the blind loftiness of a teenage prostitute .	but
3	126285	Then he was playing some kind of game , which in the worst case could mean that he was involved in the murders .	Blomkvist had lied about the attack on lundagatan .	if
4	87537	My mind raced back to that day a month .	I had wandered into lebay 's garage to look at the car while arnie went into the house with the old man to do the deal .	when
4	60048	That was , realizing that explanations were only making things worse .	We ... '' jonathan stumbled to a halt .	when
2	118864	Before naman apprehended me , i had considered suggesting to galloran that i join you . '' .	I worried that he might object to my presence here at such a sensitive time .	but
4	20738	`` you never know . '' .	You 'll need such an unlikely ally .	when
4	70930	I 'll consider dating .	I 'm at a good point in my career .	when
2	53204	Just looking like their parents .	Locked into the same mannerisms .	but
0	76072	The bomb is strong .	The detonation takes place near .	and
1	57283	Then it 'll suck , you needing to break your promise . '' .	You 're not spending the night .	because
0	143343	To break from dena nehele .	Join us as part of shalador nehele .	and
2	151019	His entourage generally was much larger .	Tonight he did not want to attract attention to himself .	but
3	13018	Then again how could i have lost it .	I never really had it .	if
3	98653	I would draw attention to myself .	I raced into the middle of the fray .	if
0	145969	`` i 'll be right back , '' she threw out .	Then ran after him .	and
0	88173	To yell at him .	Tell him to go stuff himself .	and
3	10910	It 's wonderful , and although logan misses you as terribly as you miss him , he wants to see you happy . '' .	You land in the right place .	if
2	108433	We know ricky will never be normal .	We want him to have a safe and secure life .	but
4	144314	Her eyes are rimmed with tears .	She looks up at me .	when
3	6800	Had no idea whether she 'd been a runner in group b 's maze or whether she 'd remember the layout as well as he did .	It was even the same .	if
4	48998	Well , i felt bad chasing her .	She was only chasing someone else herself .	when
2	160654	She pursed her lips .	This gave way to a smile , which finally turned into a helpless laugh .	but
4	84921	She 'd played matchmaker , or personal stylist , or my personal publicist .	She 'd put together a press conference in front of the house .	when
3	42341	It would be safer , but if whitney manages to put another spy in place and finds out , he conceivably could use a microchip against us .	We had a way to track any child he kidnaps .	if
0	78970	Who appeared to understand .	Had more sense than mere toys .	and
0	152971	She yelped on herself .	Jumped back spilling coffee on the floor .	and
2	75053	Thanked him words could not express what she had really felt .	She looked at him and .	but
0	32883	I am the manager of this nightclub , explained the nightclub manager .	If you can answer some questions for me , i might be able to introduce you to him .	and
3	157734	Finding out for myself .	Even it is too late .	if
2	130974	He and his people looked worse off than teeg and i .	Then they 'd walked through blackened fields and burned jungle to get back to the plantation .	but
2	88301	From a distance , magic dog appeared ghostly white .	Technically , he was considered gray .	but
3	127053	Practically feeling his love for her vibrating through the air .	Even his features were still hard .	if
0	103094	Her fathers face flushed .	He looked towards the door , as if expecting to see his wife enter at any moment .	and
0	90851	She moved in front of rourke , caressing it as she pressed one cheek to it listening for something .	Placed her palms on the door .	and
3	157028	It can see us .	We can see it .	if
0	12685	Come on , stuart , shred yourself into nothing and then i 'll only whisper to you what i was told .	Come all the way over .	and
2	152658	It came dexterity , only a portion a welcomed portion .	Crept into his extremities and .	but
0	19236	Having abandoned the orchestra .	Playing snatches of various airs in a rather didactic manner for the dragons .	and
0	76405	He wished she would ask for more .	He hated himself for it .	and
2	64490	She wanted to say something .	Was afraid shed say the wrong thing .	but
3	18625	What was going on with my sister .	She 'd gone looking for this erin .	if
4	63095	I saw the red stars .	He went by the boom pod .	when
0	52254	The duck-fuzz on his cheeks was finally becoming a beard .	You might have taken him for a growed man except for the three or four times he passed close to her ( once he had come close enough for her to have snaked a hand out and grabbed his ankle .	and
2	103976	High up could they descry the form of the king about the base a serpent of iron spouting flame lashed and rowed with his tail , and balrogs were round him ; and , and dread cries carried up to the watchers .	There was the king 's house in great anguish .	but
3	21607	I 'd do anything to win that from her , to win the affection of my mother 's love .	She were ever to change , if she were to ever tell me she was truly , sincerely sorry and wanted to work on our relationship .	if
2	63642	Nykyrian finally put her down next to his ship .	His right hand stayed firmly on her arm while he holstered his blaster with his left .	but
2	2094	He slapped his legs awake near the table and they did .	Waited for the blood to flow again , to bring them .	but
4	20647	He felt her grip trail .	He was at the absolute end of his strength and ability to resist .	when
2	92485	Used to study at cambridge , so im trying a semester .	I didnt quite find what i was looking for .	but
4	123280	His ghost would be lonely .	They walked out of .	when
2	148482	He 's a bit the worse for wear . '' .	He 's still our boy .	but
3	98574	She certainly wasnt going to go quietly by my hand .	Nymph-girl did plan to follow her man after all .	if
0	154269	I plucked the fat bow off the box .	Placed it on top of owen 's head .	and
2	149254	This time , quinn catches his fist in his large hand and .	Squeezes , forcing gavin .	but
4	92911	'd make her pancakes into the shape of mickey mouse .	She was little i .	when
2	103816	She shot him another look .	He was watching her .	but
3	107988	`` , i could suggest picking her up and driving her to work with me . '' .	You think it 's necessary .	if
0	82600	The dragon blinked in surprise .	Abruptly pushed itself up a bit so that its snout was barely inches from her nose .	and
3	35445	You should ask them .	You can go to grandma 's and take some photos of furble .	if
2	14689	This is bad time for me to say this .	Before i bribe american officials , i must visit toilet .	but
2	118892	Leigh was still holding onto the struts supporting the tyre shelf .	Now she only hung there , head down , dazed .	but
2	101213	I liked the idea of us being alone for a couple days in the wilds of the frozen north .	She had a seminar to cover .	but
2	74220	It can get a little nauseating at times .	I 'm glad she 's happy .	but
2	117100	You americans think you can buy anything with your filthy money ! '' .	You can not buy our soviet soul .	but
2	38680	It 's snowing very hard on the slope that comes up out of the wasteland .	It 's hardly snowing at all down in long-pass .	but
3	138531	She could not blame them .	All they 'd had to eat for the last year was fish - morning , noon and night .	if
4	153282	He rephrases and extends it .	Another minute has passed and no one answers his question .	when
2	120225	He 'd heard about his cousin 's wives getting inked with the mckay cattle brand .	He 'd never seen jessie 's .	but
2	151666	He made it sound as if what meredith was asking was unethical .	She already knew that her father believed in using his power and connections whenever , and wherever , they would benefit his purpose .	but
4	143157	He had a legion of girls surrounding him .	I 'd left the bar last night .	when
4	108366	Who had held firmly to her hand .	Oliver swept her into his hug .	when
4	12766	There was a rope tow .	I last used a bunny hill .	when
0	68992	I know that sounds crazy .	It were one of you telling me this , i would be suspicious .	and
0	155164	I took a deep breath .	Forced a smile on my face as i approached the guard .	and
0	32546	To put inside my shield .	Help keep back the cold .	and
0	159757	Matt jumped off the bed in alarm .	Stared at veronica for the first time as someone , or something that could destroy him .	and
4	138498	To head into the living room .	His mom called his name .	when
2	144064	Verica could use her shadow magic to escape .	Jazlyn would be caught .	but
0	40298	Existence was just a temporary escape .	Now you have awakened into your real life .	and
4	113260	You get a low rashon .	You do something stoopid or just annoy noy .	when
0	122301	To fit one into the lock .	Missing the slot a few times .	and
0	13618	It 's just different .	I fell in love with you with long hair .	and
0	50263	I 've ever met .	I 've taken in the worst scum imaginable .	and
0	138753	Give me a minute to get into position . '' .	We 'll end it .	and
1	125953	Why i knew what you were thinking that night .	I thought the same things myself .	because
0	132477	But that too fell into ruin as the weary knights became distracted from their duty .	The white watcher became dormant , so that its eyes were dulled into slumber .	and
2	129249	The bedroom continued the maroon motif .	Highlights in gray rather than white .	but
2	12628	You 'll probably show up as an unregistered user . '' .	Unless she 's cursed him again , he 's likely looking for her and will answer .	but
4	145218	Bull and kyle had just left to go back down the creek through the canyon to where the two creeks joined .	I arrived with my bundle .	when
3	151714	When you do speak to olivia , i 'd appreciate . '' .	You gave me a few minutes ' notice .	if
0	130111	Natalie opened her eyes said .	Focused in on what lise .	and
4	127876	`` well , last year , i had a new one made .	I went up to canada huntin ' .	when
2	106	Id never seen a vampire .	I knew plenty about them , mostly learned from remy , and my education had taught me that hollywood and fiction writers had absolutely no clue .	but
2	72972	Im not going to fight with you before you leave .	You are exasperating and stubborn .	but
0	73189	Wondered for a terrified moment if valentine meant to stab jace where he stood .	Jace meant to let him .	and
4	80239	Only you had the same reaction .	You first met all those years .	when
3	80453	Do you believe he would flee and deny justice in this matter ? '' .	Mr. blake stone were not in custody .	if
2	17746	I said id let it slide , cliff sneered .	Im gon na have to ask ya to shut yer trap .	but
0	4465	Just crawl into bed .	Try to blink my way out of existence by way of sleep .	and
0	78663	He 'd seen paranormal interrogations before .	He knew just how intense they could become .	and
3	125259	How can you tell .	Anything has been moved in that sea of candy wrappers and empty water bottles .	if
0	65550	Hollow stretched his skinny legs out in front of him lean to the side .	Watched the tassels on his loafers .	and
4	61607	The last time , the opening of the doors had felt like the breaking of some spell .	They 'd been in this .	when
0	75052	The people love a good show . ' .	That 's what i wanted to give them .	and
0	118563	That defied gravity , a purple necklace .	As i glanced down , i saw a turquoise peasant skirt .	and
4	1960	What i was getting myself .	I asked lauren to drive me home .	when
2	81084	The shadows had grown long from the lowering sun .	She could still see the road leading north , empty of any travelers .	but
0	10347	He then wiped the spot of blood off from where the blade had hit him .	Tasted it in a very telling fashion .	and
0	146095	I take her bag .	We walk into the house .	and
3	107555	We can do it .	Youve always had a dream to own a dragon , or a jackalope , or a unicorn .	if
4	123266	A pang hits my chest , but it 's better than it was .	I step in as i see gramps 's trailer in the corner , and some random old rock music is playing instead of his country .	when
2	92015	Resigned to my plan .	Those plans promptly fizzled once i saw jules sitting at her table all by herself .	but
3	60721	`` , you 'd have my vote for triarch , my lady . '' .	I were volantene , and free , and had the blood .	if
4	118994	Her best chance to make an impression was .	He was suffering from the consequences of his actions .	when
0	125286	He offered the same to ragnar .	After the long day he 'd had he seriously considered having a glass until he saw keita give a very quick shake of her head .	and
3	35596	I guess i 'm wondering .	It was the place or the people .	if
3	150466	She would feel more comfortable .	I had a running partner .	if
0	134732	Separating our two nations .	Throwing us into hatred and suspicion of each other .	and
1	109486	That had to be .	I knew they belonged .	because
3	135870	His lifestyle demanded anyone in his personal sphere succumb to the media attention .	Even she wanted to give a relationship or even an affair with roper a chance .	if
3	132384	They will find it harder to fight .	Their people are poorly supplied .	if
0	49355	The first jerry turned the bend in a flurry of snow .	Came crashing along the last stretch .	and
2	44508	Mels people were grilling them at the time .	Larry expected nothing from them .	but
3	97965	And , it 's that i 'm stubborn .	You 've learned anything about me over the last year or .	if
0	70862	Little use left for that country .	Withdraw back to the hole they came from .	and
3	76408	`` , all you have to do is say please . '' .	You want to come .	if
0	137305	The air whipped across her body , seeing its radiant patterns welcoming her home .	She focused her eyes on the temple window ahead of her .	and
3	156934	We can defend ourselves , or worse .	We are attacked by the animals .	if
2	39883	Not only to uncover darren 's secret .	He was only hiding happiness .	but
2	1043	She 'd once wanted only one night with reyes .	Would now beg for another .	but
1	8789	I nearly draw a blank on the three non-related sources .	The first person to come to mind is graham .	because
0	86981	He had dedicated the next several years to his fighting skills in the same way he had once dedicated himself to his books .	After five years he had returned to ilaadris as a talon .	and
0	41722	`` i 'll be back in a few minutes , '' said sofia from the porch .	She ambled inside , closing the door behind her and leaving us .	and
2	7658	Art and painting had captured his early childhood dreams .	They had long vanished , lost on another road in the wilderness of his fantasies .	but
4	38286	What birds feel like all the time .	They hang around in the big old trees out in the garden .	when
2	11309	She didnt like the analogy .	It was the first one that came to mind .	but
2	5116	She looked up at him , startled .	Before she could say anything , he was kissing her , kissing her with such fervor that there was no longer any doubt in her mind about their relationship .	but
1	143900	When she felt that the two of them - arnie and christine - were welded together in a disturbing parody of the-act of love .	There were times ( like tonight , as arnie skated the plymouth so smoothly and delicately across the building scales of sleet .	because
4	82070	`` , the invitation to her wedding was in my mail . '' .	I got home to look after mins .	when
1	54429	It 'll probably be sensei akira .	She 's the scariest .	because
0	53320	I declare this town council meeting over and done with .	We are all dismissed .	and
3	22293	He could possibly fix her heart problem , but what would such an exchange do to an unborn infant .	He gave her his blood .	if
0	33056	Gregor opened up the compartment on his hat .	Found it ran on some special rectangular battery .	and
4	46443	And the years had also taught him .	To be furious with himself over his own carelessness .	when
4	125166	For him they dropped it .	They allowed women onto the force .	when
3	86347	Cindy , nick we 're going to wait until sheen gets back to leave .	You can hear me .	if
4	143207	She saw the faint glow on her skin .	She lifted her hand to the stair railing .	when
3	10873	Then i 'm on somebody else 's turf and there 's a fight .	I move an inch or two .	if
1	88233	She took her carving out in the tiny backyard .	It was still light outside .	because
0	18707	He was feeling more and more left out .	Had no idea what to make of his sister 's clothing .	and
0	106022	Lively chatter and the unmistakable scent of fish wafted up into the bedroom on the second floor of mr. ashinoyubis home .	Aroused tomika out of slumber .	and
0	69941	Uncle beldin left on some mysterious errand .	So my education fell on the twins ' shoulders - at least they thought it did .	and
0	43987	Beth stared at ember .	Earned a wave from the redheaded woman in her car .	and
3	14668	Centuries of careful coexistence could be wiped out in an instant . '' .	Enough hysterical humans were to scream the word `` vampire .	if
3	23394	I 'd say shame on you for flirting outrageously with another one of your clients . '' .	I was going to do that .	if
0	80592	Leto put his arms around her .	She put her hands on his chest .	and
0	40945	The other guy had on a dust shirt .	Was busy scribbling notes .	and
2	71952	It is not you .	It is a blow to sir gilbert that he desires .	but
2	76544	Not just i was her shield .	I was her boy .	but
2	138574	I must be mad . '' .	That 's what i want to do .	but
2	9460	She took a step .	He stepped with her .	but
0	108926	Said he just saw a woman jump off a three-story building .	Then the woman just walked away without a scratch .	and
2	63315	They managed to do very much .	Then a week would go by so quickly with one day blending into the next with no memories to show for it .	but
0	95663	A map of brittany is spread out .	Small , colored pebbles are scattered across it .	and
2	7262	I know this is going to sound silly ? '' .	Why did you bring the dress .	but
3	124060	There was always retaliation .	Either of us was mistreated .	if
1	69413	When we were seventeen .	He died . '' .	because
2	64750	That had done nothing brought her trouble .	She 'd tried to run from her feelings before , and .	but
0	150676	`` they 're new recruits at headquarters . '' .	Helped me bring the vamps .	and
3	68137	Seven times seven men , then i may lead you .	Such things do not daunt you .	if
0	88169	Gathering the magic around her .	Imbuing everything she did with its force .	and
2	53110	Well , thorne is dead .	I already told you that , schlocky said .	but
4	160470	To offer her hand .	She knew he was so afraid .	when
2	139366	It was night over america , so there werent too many creeps .	Practically only shamans do magic .	but
2	51378	Dupuis offered them a bed for the night .	Violet was adamant she return to marseille and her mother .	but
3	63440	Tell me , i beg you .	You know what god wants for me .	if
2	92155	I came back to retrieve the pages , too . '' .	Then i was told you were coming for them .	but
0	49728	Coyote curled his lip .	Gestured to the injury on his own leg .	and
2	35695	The trip would take all day .	He had nowhere else that he would rather be .	but
4	113063	He decided that the service staff had wangled an extra day through their union and that the smell would still be there the next day .	Charlie left the department along with the secretaries at four-thirty .	when
2	71154	Birth were active and alive .	With a concentrated will , were slowly being eclipsed by that one beautiful feather , crystalline in the darkness .	but
4	30287	He led maneck back into the underbrush to wait for some unsuspecting animal to happen by .	At last ramon had the snares in place .	when
0	151105	She had already moved out of his reach zane seemed reluctant to get any closer to cassie .	Zane tried to grasp anastasia , but .	and
0	48773	The quivering returned to her limbs .	She was grateful for the hard plastic beneath her .	and
3	72101	Then he has to do the second to get back on good terms with me .	A man does the first .	if
3	14164	Being cooped up in the dark and disheartening shadow district under embers constant watch to going out into the light .	Even it was for the witch , had filled him with the nostalgia of having lived in a simpler , brighter time .	if
0	117188	Is being outside the roundhouse .	Something seized me ... oengus .	and
0	138989	The distraction allowed silus to get closer still slash at the beasts scaly neck .	Again thrax swung his head out of the way with a mighty roar , but .	and
2	6942	Which always tasted so mild .	Provided a heady kick .	but
0	24396	More than twice as big as the moon in midgard , thought odd .	He wondered if that was because asgard was closer to the moon , or whether it had its own moon .	and
2	156720	Did she have nowhere to go .	Even if she tried , she 'd never be able to hide out .	but
0	50070	Nearly three hundred years ago , powerful witches gathered together to call for the spirit of the phoenix .	Placed it within a human body .	and
0	60610	Her muscles are cramping .	Her mind is blank .	and
2	72624	'' i said , `` . '' .	I 'm not ready to talk about it .	but
0	137575	She clung to him .	Her skin was cold even though she was soaked with sweat .	and
3	20988	You only could catch on .	You really know the person .	if
0	41828	The darkness gives like grudging , soft taffy : ka-twannnggg .	Then lets go with a sensation like the snap of a rubber band .	and
0	70241	I put down gabes psp .	Look out the window .	and
0	150387	So he scrambled along the sidewalk to the back of the van .	Looked around the vehicles tire .	and
2	16230	I am going to need a hint or .	This is going to bother me all day .	but
2	117818	He 'd kept their names and phone numbers not a single woman to compare to the one he 'd met yesterday , quite by chance .	There were a couple he might 've liked under other circumstances , and .	but
4	71760	He would be free of reminders of kira , breaking the strange , hypnotic sway her memory seemed to hold over him .	He was free of this house .	when
0	66431	The voices of the men were already between he the horses .	Cutting him off from gaining a speedy escape .	and
0	35608	Ailia closed her eyes , realizing he was currently her only safeguard against danger .	Squeezed herself closer to volomites large body .	and
4	90453	She slept with that granger boy .	She was only sixteen .	when
2	126228	They had to upgrade all her major mechanical and electrical components .	They maintained and restored her original and luxurious dcor and accommodations .	but
1	67930	... you know ... shoes .	Iceland is a hard place to live without .	because
3	105741	Thomas ... it is not by coincidence .	This thing was after us .	if
0	116016	A crown was laid on his head .	He was seated on a throne , and a man clad in black pulled the throne from under him and set it ablaze .	and
2	77044	There was a metal grate fence to keep the tourists away from the water .	Mari was still small enough to squeeze under it .	but
3	120411	Know that you will not kill me before i can drive this blades edge all the way through your lovers neck .	You are behind me .	if
2	153076	I might be a big-time , rich lawyer .	Don still saw me as the poor kid looking for a chance .	but
2	30254	Dan looked ready to argue .	Matt quieted her with a touch on her arm .	but
0	37420	People will see ilsa .	Wonder is that she is a distant cousin of my ilsa 's , widowed , and her parents have recently been lost .	and
2	134241	That was the case at one time , do not worry you will be fine just announce yourself the moment you cross the border .	Since then i have promised them land in return for their help and reluctantly they agreed .	but
2	51413	If anyone shows their face above that rail , have the first rank fire . '' .	Have the second rank hold back , in case they think to shoot at us as we reload .	but
3	37169	To get you a little more competent with battle .	Youre going to be of any use to us .	if
4	54761	Her confidence continued to grow ; he 'd always been gentle and undemanding .	He kissed her again and .	when
0	160037	James turned his head .	Kissed suzanne 's temple .	and
4	68203	My brow pinched in concern .	I saw the never-used percolator on the counter beside the sink .	when
4	133901	To lighten the mood .	They most needed it .	when
2	150656	Lucas and sean were absent while kevin and tate sat with them .	Continued to stare at where rebecca sat in the corner .	but
2	37871	The night was warm .	A slight breeze kept blowing samantha 's hair into my face .	but
0	7267	A weird groaning noise came out of his throat .	He pushed the prana , the pure energy , out of him and at the astronomer .	and
2	99639	You know its kind of scary at first .	Once you understand why you can walk over the coals .	but
3	141171	Wondered , because if i had , how could i now be back inside the burning hall .	I really had ran .	if
4	115615	You would see it .	She reached for a fork or pushed her plate .	when
2	142662	Normally only an undead vampire could bespell the unwilling .	Being piscary 's scion gave kist a portion of his master 's abilities .	but
0	60381	You allow me to stay on this boat as a member of your team . '' .	I can guarantee you a permit for anything you need .	and
1	56940	What we missed out on .	That little bastard eloped .	because
0	106986	Magic medicines were not like doctors ' medicines .	Flagg knew that one of the reasons the potions he gave the old king were now so slow to work , was that he , flagg , no longer really wanted them to work .	and
2	31354	You 've not had much to smile about in recent weeks . '' .	Tonight i hope to remedy that .	but
3	20798	They may get upset with us .	We refer to them as twin numbers one and two for the rest of their lives .	if
2	156705	The sestian was apprehensive about awarding rasmere the position of sword .	He knew that if he did not honor his commitment , it could have resulted in another revolt by the forest engeniums .	but
4	88511	But , she found it cuffed to the bed .	She tried to lift her arm from above her head and slide it into her wet flesh .	when
3	120463	I doubt . '' .	Falco would hang around now that he 's been discovered .	if
4	25363	Holding out his hand .	I start to protest .	when
3	141899	She 'd have been beaten for even questioning me .	I considered myself a true andarion .	if
0	12791	Adrenalin surged through me .	I felt myself light up like a firecracker .	and
1	152594	I slept with him , because he left adam alone , because he could not begin to question jamess loyalty when james was often the one taking me to and from his room .	He let me see my daughter .	because
3	129016	Us dripping on the carpet .	Even it is looking a bit threadbare .	if
0	22401	He rested the long barrel on the log .	Picked out a target .	and
2	131263	Being here with him .	Not having him around is harder than i thought it would be .	but
2	72206	I know for a fact he and em are back on the platonic track .	He 's been leery of flaunting brielle in her face , so it sort of feels like they 've cooled it .	but
4	160813	The bitterness would be palpable .	They finally realised they had been duped .	when
1	145705	Himself touch the old mans thin , dry skin .	He had read somewhere how important human touch was for everyones emotional health .	because
0	138226	Both had been stuck behind desks most of the time .	Were exhilarated about going into the field .	and
0	27257	Canute reached out , pressing until he felt the racing beat of tostis heart against his palm .	Put his hand against tostis chest .	and
0	73374	Sue slowly unzipped her dress .	Let it fall to the floor .	and
0	66561	Leaning over the boy , i carefully flipped him over .	Stared at his unseeing eyes .	and
4	109428	I heard him remark to kenya that he figured arlene had been strangled .	The coroner came to pick up the body .	when
3	134916	I thought he was absolutely correct .	That was appius livius 's conviction .	if
0	359	He wanted manifold pressure ( mp ) at 30 .	That beautiful radial engine had to obtain a minimum 2300 rpms .	and
0	120976	Step into the circle .	When i cast a diagnostic charm on your magic , i found only the barest traces as if your will had escaped your body .	and
2	95457	It may be the algorithm i 'm working on . '' .	The odd inscription on the inside of the ring appears to me to be like the ridges of a key .	but
3	1999	I will end up killing him .	He chooses to be my enemy .	if
1	134627	If they spoke to you it was .	They wanted to mess with you .	because
2	97618	They 're so good , better than everyone .	None of them gave a shit about others .	but
2	148730	It was nearly enough to bring tears to her eyes .	She had cried already and now was not the time .	but
0	134038	My friend is supposed to interview the new students .	Your name is on her list .	and
3	97730	What would she do .	They decided not to adopt her baby .	if
2	158073	Since we got back to st. louis , '' added cat grove , `` you been talkin ' nothin ' .	Gettin ' back your boat .	but
4	147929	Who you choose to be .	You let your guard down and leave it all on the streets .	when
2	88187	The three of us chatted while she worked .	Carley was there we didnt have a chance to talk about anything related to fairies or mrs. cheshire or princes .	but
2	21821	It would be lonely there in venice , with no one but verbena and oliver with her , and aunt eustacia , of course .	She would not be living with her aunt .	but
0	20238	Okay , chance was a vampire .	That was undeniably a large relationship hurdle .	and
2	10497	I tried to fight against them .	They were like two brick walls .	but
0	58370	Her fingers accidentally let go of the windowsill .	She fell , landing with a thump on her butt .	and
3	142265	Clutching the mane of a flying pegasus , well , awesome .	I go on to glory .	if
2	149555	In that case , the fbi wants to keep up with the witness .	They do it through us .	but
2	41823	She pulled her hand .	It was shaking from the mix of emotions rushing through her .	but
2	87107	It was not his fault .	The report would reflect badly on him all the same and he could ill afford another black mark on his career .	but
0	119489	Then it spun off in a totally different direction .	Showed me the face of the woman id seen on jacobs .	and
2	66698	Tara laughed and her thoughts were held hostage by those disturbing words .	Shawna tried to say something else witty .	but
0	116934	Anyway , continued allison , we will be going through tucumcari in the next couple of hours .	I see on the map that the interstate by-passes the downtown now , i would at least like to get off and drive down old route 66 that goes through the heart of the city .	and
0	96493	She turns to me .	Said while pointing at alyse , it was mostly the little she-devils doing , i turn to alyse , impressed , you .	and
2	42107	Okay , i am so not doing the marrying thing , and thanks .	Children are definitely not in my future plans .	but
2	97505	I wanted to bolt down the aisle and vault onto the stage .	Logic told me it was a trap .	but
3	141318	She believed she could figure out how to drive the truck .	Forrest would let her .	if
4	153705	Feeling woozy even though she was lying down .	She sensed someone beside her .	when
0	76561	Laurence would have liked to unburden himself plainly to riley ; as it was - `` perhaps , '' hammond put in , hurriedly , `` captain laurence is concerned that they might irritate the dragon .	If hammond had not been there , he would have done .	and
0	28175	She became used to the heat she relaxed was , for the first time since she had tumbled from the sky , utterly happy .	Initially the water was indeed too hot , but .	and
0	75794	Reuben stood a full head taller than eduard , so a light cuff from reuben had been enough to send eduard tumbling into the pond he had just complained about .	Outweighed him by a least double .	and
2	122966	Hywel hadnt brought his knives .	Gareth wasnt going to test his luck by asking for them .	but
0	90585	He stood up and we strolled out of me garden .	Put his arm around me .	and
4	38770	Where were you going .	You fell in the river .	when
2	156714	Call it her competitive nature , or her will to survive .	All she knew for sure was that she had to make it in seattle 's business world - in a business not involving sex - and byron knight had a lot of wealth that she wanted a piece of .	but
3	44621	He needed some reminding in the art , for the girl was correct .	He was to truly behave a gentleman .	if
3	151125	But , i 'd never get out of bed in the morning . '' .	I let it take over .	if
3	1867	To `` kick some ass '' .	The show was disappointing .	if
4	48834	`` i 'm glad you came over , '' jase says .	We reach the end of the driveway .	when
2	27003	The good stuff does .	I 'm not in the mood to correct him while he 's so jolly and light .	but
1	103303	He 's done this to other kids .	Too he works with kids .	because
0	103268	Tipping her head back , she put the vial to her lips .	The contents were gone in a heartbeat .	and
2	142749	No one is really sure how it works .	When you 're changed to a martis , it 's a process .	but
1	55763	At one point i almost started a brawl , we were only gone for a minute and by the time i got back to the table some sweaty metal head was trying to press up on shaw .	I had gone to the bathroom and nash had slipped out to smoke .	because
3	23468	They shared this glorious planet with your son .	Even it was for a short time .	if
3	47989	At least to see .	There really was anything in common in .	if
0	65701	You have a heartbeat .	You bleed , not to mention that your skin is warm to the touch .	and
0	91132	They got close to us massive amounts of adrenaline dumped into their systems they started moving more .	Other than the leader and one or two others , this group all moved with an obvious exhaustion , but .	and
1	48850	Your mother is going .	She wants to see to the interests of marseilles .	because
4	86934	The human imagination is often disastrous .	Left to its own devices .	when
2	104410	I dont doubt you found something significant .	I dont see a map .	but
2	82563	At first , i used to put off the reports .	Then it became overwhelming .	but
3	26807	I could eliminate the outlanders and take over all of gorn .	Only i knew the secret of traveling the outlands .	if
0	64634	Gandalf stood before the door of orthanc .	Beat on it with his staff .	and
2	51315	The park used to be the home of every homeless person in the city .	When the city remodeled this part of the downtown area , they kicked the bums out and made this section classy and upscale .	but
3	51952	Three were better , when it came to medicine .	Half a spoon of something was good .	if
4	78217	Was lay her down on the bed and relieve the fierce ache in his loins .	All he really wanted to do .	when
3	1262	More concerned their frocks will get rumpled and soiled .	They lift a finger .	if
2	55144	The gerard might realize that he has been chosen as soon as he meets the essence .	Either way , we will know for sure after the ceremony .	but
0	45240	I do not care with whom she is sequestered or what duties she is performing , i will force a meeting with her .	Find out what rotten core is at the heart of the twisted web she weaves .	and
0	111250	The engine was idling .	She was almost sure the indistinct figure in the driver 's seat was wearing a red baseball cap .	and
2	5861	Jinny looked over their heads into the distance .	He kept their eyes on him and their ears focused out over the water .	but
3	38609	It seem significant in a different way-as .	She had something to hide .	if
4	17210	Everyone writes this differently but we sign .	We are on the same page when we both know what we would consider betrayal when we think we know what the other is capable of .	when
2	62977	I raise an eyebrow .	He says nothing , letting his feet do the talking as we get closer and closer .	but
4	2918	To be available for me .	I finally forced myself to make the time for something other than my job .	when
2	134599	As he neared , the family noticed his approach .	Continued to gather their fruit .	but
0	9033	She glanced up at his face .	He saw her dilemma .	and
2	9047	Zurra fired a needle .	He was surprised when dakkal ducked and rolled perfectly on one shoulder to avoid it .	but
0	9631	To when i was young at night .	Huddled in the cold , white dormitory bed .	and
0	129290	She blew a curl out of her eyes .	Just when he tensed to trace behind her , she took two hands and plunged her sword back along her side to kill the ghoul at her back .	and
0	40796	There were a few people lurking out by their cars .	A girl in a neon pink coat was sprinting like mad for the glass entrance doors of the school .	and
3	23916	I 'm sorry . '' .	I 've insulted you .	if
2	23466	Amaya moved to peer in the hole in the door .	Apollo held her arm to stop her .	but
0	11400	This one thawing out , like that one tried to do last week .	Kicking me in the balls as i slice him up .	and
2	148385	I ran toward my husband to embrace him .	I had been too slow .	but
0	92136	One of the dogs barked .	A man shouted a command .	and
2	58779	Granted shes not the smartest girl in the world .	She stays late and tries hard to keep up with her assignments .	but
2	55019	I open my mouth to speak .	He holds up that damn finger .	but
2	43275	You know im married .	You still want me , dont you .	but
2	141003	My legs were around his waist in the womens bathroom .	I was clinging to him .	but
0	114992	She would not remember him .	She needed the memory of him .	and
0	25093	Continued , `` what i 've seen concerning you is not good .	Turning back to her .	and
1	628	Who arent afraid of punishment .	Right and wrong are just like pleasure and displeasure .	because
0	148757	It was definitely heated poor morfyd was caught in the middle as always , trying desperately to calm the situation .	Because neither female would let the other finish a sentence , fearghus had no idea exactly what they were arguing about , but .	and
2	5165	A few of them are involved in subtle conversation .	The tall one is still just staring at me .	but
2	126872	He closed his eyes and , cursing his god .	For the day he was born , he stood up .	but
2	70284	Cassie was thrown against the seat .	She did not lose her grip on chris 's quivering hand .	but
2	81599	We managed to halt the rift .	We have no way of closing it which means that potentially all kinds of hell could come through it at any time .	but
0	69424	The woman had cooked chicken for that she was his new best friend .	Definitely not as appealing as shelby in short shorts , but .	and
2	38169	I glanced at shaya and rurik .	This time , no help came .	but
0	80869	He returned the necklace to the box .	Replaced it on his wifes dresser .	and
3	82649	I would take you to tend me personally . '' .	Ewan was not such a valued ally .	if
0	157863	Then again , mermaids were real , so she guessed the jury was still out on just how much magic her life had lost as shed grown .	She might have a crush on one .	and
0	12912	Hed never been that into formality .	So he had no qualms about conducting a highly important meeting while sitting down and drinking .	and
2	90558	I missed a few words . '' .	I got the gist .	but
4	102370	Once , another was at the zoo , and then today . '' .	You got your shoe stuck in the sewer .	when
4	140135	As i cried on my bed , i fantasized about sneaking into the mansion like i did with jack patterson .	I was twelve and retrieving the racket .	when
0	151351	He had made his fortune in the indies .	Headed west only when he had drawn too much attention to his activities in the far east .	and
2	75482	I could have compared notes all day .	Ryder was not one of those brain-washed women that would go running back to nix the minute i spilled my guts .	but
2	87574	She was tired after her long trip .	She felt a little better .	but
0	19309	Finn gave roslyn a sidelong glance , more concerned about the stain setting in his jacket than the danger presented by the pissed-off vampire .	Kept trying to rub the barbecue sauce out of his suit .	and
0	70179	Intertwining with my hair .	Tipping my face toward his .	and
0	70841	Standing up , he indicated the passage leading from the room .	Said , shall we .	and
0	11479	She picked up the phone .	Punched in a number .	and
0	37296	The knife came free as she pulled .	Tiffany dropped it in favor of scooting back across the slick floor as far from vera as possible and grabbing at her bleeding shoulder , crying out in pain .	and
3	152632	Why 'd you think it was the same killers ? '' .	The murder weapons and mo and victim selection were so varied .	if
3	4472	You 're either incredibly stubborn , or maybe you 've got something .	You make it through a hundred reads , and of course editing it along the way .	if
3	69327	This was probably the moment .	He was going to die .	if
2	116747	He 's made to rule with an iron .	Stays behind an iron curtain .	but
4	128502	Silva started this war .	I was a baby .	when
2	152778	That really was my real name .	It felt rude to point it out .	but
2	154333	The taste did anything dramatic to his taste buds .	Rather he couldnt sweeten it .	but
0	80195	Maybe he should be selfish .	Keep her with him after all .	and
2	97273	`` we are in dangerous territory either way .	Technically , sinegem has not fired galbraith .	but
3	90548	And , you lose it .	You dont use it .	if
0	893	To take her hand .	Draw her up next to him .	and
1	13409	The more it felt like the labyrinth was endless .	The longer he was inside the thick walls .	because
0	147892	You step upon my transport .	Choose to join me on our new home world .	and
2	50573	We 'd been driving in bright sunshine .	That ended with the hacienda 's wall .	but
2	47767	Now i feel bad i started this .	There 's not much i can do about it .	but
0	146791	Beth suddenly opened her eyes .	Adjusted to the light .	and
0	65766	Sprawled on nehemia 's bed .	Tossed a chocolate-covered raisin into her mouth .	and
0	159027	His destination was behind the hill of rhaenys .	The streets were crowded .	and
4	138364	She relaxed , showing her just how much i liked it .	I reached out and gently tugged a fistful of the material .	when
0	122057	A surrounding mob of gray caps click .	Whistle with insane speed .	and
4	62243	`` , i 'd prefer it if you thought about me . '' .	I 'm holding you .	when
1	114260	But , in a way , she did me a favor .	It hit me that if anything happened to you , really happened .	because
2	105084	Their skulls had been crushed with great force .	Their bodies remained uneaten-killed by a beast of tremendous strength , yet not out of hunger or fear .	but
2	12171	The griffin master selected balkind . ' .	There were none to ride him .	but
0	4088	The poison coating the wasps ' stingers would prove dangerous to the mantis-forms , but their stingers punched through vord chitin with great effectiveness .	Each drew its individual trickle of blood .	and
3	136457	I wouldnt be able to do .	Even it had been jonas .	if
2	118484	He was pale and sweating and he fought it .	He felt that he may throw up .	but
2	11100	I managed to undress and .	Get in between the sheets before i fell .	but
3	2655	I could probably go to him for help , but he was thousands of miles away in amsterdam on some job thing .	Nick were in town .	if
4	13398	But , i had to set her down .	She made her interest known .	when
0	31438	If she had flight capability , she would have levitated straight up into the air beat her to a pulp for daring to touch him .	Ripped lorelei out of quinlan 's arms .	and
1	19341	I got this inside information from myself .	It was me that had done it .	because
2	88334	It took a few seconds for that piece of information to register .	When she listened , madison could hear a car 's engine .	but
4	772	`` i 'm going home , '' i told roff .	I went back to our booth .	when
2	12180	I 'm thinking to myself deb and bradford , sittin ' in a tree .	I resolve to let her tel me about him at her own pace .	but
3	73329	So i figure , well they 'd be more likely to do business with me .	I brought him back and handed him over .	if
0	121469	Instead of short quick strokes , her hand moved slowly went through my hair all the way to the back of my head .	Her free hand brushed through my hair , pushing it away from the cut , but .	and
3	119894	`` now , douglas . '' .	You have a moment .	if
0	8089	`` it 's not your fault , '' he said .	Bumped her with his shoulder .	and
2	98347	She didnt seem scared .	She might just be .	but
4	123321	I ordered him to accompany her and send me regular reports on her well-being . '' .	My sister left for d'albret 's household .	when
2	55720	He roars and not enough to let me get free .	His grip on my hair loosens .	but
0	15889	She slipped between a bus and a panel truck .	Then she was crossing a plaza into central park .	and
2	24809	Rick steeled himself for something .	He didnt know what .	but
2	30185	It was the shortest blip of time .	In it , we 'd been frozen , as if the lives we were supposed to be living played in fast forward between us .	but
0	49716	She took a glance around the room .	Discovered not all the patrons were vampires .	and
2	78716	He looked remarkably like eugene slovensky .	His hair was blonder and he was obviously younger .	but
0	112670	Our school is two floors .	The stairs between the floors have two flights .	and
0	53933	But hey , this ignoring thing just kept on trucking barreled off into the sunset .	Took the corner at a little .	and
2	108527	For a moment , jack and jill stared at me .	When jenks clattered his wings threateningly , they slowly got to their feet .	but
2	49414	A man in a mickey mouse mask and costume strummed a guitar .	He wasnt very good and danny figured he was probably hiding out from someone .	but
3	12834	He would take her .	Dhaalu knew of the girls existence .	if
0	127819	I stumbled to keep up with him can .	Bumped my knee into a garbage .	and
4	113299	`` you look like you 're about to cry , you 're so happy , '' valerie said .	Steffie joined her in the car .	when
2	35259	For work , she would pull her hair .	Today she decided that just blowing it dry so it was soft and fluffy would be a better choice .	but
4	8279	Rob was hanging up his phone .	She knocked on his open door .	when
0	156205	The rate of innovation in magic has also doubled .	Probably more , since a lot of it is being done in secret .	and
2	69534	Regan may have been as unpopular with her teachers as an unscheduled faculty meeting , ( and secretly despised by the girls who envied her nubile figure .	The majority of boys gravitated to her cloying demeanor like roaches to darkness .	but
3	16958	Not it would matter , because every part of last summer with him is burned into my memory .	I could avoid them .	if
2	9973	Those were the old ways , and .	They no longer did things like that so obviously in front of the commoners .	but
2	54867	To tell one of the drill sergeants she was quitting .	Somehow they had managed to talk her down .	but
2	26099	She could barely see it in the moonlight .	She heard some mumbling voices .	but
0	130600	She might think she was the real girl .	Shed be wondering , what am i supposed to do .	and
0	71315	`` use your gift on me .	I 'll use mine on you .	and
3	102244	More importantly would she say yes .	He asked her to marry him .	if
0	53868	Silence burned her ears .	Not even the pounding hooves of the horses drowned out the annihilating blizzard she felt coming from him .	and
0	158621	It cut into my lungs .	Burned my fingers as they gripped the railing .	and
3	67732	I 'm not responsible .	Those two never have children .	if
2	111107	Honestly i could give a damn .	I dont want her having me come all the way back up here to do this .	but
0	138931	The car edged forward , crushing back the singing crowd , and moved ahead , throwing us against each other .	Then lurched for the center of the street .	and
3	103727	Not likely , but that was something he could discover whilst he searched for the king , if he still lived .	The country was in such a state and the lady knew nothing of it .	if
4	141459	It was almost dark .	I left the police station .	when
0	90093	I also call henderson 's secretary she arranges it for me .	Jesse usually arranges transport , but .	and
0	158172	Human bodies are frail . '' .	Some aliens are even more .	and
2	155392	Then he looked directly at me and .	I knew he remembered and his thoughts were like my own .	but
4	106323	He smiled , maddeningly smug .	Balthazar 's eyes met mine .	when
0	84557	Brad thought it should .	Looking back he thought it really stunk .	and
2	41195	Where he could keep an eye on me .	Still have his own conversations .	but
0	123597	But she still looked at him .	There was a silent question in her eyes .	and
2	43904	Many are learning it .	They could use more instruction .	but
2	40950	And the bloody arm is above him and cant summon the will .	Reginald wants to wince .	but
4	45818	I started to strip off the shift , and more importantly , who was looking back from it .	I noticed a mirror on the wall to my side .	when
3	81678	He would whip the sweetness out of her , and the thought disturbed him more now than .	He were to get her in his bed .	if
2	68330	Anyone else might have been difficult to spot in the darkness .	Alisa baronova 's platinum blond hair made it easy to pick her out amid the shadows .	but
4	23630	Of a small stain on the carpet .	They entered the room .	when
0	125192	The young man tossed the gun aside , eased him into a sitting position .	Running to his father .	and
2	110553	Panting , maisie peeked her head up and found nothing but vegetation close by .	Looked out the windows .	but
3	131267	Shed scribble a few words onto the paper .	It helped miss molly feel better .	if
0	146950	She tried in vain to ignore all the questions creeping into her mind .	Quickly got dressed to appease the four-year-old terror downstairs .	and
2	91460	Medicine is a remarkable thing .	I have to give monarch credit .	but
0	93967	Violating the tapu on our sacred burial sites .	Exposing us as a target for our enemies .	and
2	42987	She had never wanted to know about her heritage .	She read on it became impossible to put the book .	but
0	76019	I scanned the crowd .	Found jeff and fallon in a corner .	and
4	74931	He 'd just taken a sip of coffee .	His cell phone rang .	when
0	130193	Clouds were piling in .	There was more rain on the way .	and
0	86009	They would like to live , just to live forever and feast , the old man said , looking .	Consume those who are dead , or who are about to die , with their own hatred and fear , but never to die themselves .	and
3	141255	He 'd find a way to take advantage of it .	She gave him even the slightest bit of insight into who she was .	if
0	113586	They all hurried out of the cab .	Walked up to the door of the building .	and
0	120239	`` i want to touch you now , '' i say .	Close the distance between us .	and
4	118327	One thing bled through all the others : they needed to hurry .	The haunce outlined the plan for what they needed to do to stop the fragmenting of the realities .	when
1	160634	He tortured vallin for several hours but either the man was a true drunken idiot , or he was devoted to his cause .	He never spoke a word .	because
4	125168	I wont risk being .	This place gets filled with those monsters .	when
0	89152	Energy sizzled along my spine .	Put every protective instinct in my body on code red .	and
1	105495	Which was harder than usual .	I was so emotionally drained .	because
2	92220	They would continue to push us where they chose .	The bridges were not an option , at least not to me .	but
3	103326	The person might be a jerk or not fall for it .	The love potion didnt turn out .	if
3	121304	They 'd get poisoned in a more conventional manner .	Anyone his brothers followed made a wrong turn .	if
4	127671	Chapter 25 it was early afternoon .	I finally managed to drag myself out of jett 's steamy bed to text sylvie i .	when
0	144373	His voice was raspy .	Every word rubbed his throat raw .	and
0	158581	Fighting back tears she , loaded the library catalogue .	Looked instead for books on the subject .	and
2	123463	I blink several times .	Can only make out the general outline of their figure .	but
0	104398	A secret guilt proved too much .	He needed to go down the mountain and hand himself in .	and
3	62542	Dannos is still deep in the earth to avoid the worst-case scenario it has to be done .	Were doing to pull the plug .	if
0	66416	The short-term memories buzzed .	I felt past them to the stored memories .	and
0	114698	You 've divided a communal mind ! '' .	She 's looking for them .	and
1	81508	Was he merely talking romantic nonsensical things .	His heart was so heavily involved .	because
4	149074	Realized he had left his bb gun behind .	We got back to the tent in corys backyard steve .	when
3	3010	To come and see .	You two were knocking boots or .	if
4	96090	The sharp edge of panic cut .	He felt his eyes begin to water-so he purposely avoided the shrewd perception he saw in her face and dropped his gaze .	when
0	22961	With that , she slid her glasses on .	Walked out the door .	and
0	124781	Once then left the van , settling into the arranged spot and waited .	Headed down the path .	and
0	112628	Often his voice would turn to song .	He would get out of his chair and dance .	and
0	22707	Its glassy gaze over the hall .	Spoke with a shrill voice .	and
4	73307	`` and i will send an ancient one to destroy you for your disobedience . '' .	I do accomplish my purpose .	when
2	66759	Eric had turned out to be more fire-breathing dragon than anything .	That was a minor misstep on the rotting rope bridge of life .	but
3	88781	Then we need to train hard , and have faith as much as possible .	We 're going to defeat this darkness .	if
0	107878	Banks , especially the foreign owned ones are extremely worried .	May decide to relocate .	and
4	107106	His eyes are wide and luminous .	He looks at me .	when
4	124681	Baker continued did he call on your work or personal cell phone .	Detective bautista called you .	when
3	52222	It would be this .	Anything could kill me .	if
3	69415	You 'll be giving up much more than i will .	You stay with me .	if
2	43364	I was often tempted to shave it down to a crew-cut .	I 've got an image to maintain out .	but
2	39272	I tried to stand up .	A sharp pain shot up my leg and i fell .	but
3	49934	Here it is-my golden moment .	Ever i wanted to kick my own ass .	if
0	156674	Many of the cows were cooperative had other ideas .	Let themselves be led willingly to the harmless procedure but a few of them .	and
3	51631	And you will burn through lives and history .	Your fire is unchecked .	if
0	157857	He was telling the tale for the second time in a day .	He had to stop once during the telling , when he got to the actual death of his master .	and
4	52994	Being a military spouse sure sucked sometimes-even .	The marriage was a freaking farce .	when
3	65290	They might actually start thinking of him as the boss .	He kept this up .	if
0	120165	They rushed into my house .	Started pushing me around and hitting me .	and
0	2394	I was getting really cold .	Wanted to get home .	and
4	73746	One in six children born of such exposure showed remarkable improvements .	A fetus was exposed in utero .	when
4	158254	After a long struggle she 'd died when jala was ten .	She 'd been forced to relinquish jala 's upbringing to others .	when
3	118346	The bartender asked corbin .	He wanted a drink and he shook his head absently , puzzled , staring at the shot glass gregor had used .	if
2	50312	He resented the legal issues he needed to resolve before bringing his family to his home .	It was just one more of the obligations he faced as leader of duban .	but
4	69658	I clutch my hands to her hips .	Our movements begin to falter as passion takes over .	when
4	118920	His confident gait was so different from a year ago .	He was troubled and lonely .	when
3	145166	It must be a bad one , to have him sitting down there in the dark .	Peter had been struck by some illness .	if
3	51277	He 'd have noticed how hungrily vimes 's eyes watched it .	He 'd been that observant .	if
2	61659	Her face was beautiful .	It was a fake kind of beautiful .	but
2	15793	Two people had been in the pool .	Now a dragon , larger than a passenger van , had emerged .	but
4	66090	He waved her money aside and instructed the cabbie to wait for him .	They stopped in front of her building .	when
2	134556	'' she said , `` .	You 're on kp tonight .	but
4	139088	What he 'd done .	One hand covered an exposed breast while his mouth bent to the other .	when
0	57762	It feels as if the universe just delivered a fresh slap across my cheek .	My head is still ringing from the effect .	and
2	158960	I carefully step towards berwyn , whose body is lying .	I keep my eyes trained on the warlock .	but
2	119216	They didnt talk about megdline .	The bandits that cage killed got the king to offer thanks .	but
2	135273	I know ive never seen this place .	Oddly , it feels familiar.maybe ive seen a similar house before .	but
0	50402	Just he has fulfilled his promise as foretold by prophets to be born to earth .	Provide the great atonement .	and
0	99147	Out of the toilets i grabbed the fizzy blue drink out of natalies hand .	Washed the whole lot .	and
4	30555	I was walking around in circles .	I was hit with the feeling that someone was watching me .	when
2	95465	The orthopedic surgeons put me back .	I have these horrible scars to prove it .	but
4	153674	Long brunette hair swept across her shoulder .	She leaned her head down and made a show of wiping off the wooden chair situated for visitors .	when
4	157480	On the bristles and brain themselves .	The handle came flying up .	when
2	129452	It had all been patched up .	Still , olivia was having a hard enough time dealing with the fact that my own abilities far outweighed hers .	but
0	5093	He 'd been wrong .	He damn well should suffer for a bit before she forgave him .	and
4	103154	The moron had his head .	So he got close i brought my knee up and it met his face .	when
0	61023	But his wife and child had received a proper burial .	Were in the spirit world , and because he killed himself in order to follow the dead settlers , sun eagle was trapped forever in the land of the dead .	and
3	158625	Then he 'll practically beg to keep you around . '' .	You play your cards right and blow him .	if
0	85694	He realized what she was doing .	Made a fumbling effort to help her .	and
4	101281	Pretending nothing was wrong .	He couldfeel casey 's misery hanging over him like a black cloud dripping rain .	when
3	31555	They will send word quickly to intercept us .	We try to dock at ancora or sevadir .	if
2	143618	She would never be able to read people the way a natural could .	Over the years she had honed her skills , so she could she the truth , and emotions of the people who sat across her desk .	but
2	71459	He listened without interrupting , his expression unchanged .	I sensed his irritation from the stiffness in his shoulders and his overall stillness .	but
3	109194	You might want to acquire representation .	Any of this is true .	if
2	12807	The stories about it are a nightmare .	My vote hardly counts , as i am not going on the journey .	but
3	24073	You look at the back of the book .	You can not figure out how to get to the other end .	if
0	93501	Fin glanced at her .	Stopped his mutilation of the bathroom wall .	and
0	9707	Then the breh-hedden had gotten hold of casimir changed everything .	Casimir 's purpose had been to destroy both grace and leto , but .	and
3	28717	`` , they 'll kill you . '' .	You stay with me .	if
4	15910	She was exposed to some sort of toxic fertilizer or something .	Her and her friends went to go pick up the marijuana that we found at the crime scene .	when
2	42231	She was a math major , and then sold some crazy no-wrinkle cotton clothes .	Once they got married , she sold cosmetics from home .	but
0	89532	He was quickly given fatigues .	Shuffled off to change .	and
2	62357	She may not forgive me now or even in a week or more .	She will forgive me .	but
0	130827	In a flash , the memory came from somewhere deep .	It was as clear as if it happened only yesterday .	and
3	54092	You would eventually get some dino-dna .	You drilled into insects preserved in amber , and extracted the stomach contents .	if
3	85108	I 'm sure she would have told you , '' she snapped , and hurried out of the room after her mistress .	Mrs. branwell had wanted you to know .	if
3	147001	She cant be trusted on the battlefield , and probably not with liam , either .	She cant keep her head while killing .	if
2	49331	The order was less than severe .	There was nothing else i could do .	but
3	85975	I would walk to china .	Alexander were by my side .	if
0	38549	Oh wait , you did , then curran broke your spine and threw you into a fire .	First i kicked your ass .	and
2	76184	Just for a second , he 's taken aback by my reaction .	Then the element of surprise wears off and he smirks .	but
3	28232	Now he just had to figure out .	He had the courage to back away from the only woman he 'd ever truly loved .	if
4	150657	Only slightly bruised and bloody .	She left him in the driveway to walk away with trevor .	when
3	77579	It would be his head .	He let her pass .	if
0	118722	A hush fell over the crowd , the notes strong and true , blending with the whisper of the night wind and the faint crackle of the flames .	Even the rowdy young men near the tavern fell silent , until the only sound to be heard was her voice .	and
0	73011	He raised the sherry to her .	Bowed his head before drinking it all down .	and
4	48543	She wobbled and weaved like a drunken bobblehead .	Her feet hit the floor .	when
0	118727	She blinked open her eyes .	Saw that he was thrashing on his side of the bed , the covers kicked off and bunched at his feet .	and
2	37851	It would have been so easy for him to take control of the meetings .	He 'd allowed her the power .	but
2	93423	They were heavier and she managed to keep her balance and toss them .	Nearly knocked her on her ass .	but
2	55056	I feel my cheeks heat and i .	He shakes his head and smiles .	but
0	38256	He took his coffee .	Wandered into sophie 's room , idly looking it over .	and
1	34272	Had been let off .	He was a college professor .	because
3	2593	To explain the rules .	The answer was no .	if
4	71762	Wyatt used a mix of adrenaline and a drug called lycan-69 , some brew he 'd made .	He first started working with the werewolves .	when
2	2396	He needed a minute , he didnt think he could wait for her .	She just held on and kept moving her hips under him .	but
4	151738	They heard the sound it made smacking against the street .	He dropped it over the edge .	when
2	135852	Sure things were different .	The similarities were eerie .	but
2	4904	I was content to revel in it for the moment .	His directness made my eyes sweep .	but
1	66161	This personal matter and i use the word personal .	It is not really what you would call a problem she stopped as she just didnt know how to explain to him the circumstances without sounding like an idiot .	because
0	159092	The other ramon had climbed the tree to survey the land .	The branch supporting him had snapped .	and
3	105112	That 's not going to happen .	He wants me to give him permission .	if
4	39734	Zoe 's stomach was in complete knots .	It came to the notion of sam coping with these people on a daily basis .	when
4	47925	It would be because we both wanted it more than anything-with no help from outside stimulation .	I made love with chance .	when
0	42526	Nidiami had become convinced , early in life , that everything came down to power .	Power came down to force , bribery , and propaganda .	and
4	105773	She melted a little .	He grinned back , a devilish , sexy gleam in his eyes .	when
0	74538	's gaze locked with liam 's .	Liam felt a surge of triumph .	and
0	45858	He struck me as lonely .	There 's always something pathetic about loneliness .	and
2	105429	Shaved-head and gap-tooth had grabbed what coin they could from the table and the large , silent man seemed to have gone into some sort of fury .	Were in the process of melting into the jostling crowd of onlookers .	but
0	42172	It took tessie a moment to recover from tonis news , because she too was taken aback by the name mapita .	Felt a sharp pain in her chest at the mention of her name .	and
2	137477	It not command youi .	Gabriol hold fast , summoning raphaol , who arrived in human form on an arrow of light .	but
0	62257	She drugged my grandparents , and will probably try to destroy fablehaven next .	Took over the house .	and
0	130544	But molly lay snoring on her bed .	Rae had no intentions of waking her .	and
3	48199	I 'd also examine the area for the detritus that would be left behind from the explosives .	I had the opportunity to return in the daytime .	if
2	139898	Of course , he pretended to be busy with stable business .	He was waiting for that moment when she 'd come riding up the old clay road .	but
4	35020	They had hoped the cuffs would finally come off .	They were led into the chamber in the first place .	when
3	36016	That 's 2.4 million kronor .	You accept and stay the whole year .	if
2	132899	And it sounded so melodramatic .	I 'd never felt so sick in my life .	but
2	67733	He had not drawn his sword .	His men had and they were not to be ignored .	but
3	37447	`` nope , and , i 'm going to grow roots .	You take much longer .	if
4	19162	Ted could tell it had been made from scratch .	Sophia removed the potpie from the oven .	when
0	26969	The attack failed , they 're down a shapeshifter . '' .	They still want the child to be born , because they want the mountain pass .	and
2	62435	There was an intense burning as he broke my hymen with his fingers .	The pleasure he was giving me took away from the discomfort .	but
4	50123	How to wow a woman .	I 'm trying to win her back .	when
2	15554	The being could push its words into his mind .	Could not hear his thoughts .	but
3	97238	They 're going to see just how different i am from these other guys and take it all .	They ever get a really good look at me .	if
2	94178	Trenna had saved his friends lives by tossing the weapons out of easy reach .	The problem of how to break them free of this hypnotism remained .	but
2	144056	He not only runs the biggest prostitution ring in the state .	He also owns half the real estate in town .	but
0	117107	I screamed again , even though it opened from the inside .	Hurled myself at the door .	and
2	73832	In your haste to leave and get daniel to buy an acetylene tank using elliot 's name , you rushed out of the park and .	Drove off in your husband 's car .	but
3	115211	'' he added fairly , `` .	It makes him more willing to leave philadelphia and come south with us .	if
4	100598	How do you know our names .	Weve hardly revealed them .	when
0	105075	He faced old death himself .	Diced for his future .	and
1	52679	This part quietly , with a hint of sympathy .	The spell had been a real bitch for her .	because
2	80907	Needed to keep going .	Something in me had to know .	but
3	76149	You can get someplace .	You want to go there badly enough .	if
0	104415	He gave her an apologetic smile ; a puppet show wherein the kingdom of the beasts was ruled by a pride of haughty lions .	Told her of a puppet show that had recently become popular amongst the city 's smallfolk .	and
2	127369	His clothes were crumpled and grimy , and he seemed otherwise unharmed .	He had lost his glasses .	but
0	48327	The proper name for them was electro-cuffs .	The small , green lights on top of both of them were constant reminders of the pain they could cause me .	and
0	120198	It clanged loudly , echoing in the space .	Max whirled around just as the powerful vampire launched at him .	and
3	130738	I completely get why he signed everything over . '' .	It was anything like the one you sent me on .	if
3	7575	You still wont mind .	I face the other way do you .	if
2	93701	Yet talked to anybody that saw anything helpful .	There were some unusual happenings .	but
4	30496	Gladys set out to buy goodies .	They finally got in and found a place with speakers that worked .	when
2	132219	We have always agreed on everything .	I have a feeling that gage is going to be one of those topics best not discussed by us .	but
0	113685	I 'd say hello .	Ask how they were doing .	and
2	10780	Charlie momentarily debated telling her about toms lewd eyes and what they implied .	This didnt seem to be the time .	but
2	50337	He was by himself and i knew it was him .	His back was to me .	but
2	61083	I creeped him on facebook , but i had the idea to check out his brother mattys page .	I didnt find anything .	but
2	128493	James is guessing the cops are plenty inured to this behavior by now , true .	They surely have taken every measure possible to not hear this crap in the first place .	but
0	158784	I 'm sure if she were still here today she would have changed her mind .	Believed what i did now-my mark of destiny was more like a magnet for tragedy .	and
2	1815	We began to wind and twist around each other , not in the vulgar way so many others were doing around us .	We were carrying on a conversation without words .	but
2	123692	Blanding easily dodges the first few swings .	Gets caught in the face with a roundhouse kick that sends him staggering .	but
0	131521	Him arcing up into the air instead of down into entangling tents .	The harsh , metallic laugh of the vord queen mocked him .	and
3	160297	She might never speak to me .	Maisie woke up in a few hours and realized what we 'd done .	if
2	101074	At this point i 've regained enough control in my hand that i could probably bang something out on the piano if i tried , what it should be .	It would never be what it used to be .	but
0	158453	He shook his head .	His hair caught the light more than the small diamonds he wore .	and
0	66905	`` to my good soldiers , who have served the queen well , '' the captain said .	At once there was loud stomping and clapping .	and
0	48144	He jogged a few steps , tuck-and-rolled .	Rose to his feet right in front of a startled jaysynn .	and
4	26785	Her dad just shrugged .	He handed her the phone .	when
2	56368	Most of these men are my friends and lovers .	They are not so intimate with you .	but
4	120661	France 1924 most of the happiness in teresa de fosse 's life came from the church .	She was only eight years old .	when
2	6401	Ned was not near as confident of robert as he pretended .	There was no reason cersei need know that .	but
3	127351	She didnt know him at all .	That was the case .	if
0	47126	When it was pretty quiet in scrote .	There was nothing much to look forward to until the fun of the sprout festival .	and
0	121297	Annabelle grabbed hold of her arms .	Pulled her away from luther as she shoved her toward the hole in the pavement .	and
2	37333	We 'd overcome those emotions , and .	I 'd be damned if we 'd ever grow apart like this .	but
0	78044	But i commanded that vessel .	I was responsible for all the lives onboard .	and
3	138106	Then of course i would protect my child . '' .	She suddenly went crazy and wanted to get rid of him , which is what you seem to be implying .	if
0	31396	Which ransom 's garden had now become and then , almost silently , the casket had glided down between us .	Saw a black speck against the sunrise .	and
0	20492	They would pick a shop or a tavern .	Demand payment from the owner in exchange for the business not being hit by thieves .	and
0	15770	He snapped his fingers .	His guards brought forth two men .	and
0	128729	His hand closed in a fist .	He swayed , clenching his teeth to keep from begging for that touch .	and
2	39251	Noah could see why he might confide in her .	That made him feel betrayed by both of them , as if they were keeping this great secret from him .	but
1	43805	They must be protected from needless slaughter , if not because they are human beings .	Then we can not survive without them .	because
0	90388	He collapsed onto the sofa .	Buried his head in his hands .	and
2	19373	The yemis didnt have to jump over anything , the riders expertly guiding their mounts around them .	They did climb huge walls with obstacles on them .	but
4	93477	Worked directly under ; of course , that promise was a lot easier to keep back in college .	I interned as a page for a 75-year-old senator with false teeth , chronic halitosis ( possibly related to his previously stated lack of natural born teeth ) and eight kids , 14 great grandkids , and five great grands at home .	when
3	15044	I would have done it while you were passed out .	I could do it in human form .	if
3	38819	`` moyna , i would be pleased .	You would remain and tell me what you know of the elder enochia , and how you have served her in the past .	if
4	117750	She was definitely dead .	He saw her being carried off by the creatures .	when
4	74084	They take this show inside .	Her surprisingly firm hand wrapped his erection .	when
0	56035	I may be the youngest least of the children , but .	You can not command me .	and
0	111187	By the time he come back , i was married to mr. higgler , and .	He 's bringing back your mother .	and
2	12934	All lines lead to the bus depot .	As far as i can tell , nowhere else you 'd care to go .	but
4	147872	I was on my way to the docks .	I heard maisie scream and i came running .	when
0	128023	Stumbling forward , blood running from both nostrils .	Clintons ghostly face loomed out of the darkness .	and
2	142843	His voice was thin and whistling .	It was also unmistakably firm .	but
0	37213	He hesitates , his hand rising in front of him .	I can see his shadow moving .	and
0	76297	That had brought them to this system .	Had then brought them to their knees at the last by burning out the computer .	and
2	473	By now , the king 's guard will have noticed her .	The other wolves will have also noticed their fallen comrade .	but
2	117340	The marat heaved in breaths like a fish out of water .	Isana knew it would do him no good .	but
4	59750	The numeral two was dropped fiona donnelly , retired from the faculty .	The owner of the original fdonnelly handle .	when
2	60108	How it got to this point , i dont understand .	What the creator , mother nature , and i have concluded is that humans are too far gone to right it themselves .	but
0	15869	Sari , though , would permit no wavering in the advance .	The canim marched past the wounded , leaving them to bleed on the ground , hardly slowing .	and
0	14307	The undergrowth was scanty .	The tall , straight trunks of fir and pine rose like great columns toward the blue sky overhead .	and
0	58092	Growling deep in his throat , he sank his fangs into her neck .	Tasted the life that flowed inside her .	and
2	116529	You will find some modifications .	Most will be largely intact .	but
3	69085	No matter how close , then it is .	You can not get to it .	if
4	129326	Then laid her ears flat .	She figured out garrett was a stranger .	when
2	6622	Eddie looked to see what e-mail address paige sent the message from .	There was no return address .	but
2	112624	In fact , i may be able to help you in your quest ... ? '' .	First , may i make a suggestion .	but
2	131293	In addition , he could not help .	Fear he was in shock for the injury to his head .	but
0	34006	When i got there , the girl inside was just locking the doors .	Flipping over the closed sign .	and
2	71034	He put his hand up to stop her from walking past .	A knock at his trailer door brought it back to his side .	but
4	58988	It was nearly four .	He first noticed the man .	when
2	109389	I tried to think of all the successes i had had , instead of the failures .	It was no use .	but
0	48334	When you 're done . '' .	We 'll finish you off .	and
0	143322	It 's too dangerous ! '' .	I 'm not in a position to protect you .	and
4	156080	The stanford baseball cap calvin had picked up , back when calvin was still deciding between stanford and cornell .	He and his dad toured stanford last year .	when
1	153298	His attempt at humor fell flat .	Mostly jane was barely listening to him .	because
0	1726	I finished cleaning up the kitchen , heading toward the guesthouse .	Went out the door .	and
0	17165	He 's a good leader . '' .	He makes use of all his resources .	and
0	21049	Then left my hiding place .	Eased back over to the fireplace .	and
2	134867	I already know all this .	Hearing it still stings .	but
2	58819	It probably is i havent shown it to anyone or told anyone about what i found in the cave .	This may be a shawnee relic , and .	but
2	96471	The reality was , i had a respectable sense of rhythm .	My arms never seemed to coordinate with my legs .	but
0	124313	She had endured a lot of drinks , a few maulings and some open hostility .	Had essentially found out nothing .	and
0	65966	His face began to turn scarlet .	He fell to his knees .	and
3	93556	Then it will be true .	I think hard enough on that word .	if
2	24195	That not only had they accepted the news .	Seemed to be showing genuine interest .	but
2	114848	I looked to lee .	He was staring at the flowers .	but
1	69278	I kill , those who rape , murder , and breed darkness .	Someone has to destroy those born soulless and evil .	because
3	151310	Sebastian and kritanu would be there , somewhere in the darkness , having been delivered by barth and his hackney .	All had gone as expected .	if
0	156353	Still , he scowled at me .	Grabbed the assaulted area .	and
0	45776	Her gaze immediately slid to his arms .	Yep , for the third time in their acquaintance , she spotted that slight , barely noticeable azure glow .	and
2	115671	Looking around the deck it was tidy and all the rigging appeared to be in working order .	There were no sails .	but
0	13572	That was a glimmer of story , but the idea that space soldiers are out digging bases on nowhere planets .	That the alien enemy will go out of their way to attack or be attacked on these very same planets , is just stupid .	and
3	153243	They will remove more pieces of you , one at a time , which they will feed to pigs .	You still refuse to co-operate .	if
3	129890	You 'd be in some legal trouble .	You broke your contract .	if
1	44	The next morning they dont leave .	John is coming to inspect the house and tow the truck .	because
4	97844	He defeated humanitys enemies .	He created the dreamscape what enemies .	when
4	4314	She was more distressed at my distress this morning .	I found out she could barely move to get out of bed than at any pain she was feeling .	when
2	54566	He tried to keep from smiling .	The corner of his mouth inched .	but
0	80309	They comforted me with kind words .	Took me to my chamber to talk .	and
2	4626	Allana and leonie were not so bad .	They were still part of it .	but
0	28466	She tugged open the back door .	Climbed inside , silly right behind her .	and
0	109684	Almost immediately , he shut his eyes .	After some moments , the ball began to open .	and
3	41914	Why had i left alabama in the first place .	Only to come back three months .	if
0	84166	This city is crumbling around us .	You chooso now , today , to como looking for a briboi '' `` it 's not a bribo i 'm aftor .	and
3	153527	Seeing her as she is now , with her arms around the people she loves , is enough for me . '' .	Even we are never truly man and wife .	if
3	140780	They would have spent some time psychoanalyzing themselves and their actions .	Perhaps they 'd been more mature .	if
4	115956	Duke had lost his two front teeth three years .	A disgruntled former wrestler named bishop brock punched him in the mouth after a show .	when
0	124028	Small spark of compassion in him twisted it .	Clutched on to it .	and
0	55113	Instead of letting a live man walk with us .	Do his share of the work .	and
0	77613	I didnt know how well someone could sling magic while steering .	I didnt want to find out .	and
0	69111	Her father had returned home from the wedding .	In less than two years his newfound boldness had seen him gamble away the family lands and all the gold within them .	and
4	116695	He staggers through the door , clutching at his heart like he 's having a heart attack .	My dad comes home and sees izzy and me piled on the couch .	when
3	114593	It would be seen as a plot between him and me to rid himself of the brothers .	He sent ash and holly without guards to us and something happened to them .	if
0	141491	That held him to the pack .	Squirmed from of the straps .	and
2	67850	I decided never to move from it .	The sound of the phone changed my mind .	but
2	98662	The downpour had stopped , the thunder had retreated to the occasional ill-natured mutter .	It had continued to drizzle and these heaps of rock had a slick , unpleasant look , like slag from a mine .	but
2	20360	He may just be a puppet of the syndicate .	He still held more power than most of the people on the planet .	but
3	77768	Or they can remotely zap you into oblivion .	They 're too lazy .	if
3	67715	She 'll sense them .	The people around her have strong emotions .	if
2	50243	He did seem to enjoy his job .	She also knew that the main reason why he did not go back to school was because it would have been too difficult for a single parent who was raising a child .	but
4	32661	It would cause her or alexa .	He 'd jumped into the ocean .	when
4	32738	She grabbed hold , and then started giving back her solutions .	A laugh bubbled up .	when
2	26727	{ fandl took advantage of the ban to an uncanny degree , i must say ! '' .	It is not true that they had ten thousand copies of a new edition printed two nights before the announcement with `` banned by the antechamber .	but
0	3970	To reach across the table .	Firmly shake the right hand of each of them .	and
2	8593	An expert could eventually trace the call back to its source .	In this case , that was the point .	but
3	57179	Man , would i be in trouble .	I lied to my parents like that .	if
3	121748	`` but , then they 've missed out on a lot of contemporary fiction , which might be a shame , '' .	That 's all they read .	if
0	52626	`` but sooner or later , your mortal body will die ... unlike me .	You will be freed .	and
2	99961	He is a marvelous actor .	He feels very uncomfortable with people knowing the specics of how he took lord renoux 's place .	but
2	106815	I know i said no names , if you please . '' .	I feel the need to know yours .	but
4	78535	All six grunted their disapproval .	She cut to the front .	when
0	64197	Meanwhile , korad took a sponge began to rub her back between the shoulder blades .	Dipped it in soapy water .	and
0	4844	It immediately shot to full size .	The moment it did , devus gasped .	and
0	29391	Elizabeth pulled out of johnnys embrace .	Looked up into his eyes .	and
3	134498	We would appreciate it .	You would remove him from the school as soon as possible .	if
0	2015	He tells me about his grandmother 's doings .	He tells me about any tattoos and piercings he adds to his collection .	and
2	5244	I was a good dancer .	I had absolutely nothing on danika .	but
3	39406	It was that neither really worked out .	There was one thing that she 'd learned .	if
4	78974	And , he did it without a second glance .	Lothaire surrendered his priceless accounting book to dorada .	when
3	25831	I couldnt breathe thickening like cement in my throat .	The air around me was too dense and was suffocating me .	if
4	95828	They finally went up to bed .	No more sad sounds were heard for some time .	when
0	122219	-- the knife swung in a fat circle , catching him just at the hairline .	Sliced across isaac 's forehead .	and
1	52340	He needed to get helen .	That was the only shot he 'd have to get a taste of her blood .	because
2	154996	The drive to santa barbara was easy this time of day december had cooled off some of southern california 's weather .	The sun was still out , making it seem warmer than it really was .	but
0	38586	He dropped it on the arm of the couch . '' .	Suggested , `` perhaps we should all have a drink .	and
0	95548	Kyrin patted her leg .	She gradually returned to his side .	and
0	138586	Who was laughing until his gaze caught hers .	Joking with the blond one .	and
3	128792	But , why would lord ian offer to arrange for beth to meet with his brother .	The accusations in the letter were the ravings of a madman .	if
1	129213	Just shoot me , adam .	You are going to .	because
0	85042	You build a landing strip on the ranch .	Buy a lear jet .	and
3	69956	Our sex life was more in line with french vanilla .	I had to assign it a flavor .	if
2	158907	When i came home .	It was growing more and more .	but
0	70926	Just holding my phone in my hands .	Wondering what to do .	and
0	28993	That 's the bursar , and . '' .	This is the librarian .	and
0	160142	Perhaps , if he had been smarter , he would have kept the tiger prophecy and the writings of wintha the wanderer a secret to himself .	Waited to see the result .	and
2	110071	She began planting planted tiny kisses on his bruised fingers .	He stole her lips away with his own .	but
0	64618	At the edge of a small town , passing traffic became heavier where farmers sold their goods .	As pedestrians rushed under the protection of the slanted rooftops , a group of young men from the thieves guild waited inside a cozy restaurant among dry patrons .	and
3	156169	`` , i would . '' .	I knew how to stop doing this .	if
4	65340	He could make me do things i didnt want to do .	He had them replace my spinal nerves with a machine .	when
3	60953	There 'd be a lot of questions from his dad .	It turned out to be lost .	if
0	151348	As they put it , every young man wanted to be him .	Every young lady wanted to be with him .	and
3	56050	We could fit in any more .	Even i wanted to .	if
0	92471	He took a deep breath .	Then kissed her as softly as he could .	and
0	132748	She felt a few splashes on her face .	Looked up at the sky as it began to open and spill its liquid .	and
0	158333	The smoke from the fire rose , the barest amount of heat escaping as if through a sieve .	Curled against the top of the circle .	and
3	134748	I would be happy to make arrangements for another room , upgraded to a suite , at one of our other hotels . '' .	That would be suitable for you and your guest .	if
0	76530	Once i knew the location of the scene i gave kitto a chance to decide .	He 'd opted to crawl back into his covered dog bed .	and
2	129728	They drove back and forth on a few main boulevards , looking at pedestrians .	It was too dark to see .	but
0	26492	Tonight , sam would finally get some peace .	I would watch over him as he slept to make sure that no one tried to take it from him .	and
2	69196	Dont be paranoid , helen , she thought .	She couldnt help adding to herself , dont be stupid , either .	but
2	54190	Another pang twisted her heart .	Again she ignored it .	but
2	26549	There were only two of them .	It might as well have been two hundred .	but
0	17185	The world of humans had reclaimed him he could not stay .	He hated to leave , but .	and
0	157483	It was a simple confession .	Viktor 's eyes were wondering as he said it .	and
0	87227	He backs me up against the kitchen table , and places himself between my legs .	Effortlessly lifts me onto it as if i 'm made of air .	and
4	86395	Years later james had been given the option to live and join his pirate captors , or to be left in a rowing boat with the others , far out at sea .	The ship he was on had crossed the atlantic ocean and been captured by pirates en route to james town in the americas .	when
2	30845	Both girls were beautiful .	It was the one on the right that drew him back to the gallery again and .	but
1	51157	No warning had been given .	Perhaps the bandits were asleep in their tents to reserve their energy to attack at night .	because
3	87416	Still half an hour of light in 'em , i expect , ? ' .	You burn them in a saucer .	if
2	85489	Ethan caught it out of reflex and its interior became a cheery fire and now there was tiny white flickers of light circling around the flame .	Seemed marginally larger than it had been .	but
3	1639	You can begin to feel that ebb and flow of life , sense your part in it .	You seek out a quiet place and concentrate .	if
3	22839	It would be lost in the howl of the horrible wind .	Anyone were to yell a command .	if
0	143185	To counter this new threat , they hired pekings largest criminal gang , called a triad .	Offered to fund ten thousand quads .	and
2	23878	They were rather tasty ; besides , he would take the smallest reason to feel out of sorts this morning .	The tea was weak and not of the best quality .	but
4	129549	And , no reasoning tessa could come up with stopped her nipples from doing what they should n't . .	A couple of minutes later , he stared at her breasts , which her suit jacket moulded to prominent effect .	when
2	7380	Is not in moscow rather in cuba , where she 's been for six years .	The woman mentioned is their daughter and .	but
0	74281	I toss the plastic sacks over the dumpster wall .	Listen as they give a soft whoosh .	and
2	110330	Bollocks , '' he began .	She shook her head .	but
1	77108	Colby was having a hard time mustering sympathy , empathy , understanding and other such modern male attitudes .	He was the father .	because
2	22203	Well , nobodys untraceable .	Hes not making it easy .	but
2	36434	I knew abby had a different view and understood how it was consistent with her character .	I did not feel the urge to court chaos .	but
0	118337	He has lived in other places .	Is probably best known for his fantasy , dark fantasy , and horror stories and books .	and
4	64285	At least she did .	I talked to her the last time .	when
0	43330	The flames were three metres tall .	As the audience cheered enthusiastically and the men in the arena looked on in horror , the bodies of the two losers and the man whod tried to run , vanished .	and
2	154366	Mostly him yelling and we tried .	Me trying to apologize .	but
1	102989	She was planning to fake a marriage .	How would she do that .	because
2	47089	Chapter thirty-five homecoming the field is damp from the shower we had earlier .	Tonight there 's not a veil of fog , not a dark cloud up above , just the crisp arctic chill i 've become accustomed to .	but
4	43717	There was no noticeable change in the color of the scar .	He pulled his hand .	when
2	61243	Ve found qvite a few .	Zere vas ze story of a castle vich had been svallowed by ze ground in ze 1700s .	but
0	73887	Dan enjoyed his teacher .	Seemed to be getting good grades with ms. claridge .	and
0	69436	Then he put it back down , took one of his blankets .	Tore off a couple of large sections .	and
2	18085	Jay loved his family .	With jay 's habits and laidback manner , it was easy to forget that his family was actually well-to-do .	but
3	71113	Harry ill make you a billionaire .	You straighten up your act .	if
0	29726	Pricking at his skin it quickened his own need .	Revealing how much pleasure she was experiencing .	and
0	125148	Arissa went into an absolute fury . ' .	Ran off to that brothel down by the riverside - sorry about that , sephrenia .	and
2	149041	There was tea , of indifferent quality .	Alexia 's attention was drawn to the food on offer .	but
1	126988	Carrie had married the bastard .	She thought she loved him .	because
2	132989	That 's good and all . '' .	You 're forgetting something .	but
0	25270	Too i raised my weapon and dragged it up to its neck .	Stabbed the right half of my scissor-dagger to its stomach .	and
4	154304	To go for it .	The second verse of the lady gaga song that was the ringtone she used for beth started .	when
2	60400	Was a little irritating at times not harmful to us , or , but that was not the case for the people up top.those exposed to the gas started changing in the strangest of ways .	So we thought , sure the gas had no effect on us .	but
2	159813	She could tell there were a thousand questions ready to burst from within regarding lyric .	She would have to wait .	but
0	105303	She pulled her blaster out .	Flipped it to stun with her thumb .	and
0	125358	She breathed out a sigh of relief .	Turned around on the pathway , stone where rockbuds and shalebark had been scraped .	and
0	130918	He gently kissed her forehead .	Then he and his friends strode purposefully to the foot of the marble stairs and their waiting horses as the bells of the basilica rang out their own farewell .	and
2	30100	He demanded everyone show him their hands .	The only person with any paint on himself was gordy from his sloppy paint job .	but
0	103144	After opening the drapes , she sat on the sofa , remembering yet again what it had been like to be in roshan 's arms last night .	Watched the rain drizzle down the window .	and
2	54050	The empire was now surrounded by fences and rivers , and .	Almost all the revenants were outside .	but
2	1748	Garraty looked at him and he dropped his head and stared at the road .	Wanted to feel angry .	but
4	113166	She saw how truly talented her aunt was .	Bethany opened the book and flipped page after page through lauras pictures .	when
0	82135	In one fluid move , julian caught it .	Pressed a button on the cross hilt .	and
2	87313	When he caught up with the others , blaed had curtly informed him that both women were sleeping , and .	There had been an edge to the young warlord prince 's voice that had warned him not to push .	but
1	1843	Solomon only recognised the last words of the sentence .	It sounded like a name .	because
2	83094	She began to tell a story about great uncle tomas .	Stopped before he made any sense of it .	but
0	76526	Nomi waved them goodbye .	Went back to the locker room and a portal door opened for her .	and
2	21842	He 'd let her go .	It would kill him .	but
0	116404	She lifted her hands to either side of his face , pulling it to hers , the laughter still on her lips .	She stunned him further by kissing him .	and
0	92600	Last year , on a dare from link , i had written a paper called `` the war of southern aggression , '' .	Mr. lee had given me a d. guess the teachers actually did read the papers sometimes , after all .	and
3	82853	I would have my connection to her .	She had already turned .	if
3	144593	I would be bouncing off the bloody walls ! '' .	I were moving into that house .	if
0	39523	The driver shut the door .	A moment later , they were .	and
2	159866	I hated saying that i put up my guard for my one and only brother .	I switched into defense mode .	but
2	106470	The lower part of his face was covered by a mask , so that he would not be recognised .	It was obvious that he had been one of the cobra leaders .	but
2	21818	I can get to here , i point out the spot on the map .	It gets fuzzy from there .	but
3	155432	Well that would give time for the .	You could cooperate a day before peak fertility .	if
1	31945	She 'd transferred them from the ferrari when she 'd traded it in .	They always made her smile .	because
2	65506	His broad face kept the scowl .	He held his tongue .	but
2	435	Then i got a scholarship to go back to college , and .	It took a few years to find a job opening in pittsburgh .	but
2	160221	`` we made it through the endless commodes phase , '' rafe concluded , `` . '' .	There 's no way we can live here while they refinish the wood floors and paint the rooms .	but
0	77569	Giddeon had managed a birdie on every hole .	Somehow didnt surprise me after floating off the ground , shape-shifting , and making food appear on plates , i figured golf was pretty simple for him .	and
0	154644	Lady melly shot her a silencing glare .	Turned back to victoria .	and
4	20290	The usual feelings began to swamp him .	Posed with a threat - rage , wild energy , and blind-sightedness .	when
4	24440	To see dads expression .	You run it by him .	when
4	147428	Chris always thought of noel coward .	She saw him in a tux .	when
2	28159	There is no question . ' .	It was an unfortunate accident .	but
4	141728	She shook her head .	She noticed valentinas statue of st. anthony standing .	when
4	4337	She was almost to the door .	Jason 's voice stopped her .	when
0	144487	We reached the house .	Silas sat down on a rocking chair on the front porch .	and
3	134001	Far-fetched organization you claim to belong to , what would it cost me .	I were to consider joining this secret .	if
2	88946	He sounded like he meant it .	Who could tell for sure .	but
1	49128	I 'll go with her in the morning .	No one gets to yell at tiny but me .	because
0	28124	Fern jumped off the bed .	Backed away from lily , for the wind seemed to be coming from her .	and
0	85848	At the tree ... stephanie examined her face .	Tried to figure out her expression and what pandora was thinking .	and
0	15689	Seeing nothing he sighed , using his fastest long distance stroke .	Brazenly swam into the open water .	and
2	151302	I probably sounded heartless to my father .	Two things were predominant in my mind : derek and the cure .	but
3	25846	To be a free agent .	In the future you decide to leave .	if
3	57872	Perhaps he might try seeking out the mans help , or apply to the university near coe coa .	Eldo wanted to learn more about his healing powers .	if
2	44729	That something was wrong .	He was too slow on the uptake as something solid slammed into the back of his head .	but
1	124055	Something no one on earth had noticed .	He was such a wuss .	because
2	91655	Daniella might have had to persuade him to take me on in the beginning .	Now this case had become a matter of pride for him .	but
0	59030	He slammed the door .	Shoved its bolt into place .	and
2	111129	Abbot did release his hold , and the look roth sent me warned me not to .	I would 've raced .	but
0	67814	The light was deep red purple and .	Hiro felt the rays on his skin .	and
2	42852	I was a young person .	The sight of what terrorists did to our country and all those people , i found myself in a killing rage .	but
1	10015	The blacks adored him .	He was ozzie , one of their own .	because
0	57160	Even you deny this .	Forget you actually became yoked with this burden the moment you were caught with your countrymen while the sun still hung above us .	and
1	138849	A gasp slipped from her .	She knew his touch .	because
2	27655	He savored her mouth , his need urgent .	His tongue explored every recess of her mouth like he needed to be acquainted with every inch of it .	but
2	140591	A part of my brain totally got what he was saying .	My heart was another story .	but
0	45892	A little more is told in c of tuor 's departure from sirion ( in b there is no mention of idril .	There appears the motive of osse 's hostility to earendel and the curse of the nauglafring as instrumental in his shipwrecks .	and
0	78221	He had been crouching in front of her , but she wrapped her arms around his waist .	Stood slowly to go back down the stairs .	and
3	152943	-- ' you would not like to reconsider .	So you 'll just show me how to get .	if
2	53772	Obviously , she had succeeded .	Had she really won .	but
2	114944	I 'm sure you 're wondering what a fem is doing at a countenance roundtable .	I assure you , brothers and sisters , i come in alliance .	but
0	121754	She stood a few feet away , hoping she 'd judged him .	Watched him , waiting for the words that could exonerate or condemn her .	and
2	154057	A million questions ran through her mind .	The same one kept surfacing .	but
4	153747	They 'd left her like trash on the side of the road .	She 'd gotten old .	when
3	77041	You will find your life in jeopardy .	You dare to order me around .	if
4	74877	Come to think of it , maybe that was .	My obsession with punctuality had started .	when
2	102836	She might be beautiful on the outside . '' .	You 're more beautiful on the inside , where it counts .	but
2	154994	I glanced over my shoulder with almost every step .	He never got closer than his usual three steps .	but
2	33736	How to control it .	If you feed well , and often , it will be easy to control .	but
0	107334	I went over every square inch of the porch .	Checked the flower beds around it .	and
1	137625	Anyway , the reason i 'm calling is .	After we left the hospital last night we went back to ms. colley 's house and had another look .	because
2	69217	I mean i didnt do it .	We sent her the wrong meds .	but
4	148892	She was dreaming about being a musketeer .	Many little girls were dreaming about being a princess .	when
2	112928	Roanna registered the danger in his face , the venomous anger in his eyes .	She stood her ground .	but
2	29844	His ability was beyond question .	Jacks greatest concern was not atreus ability , but his intuition .	but
0	70644	Was as slender girlish as .	Hed still not finished his growth and still looked a beautiful boy with clear skin and no trace of dark fluff on cheeks or chin .	and
0	118905	Adam wrinkled his nose .	Held out a hand .	and
2	117071	Hope quirked an eyebrow at sean .	His somber expression told the tale .	but
2	124186	He wondered where she was going .	He was too tired to give it more than a passing thought .	but
3	53018	How pissed nate would be , and it makes me somber .	He saw me standing here , in my bikini , being ogled by these men .	if
3	74289	How she feels about her relationship .	She isnt able to tell stuart .	if
0	157066	Wiggling out of his arms .	Instead taking his hands in hers .	and
2	102910	The larger part of me wanted to stay right there , and that made me think of my aunt anna , and i didnt want to live out her fate .	Secure my bond with evan before anyone could do anything about it .	but
2	81445	Which was probably once white .	Was now a filthy grey .	but
3	43442	`` , i might have to whisk you out of here before we even get to taste the appetizers . '' .	You get me worked up .	if
3	6324	You did not say . '' .	You liked my playing .	if
0	159251	A very senior royal and his two sons rose to their feet , much to the puzzlement of the rest of the tables occupants and came to a halt in front of david , and came to attention .	Came around to the front of the table .	and
4	92768	How they could just sit on that power .	They could be an agent for good .	when
2	154320	Again , his pale eyes twitched up to me .	This time they darted .	but
0	160520	Aislynn smiled fondly down at her wolf .	Then turned her smile toward the king .	and
2	52328	Hed been scouted by a few college teams .	Nothing ever came of it .	but
3	59512	I will be in for some shocks in the future .	His behaviour is anything to go by .	if
0	67284	His father had brought him aboard yesterday afternoon .	They had been delighted to take him , the mate pleased with his ability as an archer .	and
2	157346	That would have felt nice , he thought .	There was no way to get .	but
4	148021	His eyes filled with dread .	Chartrand saw the open grate in the floor .	when
4	26966	The line of worry had appeared between his eyes .	He glanced at me .	when
0	84754	His breath washed over my neck and my face .	I only had a moment to register the smell of cigarette smoke before my mind inexplicably flashed to jack .	and
2	99331	We can stay in touch .	Right now i need to help them .	but
2	128247	Until very recently he 'd feared the family shutting him out the way they had faith .	He 'd grown in the short time since meeting zoe .	but
0	133228	Now driving a rented suv until barge service started .	He could get his cop car back and .	and
1	24252	Mary kate must have jumped at the chance .	She came in from home in order to see me after sessions .	because
4	109791	... '' he trailed off with a laugh .	Jimmy went down the hill .	when
2	88823	He 's still figuring his life out .	He 's a great kid .	but
0	121074	Despite all his reassurances to temeraire , laurence himself was up and alert by first light .	He could not wholly repress a degree of anxiety in his own breast .	and
4	90898	To maintain an aloof stance .	He wanted to embrace his son .	when
0	77873	Balthazar 's dark eyes narrowed slightly at the mention of lucas 's name .	I knew he could sense my reaction to the memory of the hours lucas and i had spent in that room .	and
0	24408	She unclipped her hair .	Worked shaky fingers though the damp tangled strands .	and
2	77340	True , she distrusted him as he distrusted her .	There was no reason for any show of force .	but
1	55683	You have to stay on guard . '' .	He 's drawing you into his game .	because
2	159364	Renzo started to report it .	Hesitated as he waited to see what would happen next .	but
2	58524	`` what grover and the griftons did or tried to do to you was wrong .	To steal you away at your engagement ball , to humiliate a duke like that and to marry you in haste the way i did was to ask for trouble .	but
2	159015	He followed me and i was in no mood .	Tried to put an arm around me .	but
4	97191	She dragged her hot liquid up to moisten her clit .	She pulled them out .	when
3	19693	`` but any skeptic would have a poor knowledge of trensicourt . '' .	He hoped to stand against the tide of humanity that will rise up to welcome their king home .	if
4	6627	She had been in the middle of breakfast .	She realized that returning to london meant she would be leaving noah .	when
3	18684	I 'll keep her alive with a face so scarred she 'll never want to look in a mirror .	You do not answer my question .	if
2	120115	Their lives hung in a balance between life and death , as did his .	Now the difference he felt was worlds apart between then and .	but
2	146151	`` back home , '' i say , knowing it 's stupid to go .	It 's all i know .	but
3	127381	He would have thought i was nuts .	The taxi driver had looked in the rearview mirror .	if
4	106346	My husband beckoned to me .	The pair of miniature dragons showed up .	when
2	150669	He was only a kid .	Remembered watching scared out of his skin when dr. jekyll changed into something that resembled a werewolf ... rather interesting coincidence , dont you think .	but
4	38489	*** candi went instantly sober .	She saw xena take off after her totally stupid boyfriend .	when
3	56600	You have cancer and still want a kid .	You 've just found .	if
4	42571	She was not surprised . '' .	The tension eased from the same parts of his body and he said , `` i am willing .	when
3	134414	Brax will never forgive me .	She does n't . .	if
0	37723	I 'd beaten vivian .	Now , i 'd killed loki .	and
3	106891	I would inquire of the silent brothers .	There was another manner in which mrs. lightwood had died .	if
2	101699	I would like to see how deep it really is .	I think that will have to wait for another day .	but
1	117429	She can no longer perform her duties .	She 's been corrupted by the touch of a mortal .	because
4	156200	She obediently accepted it , allowing him to help her up into the landau , where she took the seat across from him .	So he offered her his hand .	when
1	105042	People chattered , of course .	Angel bay is so small and that 's what small town people do .	because
0	2722	His foot hit the step with no sound .	The netherlings took not a breath , dared to utter the word .	and
2	29727	She started , hand going to her dagger .	Relaxed as she recognized amys .	but
2	152766	There was blessings in that , he supposed .	Nothing felt that way .	but
2	110393	She woke up with night already showing through the windows .	She felt much better .	but
2	142920	I edged closer to one of them .	By the look of it , you had to order drinks to keep the table .	but
0	63504	He approached again pressed her close .	Put his hands roughly around her .	and
1	8896	It 's not illegal .	It 's an international broker .	because
3	25246	Even so i didnt know .	I could stand the constant ups and downs of this shame and reconciliation within myself .	if
2	101407	Do it here at the station .	Someone from the mayors office will probably show up because the fbi will be .	but
0	141112	Its wingtip had passed over his head .	Then both aircraft continued on their way to mauritania , nobody in morocco any the wiser as to their where-a-bouts .	and
0	95132	She dropped her head .	Returned to her relentless assault on him .	and
2	62057	There was a niggling fear at the back of her mind as she realized her vulnerable position .	That only turned her on more .	but
0	68583	Helen stared at the cloak .	Repeated lizzy 's words in her head .	and
0	71949	Once inside , sigebert would unsheath his sword .	Kill everyone in the place .	and
0	119487	His expression darkened as he listened .	By the time i finished my account , his gray eyes were lightning fierce with outrage .	and
0	91276	Within minutes , i found a furnished apartment for five hundred bucks a month .	It made sense to get my own place , as it was hard to say when i would be up to the task of finishing what i 'd started .	and
3	7259	The fire in his throat was strangely soothing .	Only to distract him from the pain in his head and the soreness in his back .	if
0	59898	I looked over in horror at the group of orcs that were mobilizing in the direction of the fire .	I saw that all of our weapons were leaning against a tree where the orc had thrown tony 's axe .	and
2	104806	She could walk away from a business .	She could never stand to have it taken from her .	but
0	90897	Charlie gave her a nod .	Falon winked at her , seeming happy to have them .	and
2	137886	It was just a small group of about 10 fish .	They were the right size that the mermaids were looking for .	but
0	157013	She started to break now then they would never survive this .	The most important thing right now was to make sure that the creatures in this town were destroyed before they could wreak havoc upon the earth .	and
1	149844	The tactile feeling of the pads of his fingers , the brush of knuckles , or the heat of his palm took the tightness from her muscles and melted her body .	Maybe she 'd spent her life without skin-to-skin contact .	because
4	62205	It is not a good story .	It inspires a woman to look for a rich benefactor .	when
1	75329	When someone like nicholas looked sad .	There was no way it could be good .	because
0	60976	Id lost any conviction in my voice .	This time zeal knew i was making excuses .	and
0	8495	Lately , her mind had been on the aes sedai their problems , and .	Weaves had come naturally to her .	and
0	89007	It has a long inlet from the sea .	Already had the facilities in place to support the building of a dozen ships at a time .	and
3	104478	`` but , let me know . '' .	You decide it 's not to your liking or if there 's anything you want me to change .	if
0	121799	Brielle came over to do my makeup .	I fill her in on all the logan drama as she applies my false lashes .	and
0	80640	A place annalise had ever been .	She had made sure her wings were hidden when she arrived .	and
2	90407	The other half had managed a defensive square .	It was a ragged one - the mantises were steadily picking it .	but
1	38162	He was also upset .	Earlier that evening , he had had a row with miss clark .	because
2	98685	Who was loath to anger miss peregrine .	Insisted that we needed her protection .	but
3	137846	How he would feel - at stake .	It were his own life and the lives of annie and his children .	if
0	9116	Matt hit the misguided entrepreneur across the back of the head .	Then heaved the dead weight over his shoulders .	and
0	127668	He shook it off .	Reached forward to open the glove compartment .	and
0	109239	They all understood the special bond between him and his national security advisor .	They all resented it .	and
4	19258	I was just getting ready to call you , jace said .	He answered the phone .	when
1	111184	I was coughing and throwing up .	She 'd held me under .	because
2	90662	Everything is new , overwhelming , and confusing .	You will soon feel as if this were what you were born to do .	but
0	67539	Andriano 's occupied a nice little spot on euclid avenue in little five points .	Catered to an almost middle-class crowd .	and
4	97007	You have the best damn police department in town .	You have officers you can trust .	when
2	4804	Margaret had no idea whether it was fair .	She knew she would pay it .	but
2	63661	Her mom is talking to her .	Shes not real and shes not going to come .	but
2	38675	I opened my mouth to explain .	Her eyes moved south and then widened .	but
2	119385	I know you and the other dads have talked about it . '' .	To be honest , i always thought it was a bunch of mushy horseshit .	but
4	109701	And , leaned down , and whispered in his ear , he liked that even less .	The king beckoned his cousin marghaz closer .	when
0	48104	Rae stared at her roommate .	Played with a wet , dark lock .	and
0	138125	When the year 2000 came .	The technology boom reached its heady heights .	and
3	136160	Not he would n't . .	He were a good confidence trickster .	if
3	41664	They were still miles and miles of nigged territory away from help , but he preferred to cover all possibilities .	Even someone scaled the rock faces of the mountains to the northeast .	if
2	11791	No , you dont , i stamped my foot into the pavement and attempted a halting maneuver .	She just simply walked on , dragging me with her .	but
0	33842	He leans back against the pillows .	Runs a hand through his hair .	and
2	137038	It wasnt that she didnt want to be a comfort .	She couldnt help feeling thats all shed become .	but
0	109786	To break down the three tribes .	Unite them all as one on edla .	and
0	103438	Lucan was dressed in a cream colored suit with a white dress shirt underneath .	Was the perfect older version of kiran .	and
0	89706	I 've made new friends , and for that i am most grateful . '' .	New family - family i never had .	and
1	106983	`` god , it feels so good to have you touching me , '' he says in a hot , hungry voice .	He 's held out for .	because
0	146729	He had been a farmer 's son before he found his calling .	His hulking physique remained intact , along with a startling openness and honesty in his light brown eyes .	and
2	41382	We always smelled of rose water .	He was definitely no infinity , as the rose water was too weak .	but
4	109933	And , it made it worse for him .	He saw my sadness .	when
2	46752	Lady antillus was nowhere to be seen .	Magnus was sitting on a camp stool beside the cot , a simple wooden framework with a sheet of canvas serving as the bed .	but
0	71234	The kids were with mary lou .	Russell and i had the house to ourselves .	and
2	98992	I thought that teacher had any answers for me .	It was pretty clear she did n't . .	but
3	75662	Hell he would have negotiated to have it delivered to them .	Theyd come to him and asked for the medicine .	if
0	118635	It was past midnight .	All the events of the day and evening had taken a toll .	and
2	38284	They have amassed considerable power .	It is the struggle they maintain between each other that prevents any one from becoming too powerful .	but
2	121110	It was pretty good for what it was , bit sketchy .	Then again it really didnt have to be too detailed now did it .	but
2	42084	The planes of his face were strong and bold .	Softened slightly by his overly long hair .	but
2	80514	He had never heard such a song .	Was mesmerized by it .	but
1	87943	When i think about jack .	It never really saves me . '' .	because
3	128176	I withhold three thousand .	We settle in three months .	if
0	139082	In spite of that , i smiled .	Tried to keep my thoughts light .	and
0	95223	Thank you , '' she murmured .	Picked up a chip to pop in her mouth .	and
2	9781	She hated it when i fidgeted .	Now that i was married , she felt it impolite to mother me .	but
2	98884	His grin was tired and pained .	At least he was still alive .	but
2	108238	The price of everything blew my mind .	Sally was good about splitting it .	but
3	59578	I want some warning . '' .	The monsters come out to play .	if
2	98755	He continued , `` , and by the time i jumped away , i saw them .	Then i felt one on my hand .	but
3	65128	`` but , '' dissident snapped .	You dont find him .	if
2	32251	The pain caused a head-splitting headache .	It helped numb the pain in the rest of his body .	but
4	119892	What the hell would he say to kelly .	He saw her for the first time since his return .	when
0	54780	Edgar mane from westland , i lost a good friend at tursy .	I intend to take as many lothian lives as i can .	and
2	106926	The notebook is a great piece of evidence .	The dreamstone provides the real proof behind the story .	but
2	99864	I had driven at a higher speed on the highway .	Traveling on the water felt much faster than going a similar speed on land .	but
3	109882	He did it because he thinks i helped noll escape his men .	It is as you say , and the vogts men burned my home .	if
2	126997	Rachel was sure he 'd attend one or two sessions .	Then he 'd find some excuse to cancel .	but
0	8216	We were lost at sea .	Our boat just followed the waves .	and
3	35957	Then he could live with that .	That made him a selfish bastard .	if
0	84219	My cheeks were bright red ; i looked at jericho , hoping he would give me answers quickly before amory said something .	My forehead started sweating .	and
0	149296	I was just waking up .	Had to have misheard .	and
2	53963	Burnett 's tone had lost its force , and .	Kylie wondered if he believed it .	but
3	139346	We will redirect our course to cut them off .	You decide to pursue it .	if
2	95805	This is the guest room , she said , adopting a real estate brokers cadence .	I doubt anyones ever stayed .	but
4	157008	We have caught , then i 'll begin to worry about something else . ' .	I 've had a look at the fellow .	when
2	147410	Seem to get within five feet of each other and not touch .	What happened when the chemistry wore off .	but
2	133956	Having weather change a timeline on a job was nothing unusual for him .	Usually there were tens of thousands of dollars in penalties at stake .	but
1	48115	Never mind what had happened after .	She 'd gotten through landline-to-landline .	because
2	79836	It was a gamble taking him back to ki .	Jackson had no choice .	but
2	105016	Talk to you soon , janie it seemed benign .	I was pretty sure it would annoy the hell out of her .	but
2	114333	She started off down the hall .	My hands on her waist stopped her .	but
3	79715	To accommodate requests from your guests .	Especially they 've paid for a lifetime membership .	if
0	138557	She recovered with haste glared into his face .	Her eyes widened momentarily , but .	and
4	31514	To get a job .	You have that arrest on your record .	when
3	8454	`` , i 'd lose everything .	She ever found out i was dating someone .	if
0	100403	He took an olive-drab duffel bag from his shoulder .	Set it on the ground .	and
2	44262	The elevators bronze fittings winked seductively as he circled .	The love apple had chosen his means of ascent .	but
4	149835	I caught her off guard .	I whipped into a small dirt road and slammed on my brakes .	when
2	32183	Richard looked away , he knew her overall assessment of him was true .	He had a hard time accepting praise .	but
2	92457	He opened his mouth , as if he meant to say something to jace .	His knees were already buckling .	but
1	66844	Survival of the fittest .	At the end of the day he was what he was-an animal .	because
2	8302	This was not necessarily the way she wanted roland ( or any other man , for that matter ) to make her feel .	She seemed stuck with it .	but
3	99456	I would love you forever for the embarrassment you caused him . '' .	You had no other virtues .	if
0	124243	He watched the dark figure walk down the steps .	Leaned against a pillar .	and
2	141545	I 've been trying to avoid the girl since she puked at her party .	Since she 's on my list of people who might have framed me , i 've got to get closer to her .	but
0	153197	But he 'll be the king of the algars one day . ' .	Seething hatred of his is likely to cause us some problems .	and
0	24380	The police chasing us .	Making a bad situation worse .	and
2	70494	`` an impassioned statement in favor of the alterant to be sure ? '' .	If we allow this alterant to remain free , will you pay the price of this tribunal 's judgment if you are wrong .	but
0	132095	Raising ashes from the fire trench .	Fanning its flames a little brighter .	and
4	60343	He put his hands on his waist and took deep gulps of air , as if he 'd just completed a marathon .	Rutger finally waddled over and dropped his pathetic two sticks onto the pile .	when
4	96994	I remembered , i felt like i was hurtling through outer space .	He took my hands in his .	when
0	142200	Perhaps instead of isolating ourselves of an evening , i should visit the local tavern .	See if i can not learn something of these mystics you speak of .	and
4	1568	He slowly turns me around and pulls me into his chest .	I 've stopped struggling in his arms .	when
4	65721	In fact , that was the first thought out of johns mouth .	He realized that dierdre had come to stay for a while .	when
2	143645	Adam wrestled free from two of the vamps it would definitely take him out of commission for a bit .	Broke the neck of a third-not something that would kill the guy .	but
4	140519	The cell phone rang , and i reached over to answer it .	He 'd gone back to his newspaper story .	when
0	149140	To get it out of his system .	Settle down to marriage with patrice .	and
2	30066	All that year i waited for the truth to come out , to be arrested and perhaps imprisoned .	Nothing happened and slowly i pushed the memories .	but
4	97871	Knowing you knew nothing was the best place to start .	Facing a spirit like mary hightower .	when
0	41503	Jason arose tarnished crown .	Moved by the simple ceremony despite the blind king 's ruined castle , raspy voice .	and
2	50828	The bullets pinged off the rocks around me .	None of them actually came close to hitting me .	but
4	69536	During the first six months of his practice as a psychiatrist judd had developed blinding headaches .	He was undergoing the required two years of analysis necessary to become a psychoanalyst .	when
2	26328	`` then i was picked out for the brandenburg division and and go back to germany and start training for the big water-jump to england .	I had to leave the girls and the champagne .	but
2	4819	I wanted to actively parent the kids .	I was deathly afraid it would make things worse for all of us .	but
3	15285	We can get to work .	You would retrieve them .	if
2	82301	Her put on her coat and they were the only ones .	Took her to the pods .	but
0	20972	Six months later , so had megeara 's brother when his diving line had tangled .	His tank had run out of oxygen .	and
0	93158	She put a hand up to her mouth .	Coughed , trying to ward off another sneeze .	and
1	9144	`` you ditched your date ? '' .	You were worried about me .	because
2	144177	Anything to be coy .	To satisfy her own curiosity and to make sure that she was in full awareness of all the facts .	but
2	34412	Dire wolves are more intelligent than normal wolves .	These seemed even more intelligent than the average dire wolf .	but
2	90981	Claire tensed , waiting for the pep talk .	Her sister said nothing .	but
0	146422	So i raised my head , although my legs trembled , and my knees threatened to buckle with every step i took .	Tried to look as strong and confident as possible .	and
2	139774	Know i 'm not perfect .	I make good money .	but
4	61823	What your sister did .	She met my uncle mac .	when
2	107480	Her heart stopped beating .	She came back with a little help .	but
2	121041	We fight as individuals .	Maybe we can use that to our advantage .	but
0	123467	They had left all their stuff in the detached garage .	It was pretty empty down .	and
3	2866	I mean then what are orcs planning to do with it .	It is what you say it is .	if
0	64149	Then , lea landed a left uppercut to the opponent 's chin a left hook to the opponent 's head .	Followed by a right uppercut .	and
0	138602	He would assist her with health issues .	With her arm around his waist they climbed the carpeted stairs to elizabeths old room .	and
0	90540	She took mouse from johns hands .	Held it defensively against her chest .	and
2	142983	Then picking up the pile of clothes , he headed towards the bedroom .	Stopped mid-stride when he realised what he had just uncovered beneath them .	but
3	123931	I 'm happy to volunteer william . '' .	You 're headed into something dangerous .	if
0	9018	Pulling a single red rose out of his jacket .	Handing it to her .	and
2	35279	She wouldnt ask tom if he could fix it .	Maybe she could call him to get a recommendation for someone .	but
2	14225	I knew that promises werent meant to be broken .	Some , in fact , were .	but
4	7887	Tandy to rey and captain blankmann .	They were discussing it that morning .	when
2	155502	He 'd more than understood her malice , and .	He 'd never held it against her .	but
2	105070	Mia might deny it .	The guy wanted her regardless of whether or not he was engaged to someone .	but
4	107195	Paul realized it was actually hodge that was getting the glare .	He tried to meet james eyes .	when
0	63419	To get inside indulge in their fantasies .	Get drunk or high .	and
2	13175	It had the jaws of a water imp , or of a bear trap .	Wouldnt have been doing them justice .	but
0	149685	He was on the crest of a wave .	Then stand up so that it would see him outlined against the sky .	and
0	90982	The agent just rang .	Said this property had come available through a mortgagee sale and was i interested .	and
4	70314	Perhaps that is , when it says there is danger , i heed the call regardless of the repercussions for i refuse to allow myself to feel helpless .	Why the music calls to me .	when
2	84068	There 's a branch of the government that knows of us , within the department of defense .	That 's about it .	but
2	58734	She wanted to put her arms around him and keep him safe from the demands of so many others .	She had been the one to put him in the position .	but
2	41322	We were tucked out of sight beneath the front of the boat .	It wouldnt take them long to figure out where wed gone .	but
4	68034	We knew it was him , we were praying for , said one of the ladies .	Jesus christ was born .	when
2	116765	It 's way passed her curfew and .	They 're gon na freak .	but
2	5705	Sure , she probably doubted what i said would be so easyshe was .	What was she going to do .	but
0	159481	Marley stopped in the foyer .	Clamped her lips shut .	and
2	148918	Rann ignores my mind-propped words .	Steals a single eye gleam at me .	but
2	103730	Saltwater sluiced over the nose cone and small waves crashed against the sub 's side .	The vessel did not move .	but
2	107346	My body was dead tired .	My brain was alert , energized by anger at everything doug had said .	but
2	109835	Slowly i took off the hood , expecting to hear the brief retort of exploding gunpowder at any second .	There was no other sound than the echo of my own heavy breathing .	but
3	37181	I would 've noticed .	She were a he .	if
2	2054	As calmly as she could , she opened her telepathic frequency to ethan .	Ry entered her mind .	but
2	86929	It was a happy dream and the knocking persisted and grew more desperate .	She longed to return to it .	but
0	17124	He dropped the wallet .	Pulled a knife with a wood-and-brass handle .	and
4	48669	This is going to look like a new house . '' .	I 'm finished with it .	when
0	139942	After tessie rushed back into the house , toni was on the phone .	Seemed to be carrying on with some business at her work .	and
0	118172	It was somewhat larger than a crow .	Was not ( she decided ) exactly a bird should be .	and
2	67117	I couldnt see the contents of the storage area well from the chair .	There were a number of devices and bottles filling the space .	but
2	138119	He had not studied english very hard at school .	He kept it up as a hobby .	but
2	25643	`` it 's pathetic ... '' she stopped talking when she noticed robert .	He was smiling at her last comment , which somehow made him feel vindicated for ploof 's getting credit for the s24 research .	but
0	94305	The ominous sense of foreboding seemed to have reached them all .	They rode warily with their hands near their weapons and their eyes searching for trouble .	and
4	72165	My face split into a grin so huge i thought my face would break .	One of them latched onto the tip of my pinkie finger and started sucking .	when
0	46828	Hersheys factories were flattened .	His family inheritance wiped out .	and
0	12177	That claimed i had chopped the giant into little pieces , was using her remains as bait for fishing in the aneirin river .	Had stuffed her into a cooler .	and
0	41915	Just put gel in your hair .	You will be fine .	and
0	107713	Jahja noticed the commotion .	Yelled at them to form a line .	and
0	29667	Never forget they 're carpathian . '' .	Need the rejuvenating soil just as you do .	and
0	14706	We enjoyed a great evening of barbeque with friends .	When i said wed be heading south in their fine state , they gave me the warning .	and
0	69978	The cold solidity of glass passed through me .	I was inside the castle .	and
0	99327	I 've been here less than a week . '' .	I 'd love to learn more about him .	and
0	133898	He cleared his throat , began : `` to you i may seem a vulgar robber , but i bear on my shoulders the destiny of the human race .	Almost he struck a gesture .	and
2	141934	I 'd tried to look .	Lucky had pinched me and given me a look .	but
2	51087	His grip appeared to loosen .	He didnt let go .	but
3	14862	That i 'd follow .	I ever took the next step , curious to see how she handles twenty when the curse falls upon her .	if
2	45075	How could paul and ? '' .	Lucy know that we 'd be there today and not some other time .	but
2	15903	I could not make out the words .	I was certain of the gist of his reply .	but
3	151669	`` , '' claire sniffled .	Only miss peregrine could tell us .	if
3	101786	Freak hed be fine .	He were calm and didnt .	if
2	156458	She had no idea how she got .	At least there was a way of escape .	but
2	159595	She may have been leading him and fifteen others to a temporary iggaraout .	He was taking a few more steps to confront the men who killed his father .	but
3	142517	The victims are still untortured though all the deeds have been done .	The tortures have not been set down on paper .	if
0	106038	When she felt something loop around her neck .	Give a vicious yank .	and
4	114749	That oozed fluorescent yellow .	The yolk was pierced .	when
4	153264	He will give you each a bonus .	Chyelivny comes to his senses .	when
0	143424	Daniel had performed his task .	They had been able to make their exit without being heard or seen .	and
0	91317	Peter was off his bike .	Pulling on the fence .	and
0	109825	How their rafts had been cut loose in the swift water .	Many men drowned when the rafts broke up .	and
2	28062	It 's vaguely like prostitution .	It 's such naughty fun .	but
2	41958	Automatically , seldon looked upward to see if that were indeed the case .	The `` sky '' above was blankly luminous .	but
2	74883	The choking knot of frustration in zook 's chest fell apart in the silence .	His kernel of irritability still stood ready to pop .	but
2	71911	Jack tried to sit .	The bolts rattled in his brain .	but
2	77246	Miss keppel looked across to the other .	The old eyes were fixed fast on the flames .	but
4	150938	She half expected jo and laura to be .	Amy walked into the restaurant .	when
4	38125	Dakota started asking questions .	They were whisked through security with only a metal detector and a baggage x-ray .	when
2	152535	Her reassuring smile was a pathetic attempt .	She had to do something to give the woman hope .	but
2	99723	Come to aid them .	Traitors come to destroy them .	but
2	85904	I am not one to panic .	Other growls became audible in the darkness , interspersed with occasional perplexingly deep and voluminous barks , i must admit to coming close to doing .	but
0	16973	Snarling , billy ray dropped to his knees , flipping it into bubbles 's face in a single , swift motion .	Grabbed a handful of dirt .	and
0	131731	At least , i think he is .	He has reddish gold hair that halos his head .	and
0	118481	A little while later , the group emerged from command central .	She shimmied to her feet , trying not to look anything other than relieved at john 's scan .	and
4	15212	Drew a sharp breath .	He saw who it was .	when
3	106042	It is not me to judge .	They deserved to live or die but , in the situations we were in , it was them or me .	if
2	51513	Duke paused long enough to fire a few rounds from his revolver after the retreating prius .	Did not manage to hit anything .	but
2	14686	When he finally pulled out of me , i instantly missed his warmth .	Also felt a sense of relief .	but
3	42745	They can be almost nice . '' .	You catch them in the right moods .	if
4	158191	Why you were so weird .	I asked you about it .	when
0	120722	He was on the great journey .	The wolf was his companion not just any wolf , but the spirit wolf .	and
3	6604	With the rain and poor visibility , we have a very good chance that none of them will remember seeing us . '' .	The drivers were human .	if
0	155305	I chose my family . '' .	I 've never once regretted that .	and
0	88495	Victor and i ate a little bit of it .	Then i decided that i was too full to eat any more .	and
0	54674	Their armor was heavy .	Jon wondered how the soldiers could move at all while wearing it .	and
2	48071	I am secretive . '' .	It has nothing to do with being married .	but
2	50947	Just saying strange because i was sitting at the table with two witches , a vampire , and a keeper .	I was sitting at a table , getting ready to eat .	but
2	104673	The crowd encircling the pyre began to draw away as the heat intensified .	Tarquin remained there , now isolated , feeling the skin on his face drying out , becoming thin and taut , and his eyes smarting with the drifting smoke .	but
0	15801	Shed stated they were tired .	That theyd better get a good nights sleep , seeing as they had another long day ahead of them tomorrow .	and
2	52081	Sam debated whether to try to finish the cake before retiring , herself .	Decided that she was too tired .	but
0	134195	Sephrenia was sitting up in bed when they entered .	Xanetia was hovering protectively over her .	and
0	139287	What i 'm thinking .	I could be wrong .	and
1	17522	To create the special polymer spheres for the korean infection .	That was going to take a few days once the spheres were ready .	because
0	93987	Angell was looking at both then she sarcastic smiled .	Seeing their expression on their faces .	and
4	144347	Mucked on and i was not clean .	I got out of that swamp .	when
0	32729	Sliding across the table .	Smashing through the glass window .	and
0	31644	Despite the fact that i despise him , cameron is a very talented poet himself .	He 's kind of complimenting me .	and
0	68504	Never wavering , never faltering , never stopping until she dug her fingers into his shoulders tightened around his cock .	Cried out his name .	and
2	32706	Four years of her life she had wasted on him , on and off .	This was the end .	but
3	128412	He gave no notice .	He was aware of her scrutiny .	if
0	83212	Disregarding his words , sophie flailed her arms , holding the lower half of her body down with his knees , while he struggled her wrists into the cold , metal circles .	Kicked at him until he was forced to climb on top of her .	and
0	143873	It would only take him a few minutes to go into town .	Locate some unwary mortal .	and
3	79326	The courage will counteract the fear from the zombie .	I take a big enough dose .	if
4	113026	To ask the cause .	The former cavalry scout spoke up .	when
0	7994	Arthur , i was sure , had somehow been inside my head .	That was a troubling thought at best .	and
4	83328	As did the town .	They drove through it .	when
2	44245	Between light and dark again they no longer cared about the light .	Craved the darkness like the worst kind of drug .	but
4	17017	I was stunned at what i saw that it took a moment to register .	I pulled open the door .	when
3	118042	That 'd be a bad idea .	They were doing their primary work in the middle of it .	if
2	24222	She could have lived with the dirt and mud , with the tangles in her hair .	She desperately wanted to wash away her memories of the man who 'd abducted her sister , of the way he 'd pressed against her on the dirt bike , the feel of his hands around her neck , yanking her hair .	but
4	22837	I 'm crazy or deluded .	It comes to sarah .	when
2	33604	She was not covering herself in any way .	Awaiting the coming of her lover in the great marriage with as much composure as she could manage .	but
2	39697	For tonight though , i promise to be good . '' .	Only i already proved myself .	but
2	75565	Conor stared at the necklace .	He did not reach for it .	but
2	157326	It could not by any means have been confused with actually walking .	Max managed to support enough of his own weight that tavi 's strained body could manage the rest .	but
2	136459	She doesnt know me .	She knows me enough to consider me all right .	but
0	102238	I heard the squawking of a few chickens .	She emerged with a black one in her hands .	and
4	45550	I stop dead in my tracks .	I hear stephan ask the woman to come in so he can introduce his son to our father .	when
3	160534	And , then thomas and his friends had the same goals as the right arm .	It was true that wicked might begin the trials all over again with new immunes .	if
0	44639	The caffeine in her veins fizzed like carbonated water .	Her mind was full of darting images .	and
0	154886	We sing the song when we 're afraid .	Want to stir up our courage .	and
4	103622	I let out a sigh of relief .	The door closed behind them .	when
2	34447	It has all the hallmarks of an ira bombing .	They swear they werent involved .	but
4	131463	To check the mark .	Lisa walked over and signaled the shot was good .	when
0	141431	He pulled a tiny silver pen out of his pocket .	Held it up for her to see .	and
0	85239	If he had to sell his soul to keep his loved ones safe , he 'd draft the contract himself and .	Nail it to the devil 's forehead .	and
0	80794	Then , almost as if responding to a dare , she stood up .	Began to take off her clothes .	and
2	36479	The towns that make up napa valley may be large .	The community is small , and everyone seems to know each other .	but
2	4927	His shaved head gave him a dangerous air .	His striking features and dimples made her heart beat a little faster , and his warm smile put her at ease .	but
2	19386	I dont know what compelled me to do it .	I threw my face into blaines shirt and bawled for what seemed like .	but
2	75974	Gabe 's dad had managed to get him out on bail .	There was no arguing how bad he had hurt me and the police were looking at charging him with attempted murder .	but
0	113317	Finally the meal ended .	The whole group departed for tinehall .	and
0	50719	She kicked the gun out of his reach .	Lunged forward to stab the taser hard into the side of the man holding jazz to the side of the van .	and
3	27652	He then asked the boys .	They were into softcore or hardcore .	if
4	158082	The presidential vehicle was on elm street almost to the overpass followed in quick succession by two additional shots .	The first shot was fired .	when
0	156359	I pushed my chair out .	Went over to them .	and
4	1820	He never wanted anyone .	He was with her .	when
0	30209	The family gossip mill still turned .	Rumours of the treasure had grown for a while after our return .	and
0	79395	Brin smiled in unabashed excitement .	Hurried after their royal ringleader .	and
0	76141	Wrapping her in his arms dipping his chin to look down at her .	Pulling her deep in his body .	and
3	88259	You will never leave -- - '' howell placed a small recorder on the table .	Even i give you what you want .	if
0	121783	The beast rolled wildly , twisting free of bernard 's grip .	Scrambled at the forest floor with its powerful legs , to rise and sink its teeth into amara 's husband .	and
2	64776	Mine and her smile was tremulous .	It was a smile all the same .	but
0	47956	Yes , yes , the female traveller is trapped in an unrealised actuality .	Must be found because as she is right now , her being is draining the logos of the travellers .	and
0	87344	She brought both heels up as hard and fast as she could , her hips coming off the ground .	Knocked the vampire forward so that he lost his balance and jostled into the one who held her wrists .	and
4	2434	Unsure of how much time had actually passed , she was roused .	Jace 's hands slid back over her ass .	when
2	94872	They 'd been frantic for each other earlier .	That was just sex .	but
4	154908	Why they call 'em ufos .	They know they 're flying saucers .	when
1	39704	Which was fine by me .	I was so nervous .	because
0	97808	Her vision started to clear .	She could finally see the scene around her .	and
0	87728	That hung limply off its hinges .	Instead reached out his hand to touch one of the loosened bricks near the window .	and
0	76271	They had for the previous three days , to feed and water the beasts .	Stopping only once at midday .	and
0	22272	Their baby would have his smoky dark eyes or her green ones .	The babys chin would be strong like his or small like hers .	and
2	74388	She tried to steer around them .	There were so many .	but
4	83475	First , i was n't with you when you .	You were forced to either marry michael or be turned out on the street .	when
2	127317	She needed to grab tristan when he was alone to confront him about what had happened and give him back his drawings .	How to get him away from his friends .	but
2	74155	Finn headed in that direction .	I took one more look around before sliding my knife back up my sleeve , going over , and settling myself on the stool next to his .	but
2	43114	Not he was a night predator , and thomas ivan intended to do the same .	He was staking out alexandria houton as his territory .	but
2	54023	I realized i hadnt answered his question .	I was too scared to speak .	but
2	89260	Gideon and i would have to wade through the ugliness of my past .	For now , i could give us both something to smile .	but
2	86204	Her face was as unpleasant as mr. steel 's .	It was because of the sadness that shadowed hers .	but
0	19259	Rankin indeed had the leather hood which laurence had spoken of ; he had not liked it at all .	A heavy net with chains , such as temeraire had once been held down with , shipboard during a typhoon .	and
0	32309	Who whined in pain .	Gave him a warning growl .	and
3	67820	They would have something special for us .	We got the boots back to them today .	if
0	84294	But his feet were leaden .	Dorian could do nothing except watch her .	and
2	27924	I would end both our lives at this point . '' .	Until i know for a fact that war is contained and my son is safe , i 'm stuck .	but
2	160472	It was rough on my mom .	She never let it ruin her .	but
2	31209	Your man here won the first round .	We fight again in a month .	but
0	127898	All men must die . '' .	Women too ... but not all will be remembered .	and
2	112428	Over her black , well-pressed robes she wears the starched white apron of a nurse .	Around her waist is a bloodred belt showing the three black stars of domdaniel .	but
1	74106	It 's , or because you 're angry at him .	You expect him to walk in on us at any moment .	because
2	112228	She 's too good for this .	Now she 's involved .	but
0	84254	It grabs me shakes me .	`` i got ta get out of here , '' i struggle to make it to the window , but .	and
0	54328	His wingmen , adrian vogel and eddie blackhawk , were not happy with him .	Clearly the two of them were chewing him out in absentia .	and
3	119882	In the office , sean would be munching on cookies and using his smartphone to check in on customer bases and suppliers .	He were back home .	if
0	17613	Each man grabbed an item .	Headed for the rum barrels .	and
2	74867	Grabbing a package of instant mac and cheese , i started to pop it in the microwave .	Then stared down at my hands , frowning .	but
4	100256	My mom died , though i was only five .	I was a child .	when
4	106723	Ceres had no grimoire in his hands .	He cast the spell .	when
4	1418	It had been especially useful in council meetings .	We could communicate undetected with each other .	when
4	86689	The other had followed him .	He limped away , whining .	when
0	76226	As vejax recalled , daltera had been inducted as a guardian six seasons .	Was returning to lake arol for his first tour of duty as a trainer .	and
4	83783	I shall teach the classes and when i am not , hey , good artists are a dime a dozen and they work cheap .	I am in town .	when
2	63542	Thought i was putting my faith in providence .	Perhaps i was only covering my own fears .	but
3	74978	For now i must know .	You meant what you said about giving anything for two hands full of gold .	if
0	67739	Alexia had to give credit where it was due .	Her husband did have quite the splendid physique .	and
3	9903	This would all be easier to plan for .	She knew how events had gone in the hall .	if
2	8084	Whitney had no idea who this unidentified acquaintance could be .	She was very anxious to avoid further conversation about marriage with nicki .	but
4	34015	Chapter 60 mrs. ebner had just brought up tuna salad sandwiches from the cafeteria .	The doctor entered the waiting room .	when
3	84606	He 'd come find me . '' .	He wanted to know where i was .	if
0	1473	He sprang to his feet .	Shouted at the council .	and
0	14812	Besides , there are only so many ways to pick up a penny .	I 've done them all about a hundred and fifty thousand times at this point .	and
3	92908	She was at least going to enjoy herself .	She was going to spend all this time laying low .	if
4	103749	She scurried into the apartment , rolling her case inside and shutting the door behind her , all in one fluid movement .	She saw that it was andrew .	when
4	143077	I saw the same kind of robe .	We were ... in .	when
0	79300	But i never found him . '' .	Then i could not escape .	and
0	157518	Peeta and i will be introduced , the mayor of 11 will read a speech in our honor .	We 'll respond with a scripted thank-you provided by the capitol .	and
0	61234	Angrily , she hooked the necklace around her neck .	He wanted to shout with relief .	and
2	95559	I never used to understand why people bothered to hold hands as they walked , and i shiver and understand it .	Then he runs one of his fingertips down my palm .	but
4	8489	I decided it wouldnt hurt to see if we could set aside our differences .	She approached me after cheerleading practice .	when
2	13576	The next forty minutes seemed endless , and he just didnt have the strength to watch her slowly die , no matter what the circumstances .	He knew he should be sitting up next to her , getting every second he could by her side .	but
2	54877	His tone was soft .	Each word was edged in ice .	but
3	110126	`` may i have two apples and two carrots ? '' .	You can spare them .	if
2	158183	My memories are different .	I dont know if yours are the same as mine .	but
0	98782	You are unpredictable , so you will have more energy for later . '' .	You have an easy group in the first round .	and
0	33031	He weighed a ton .	She was pretty sure it was all muscle .	and
2	150293	Lance just told her he could as easily get killed driving on the boulder turnpike .	She didnt want him to quit visiting her anymore did she .	but
0	131217	My wife be called elpin .	She be the best wife a man could have .	and
2	84496	Terri was still talking in his ear .	He hardly heard her .	but
0	79353	I set my teacup down rose .	Took my foot off murphy 's coffee table .	and
2	37404	I took a few steps through the smothering atmosphere , trying to locate her by sound .	The deadening effect of the crumbling blocks hid her movements from me .	but
0	120516	Later , after the three of them had climbed up into the loft durnik kept stored up .	Rolled themselves into blankets on the pallets .	and
4	148753	Should we get in a discussion about people wanting to whack you ? '' .	We can be overheard in a departure lounge or on a plane .	when
2	129443	It was lit , all the way to the top floor .	There was not a soul to see .	but
3	6946	I 'll fill up the tank . '' .	You let me take the neon .	if
2	59272	Like you said once , i 'm alive .	I 'm not living .	but
0	140686	Several warships were breaking orbit , speeding away from the planet .	Rushing headlong toward the sun .	and
4	96771	One of them would slip , and they would bristle at each other until heather or alexis changed the subject .	Just things would settle .	when
2	127547	To argue with him .	Just then sarah walks into the room .	but
0	40253	So he turned into the fields , and more than one enjoyable fight with other dogs , and several hurried flights from larger dogs .	Had many wild adventures of the bird and rabbit sort in an aimless kind of way .	and
2	54719	Four previous investigators had come here and .	Returned to report `` no crime '' when all surface evidence pointed to something profoundly wrong in fraffin 's private empire .	but
0	18338	An ache welled up behind her eyes .	A sense of cooperation and obedience gripped her mind like a vise .	and
0	64859	Cherise grabbed my arm , locked eyes with me .	Panted , `` run .	and
3	104419	Closing her eyes and clenching her fists .	The anger inside her had to be released before she could say another word .	if
4	142974	Saw sir only on those infrequent occasions .	The old man chose to descend into the main part of the house .	when
0	15017	Maybe those gods had a reason for creating this hidden world .	How would i know about that .	and
2	117910	I check out the menu .	There are no macarons on it .	but
4	100535	He said , `` is this too soon ? '' .	They stopped to breathe .	when
4	148616	That he had taken her hint .	He 'd been thinking about kissing her .	when
2	99737	There were a bunch of scientific possibilities .	A feeling gnawed at me .	but
2	34367	Sparky was fairly certain that they were lost .	Regardless he continued driving , trying his best to remember the route basil had laid out for him .	but
0	52702	He felt utterly comfortable with her .	When he thought of something happening to her , his mind went blank white with rage .	and
0	62971	Being on earth , dylan i had found a new place to stay ; and .	Katy started paying me to work .	and
1	106880	At some point , maddox must 've shifted .	He was in his true form .	because
2	18455	The model had no purpose to start with .	Then began to turn into a fantasy topsy-turvy village .	but
2	82280	I 'd started reading when i was home to try to bore myself to sleep .	I 'd ended up staying up all night and kind of liking the books .	but
0	70998	When he had come home from his walk .	Found his mother laying at the bottom of the stairs .	and
0	8517	Them morph into bloody , battered humans .	Crawl into their vehicles .	and
0	2180	He walked like him .	Wore his hair long like him .	and
3	139339	I could sometimes settle whatever was bothering me . '' .	I could free my mind for even a few minutes .	if
1	15410	Ari was also relieved .	In amongst it al , she 'd begun to doubt which feelings were truly her own .	because
4	32650	The popping sound of gravel under the tires came to a slow stop .	It reached a wide dirt path on the right .	when
4	101292	Her face was ravaged .	She opened the door .	when
0	110774	We entered the room .	Wasted no time turning .	and
3	76726	How beautiful it would be , each of us in our own bedroom intensely thinking of the other , my sweetheart .	I did it too at the same time .	if
4	20987	Shed been on duty in the clinique .	Peasants had been carried inbruised , bayonetted and violated .	when
2	25495	The gray-haired older man could be thoughtless .	He had always been kind to her , at least he had been .	but
4	33784	We noticed that isabel had found lots of food and had assembled a makeshift meal on the table .	We went into the kitchen .	when
0	85309	Kyle puts his hand on duncans shoulder , and the only thing we can do is keep moving .	Replies , it already happened .	and
2	37365	I hear your words and i can not make myself believe that anything like this could ever happen .	Can even imagine the concept you describe .	but
1	45760	Striker hadnt killed me that day .	Tanya had promised her dad that she wouldnt meet me ever again and that she would convince me that we were not meant to be .	because
0	57857	Let 's just get it done . '' .	Then we can run like hell .	and
4	41340	Nearly breaking the g-string .	I accidentally put both legs into the same hole .	when
3	93849	Imagine , how much more accommodating the world , and america , could be . '' .	That was no longer needed .	if
0	33546	King suddenly cleared his throat .	Threw a giant wall between us .	and
0	106937	Instead , i pulled her against me whispered into her ear .	Kissed her on the cheek .	and
2	80319	When poligny had wished to reprimand her in private for a certain practical joke she had played on one of the meaner chorus girls .	It had looked so plain and boring thennow , with messieurs richard and moncharmin in command .	but
2	91200	Posthypnotic suggestion , left by the hypnotizer and later executed by the human mind as its own idea , simply eliminates this signal of pain .	Doesnt remove the cause of the disease .	but
2	109672	For a moment , i wonder if i imagined the entire exchange .	I see the crushed cigarette still on the ground .	but
0	68445	I had to always have control .	Be very careful in bed .	and
0	134623	A sweat-streaked fireman appeared at the window , reaching for carly .	Then another fireman came behind him .	and
0	79767	She was a health nut .	Had survived for several weeks on bottled water and bulk granola or some other kind of healthy crap .	and
0	24800	Seizing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a sitting position .	Tore the bandage off his head .	and
2	109799	I wished there was a better way i could have done that .	There really was n't . .	but
2	3045	Damien 's parole hearing might have been the catalyst .	Kevin was the one who had enacted the thaw of her chilled emotions .	but
0	141464	He pulled his hand out of her shirt .	Passed it over his face .	and
4	59133	They were almost at the front door .	A voice suddenly called out behind them .	when
2	81767	The only guards they had seen were two standing outside the cabin door .	They didnt know if there were any inside the cabin .	but
4	78841	So neither did i. cathy and i were rounding the turn on the track .	The boys jogged across the field to the waiting busses .	when
4	73031	He sat in the dark until nine , and then went into the bedroom .	The sun was gone .	when
4	75265	Vicki was on her way home .	She saw mrs. heath outside watering her lawn .	when
0	28015	Gisbo turned to see falcon leaning against a large stalagmite , arms folded .	Smiling at their little group .	and
0	124160	But still , even though the weather was worsening , they were later expected .	No call had come to explain why .	and
0	39689	He returned to his victim .	Dragged him down a set of stone stairs to a far corner of the basement , where he intended to interrogate him .	and
0	102429	The top of her head was right below his chin .	Then he spoke as he stretched his legs out .	and
2	80296	Sweat dripped freely off his body from the exertion .	Still he continued since he could only rely on himself .	but
3	114636	Somehow , he would keep his hands off her .	That was truly what she wanted .	if
2	64667	The sorcerer was old and stank like he had been rolling around in a grave .	Had to ride a wagon .	but
0	138360	When he carefully poked his head out into the corridor again , the man had disappeared .	It was impossible to know down which of those dark side passageways he had gone .	and
0	63552	He excused himself with a smile .	Abruptly disappeared behind a truck while pulling out a handkerchief from his pants pocket .	and
4	159191	Sean was pushing through the crowd , hell-bent on reaching the door .	He suddenly stopped dead in his tracks .	when
4	149580	A few weeks ago .	The executive elevator accidentally stopped on the second floor while mike was waiting for the staff elevator .	when
0	50420	The plaza was empty .	She found a parking spot near the front of the belowground garage .	and
1	132145	Leaning against the desk , i fought to keep a stupid smile off my face ... and kiss her .	I really wanted to get my hands all over her right .	because
0	125807	Strewn across some scrubby plants near the truck .	Then sat on dry boulders in silence .	and
0	51778	Jane meant to send them more eggs , laurence knew , but the yellow reaper perhaps the most critical .	These three had been intended as the foundation .	and
4	121456	The three of them disappeared behind the principals closed door .	Mrs. standish rushed in a few seconds .	when
2	137381	I know you 're angry because amanda is so torn .	He needs to get to her to fix this .	but
3	92827	Hey look haley started in , irritated , when her father cut her off .	Youre still having issues with my getting to climb this peak instead of you .	if
4	94063	To reassemble the thing .	Gavin and i materialized next to her .	when
0	52785	Himself sliding one of his big hands around her thin neck .	Running it up until it was stopped by the shelf of her jaw .	and
3	138853	You will be shot at .	You lay a finger on this farmer , or on anyone .	if
3	80148	It 'll be quicker . '' .	We toss both of em at .	if
3	26660	To be really full .	He was going to resist the temptation of ravens blood .	if
0	30212	The sound of crunching leaves and labored breathing filled the warm autumn air .	Celaena kept her gaze on the damp and gleaming dark hair of the thief in front of her .	and
4	8033	She created a special connection and he was seeing what was happening to her .	She connected to him when he was captured .	when
2	156804	The cancer was bad enough , and the scare had put them all on edge .	They 'd very nearly lost her last fall .	but
0	86022	Chad turned to riyan .	Said , you better try the sword .	and
0	116871	Who yelled already rising for the strike .	Spun around with his sword .	and
0	86448	Molly gripped my hand .	I could tell she was shivering .	and
1	55139	Blake does not tell you . ' .	It will grieve you .	because
2	64234	Nothing was ever proven .	Neither was it disproven .	but
4	33413	Even crossed my mind .	I came in tonight .	when
3	8162	My sister and i would have suffered a fate far worse than we did at his hands . '' .	He were half so bad as that .	if
2	147962	Not he particularly cared .	He felt he needed to say something-anything-to take his mind off the tedious wait .	but
2	69913	The area in his mind that had given him the immense outline still holds its shape .	The shape is empty .	but
0	4485	For the briefest of moments , his expression shifted into pain and self-loathing .	Guilt rushed through me as i nearly took it .	and
2	97227	He wanted to say something in his defence .	There was nothing to say , and all he could do was to stare in stupefaction at the stranger .	but
0	73633	The rest of the group decided it was better to get to a village with a healer faster .	Worry about the assassins when they got .	and
0	120431	It made the scholar wince .	Reminded him sharply that he must teach her to do that more .	and
2	122465	True , he missed the capital , its discreet bars with obliging male companionship .	He had grown to like his peaceful existence amongst the cacophony of boys in cornwall .	but
0	104757	The crooked shadows of skeletal branches waved across the floor and pews like somebody beckoning somebody .	I sat there alone , gazing at nothing and everything , one shadow in particular seemed to come alive in the far corner of the room .	and
2	105294	Normally i 'd reveal some part of my body .	We were on camera .	but
2	141808	He swung down over the horse .	When she started to follow , he put his hand on her thigh to stop her .	but
0	131047	The flare gun tumble .	Roll down the steep , gravelly hill .	and
4	145392	She was amazed by the things hed done in the special forces .	She was first asked about him by an fbi investigator .	when
4	119532	I congratulated him , and he seemed genuinely touched that i 'd been in the stands .	A lacrosse game went .	when
2	11383	All not dying have ever encountered .	Instead growing up to be the best-natured cat i .	but
3	154741	It would be great .	He and iona paired up .	if
3	128003	Of course , you probably have only a vague idea what a car is in the first place , since you 're used to much larger vehicles .	You 're from the free kingdoms .	if
2	1157	They would probably be irritated about it .	Fire watches came natural to me given my military experience .	but
2	22104	She scrunches up her face .	She doesnt slap either of them .	but
3	85965	I would never get them back on .	I took my boots off .	if
3	14859	They had a pam now , and they wrote to him as well , and blamed him for everything .	Even they got their tails nipped by their own pet lobsters .	if
3	38894	He could quench the relentless thirst that burned through him ... mariah 's laughter rang off the stone walls as erik tugged against the chains .	He could just reach the man .	if
0	57683	Who 'd had sex .	Happened to be side by side .	and
2	76694	Chapter twelve merit 's deep , dark ( 72 % cocoa ) secret it was nearly midnight when i made it to wicker park .	I got lucky , finding a corner grocery with its neon open sign still blazing in the window .	but
2	6903	I hear voices and noises .	They come to me from a thousand miles .	but
0	148812	He dropped down behind the logs .	Saw his grinning grandfather clearing the field in front of them .	and
2	108529	The first thirty or forty of the enemy were driven off .	There were simply too many of them for the knights aeris to reach them all .	but
3	31631	It was doing a really good job of that fakery .	Indeed , the ice cream parlor was fake .	if
0	146697	He paused on first spotting her , moved to the refrigerator .	Then murmured a greeting .	and
4	98686	Its common in cases .	We have a domestic violence call .	when
3	141531	Feel free to come to me .	You have any problems .	if
0	142905	Now he 's not getting his way , so he 's out to get me one way or another . '' .	It 's pissing him off .	and
2	141966	We came into a room that was as crowded as the others , and the air was nice and warm .	It had big latticed windows and the late sunlight was pouring in .	but
0	66978	I hear the sound system at the cafe belting out gospel music .	Can see a huge crowd gathering along .	and
4	51228	I barely kept my composure , and i watched his ripped arms vibrate with the movement of it .	He used the mixer .	when
0	68440	Next morning tamy woke up .	Stepped to the kitchen .	and
2	80782	He expected to find .	Instead was faced with the woman from the back of the church .	but
2	69954	His name was known , then , as one of the less perfect pupils .	He was suffered because of the lack of evidence against him which , had it ever materialised , might have led to a speedy expulsion .	but
4	95531	He could hear the titan speaking , addressing the five privates who stared up at her in rapt horror .	The pressure relented and the world came .	when
2	150951	I 'd much rather ride you . '' .	Hey , i can adapt to anything you throw my way .	but
2	52688	My back bristled , waiting for someone to talk .	I held my tongue .	but
2	111234	Then i think again and .	I know exactly why i 'm doing it .	but
0	143087	* * * * * * * serot creeps up on the ninja .	Holds his mouth shut , until ryu and cross are out of range .	and
1	61043	I love you , but you 're really a big ol ' softie inside . '' .	You look and act like this big macho guy .	because
4	32822	She got this kind of faraway look in her eyes .	I said that and i wondered what happened the time they had been alone at sam 's .	when
0	114489	Sure enough , strips of frayed canvas sail were wrapped tightly around her chest .	Any doubts mary still had about the pirates gender dissolved .	and
0	5935	Despite my familys exile , i have managed to keep a lot of lands .	A lot of wealth be more specific .	and
0	94062	Spector opened the slip of paper .	Held it up to the light to read .	and
0	84582	The shudders go through temeraire 's body as they stood their unpleasant guard choiseul made a desperate attempt to persuade him to accept the shelter lenton had offered .	Forced to observe while praecursoris swung his head from side to side in denial .	and
4	91158	I told her that i was staying at tremonte for a few days while my condo was repainted .	My mom picked up .	when
1	97657	Glancing back at his confused family , she followed .	She had no choice .	because
3	96580	I am sorry - `` `` temeraire is neither my pet nor my property , sir .	You have made such a pet of the creature you can not bear to lose him .	if
3	51929	Though there 's no way i can taste it to see how it turns out .	I 'm trying a new recipe .	if
2	121742	No one should bother you and i guess you changed your mind .	You guys were going to go .	but
0	97175	Like , we went through the stuff in your songbook .	They are just some of the most morbid and depressing things .	and
2	136141	His mother could not have known .	An image of sylvie jumped into his mind .	but
2	89890	The cuff slips out of his grip , and .	Instead of waiting for it to pendulum back to where he can grab it , burny leans farther .	but
2	74761	Gray , i think that you made yourself shift .	You did it because he ordered you to .	but
2	13581	At that point , it was a wake-up call for me , and .	I was hoping it would do the same for you .	but
3	56447	I shall laugh a lot . '' .	Things get too hot .	if
2	86142	I want to do all that with you , '' and i go , `` i know you do .	Look at it this way-how great of an organizer am i .	but
2	104306	A few more painful seconds went by .	He did not reappear out of the crowd .	but
4	75650	The female was trembling , and trying not to show it .	She turned back to her mother .	when
0	25542	To explain in front of him .	Simply dropped to her knees .	and
3	28904	They would go back into the desert .	They are not compensated .	if
2	52380	The kitchen was small , and boasted state-of-the-art fixtures and appliances .	Was remodeled before i moved in .	but
3	18648	Men total chaos would ensue and the traditional constraints would be unworkable .	Women had the same drive .	if
0	119896	It was all over his face .	Pouring from his eyes .	and
3	137653	You could become extinct .	You go in there .	if
0	108200	To do so would mean he would have to resign himself to working the rest of his life .	That was something he was not prepared to do .	and
0	75940	Yeah , before mama passed , you would come in with your guitar .	Get together with folks .	and
2	4395	He taught me . '' .	It only works with touch .	but
2	78577	In broken , subservient women enticed the blackness and i was also stronger than i 'd ever been .	Made me tremble with sick wanting .	but
4	57379	She saw that his dark brows had shot up even farther at her declaration .	She opened her eyes .	when
2	127526	Someone will get to you .	I can protect you .	but
4	117922	Chapter 15 rachel was nearly aglow with delight .	Sarah came down to eat the next morning .	when
0	121924	Kylie 's breath caught .	She looked at derek .	and
4	66499	Silence claimed the steak house .	He moved on to explain the third device .	when
0	19043	She hurried past them .	He caught a whiff of ... blood .	and
2	73036	The doctor nodded , turning .	He continued to speak rapidly , lecturing as if still in his classroom at the university of stockholm .	but
2	5545	Pointblank had wiped off the blade of his knife .	The marshal 's blood still stained the handle as well as his fingers .	but
0	87632	A little bit of mascara and some bright pink lip gloss .	I was ready to go .	and
2	30937	He knew shade couldnt understand her words .	He also flipped on his back and they laughed .	but
0	73248	He walked out the front door of the center a short time .	Got into the driver 's seat of the maserati .	and
3	121857	You can feel it - like an intuition , i guess . '' .	You 're sensitive to such things .	if
3	38151	He could bed a different woman every night .	The ladies constantly subjected him to come-ons .	if
0	28573	I 'd go do my meditation and connection with the land .	Then head back to tucson .	and
2	23904	He was not alone in his experience .	How did will know about all of this .	but
2	102137	I was expecting to meet him secretly on the observation deck after the show .	He did not arrive .	but
4	41434	Jake felt safe and cared-for .	He was with the old man .	when
0	97304	Here and there buckling towers reeled drunkenly against the morning sky .	Broken pillars jutted up among the decaying walls .	and
3	98154	Then any possible rudeness was irrelevant .	He really wanted a window to her thoughts .	if
0	144448	He took luther 's arm .	Teleported them both out of .	and
2	72856	It was may very well be a one day op .	With this war , you never knew .	but
3	37081	A trash bin to move it .	To she did pick it up .	if
1	147485	It 's practically impossible to get it to see .	The blasted thing can see .	because
2	50682	He pulled on his jacket .	Did not bother to fasten it .	but
4	35017	How he had found hope and direction .	His mind had lost its own .	when
4	86708	`` is your nose broken ? '' .	I at last calmed down , i asked .	when
3	23979	I 'd grow sick .	I looked at it .	if
3	130394	It is a sign of weakness and they are branded an outcast , they must leave the tribe .	They do not fight for their mate .	if
2	30480	The water was freezing .	She put her hands in and began to scrub with the sand from the bottom .	but
2	54233	We had all survived .	The fear was still there deep inside me .	but
0	154310	Carvings of the heralds now lined the inside walls .	Broad windows carved on the leeward side had been set with glass to let in the light .	and
2	37192	The red cappies she was wearing looked oddly dull in this light .	They were still the brightest things in eddie 's view ... until he looked down at his own feet and saw the street-boppers with their cuban heels .	but
0	47904	Sean 's nostrils flared .	His eyes went white .	and
0	79980	Instead , i follow nev toward the beach .	Instinctively know where we 're headed .	and
4	66105	I knew why i liked frank beamon .	I got off the phone .	when
2	59410	I was going to show it to you earlier .	After we stopped here the first time , i wanted to wait until i heard what judy had to say .	but
2	32505	It would be uncomfortable for those dancers .	Still they whirled and bent , swung their arms and their hair in the frenzy of their dedication .	but
0	87528	Varg let out a roar of rage .	What seemed to fidelias like pure , joyous enthusiasm , struck down a second vord , and covered the fallen warrior as he rose and retrieved his weapon .	and
3	81638	I 'd probably be nervous , but this just felt right .	I 'd had any energy left in my body .	if
4	140697	He experienced a moment of panic , leaving him alone in the now-empty office .	She closed the door behind her .	when
2	154082	Titus had already been older and not so interested in developing a relationship with the very married mechanic .	Bax was a different story .	but
4	117552	Why did you help day escape .	You knew that he 's wanted for so many crimes against the republic .	when
2	17921	It went on its neatly numbered way , day or night .	She could never help a shiver at the thought that one night she would walk that road and end up .	but
2	117848	She 's unsteady , and .	She refuses to walk up the stairs .	but
2	74381	I slip back into my room and my heart 's sinking .	Snatch the sonnet from my desk .	but
0	68587	He sat in the back .	Stared out the window behind him .	and
2	52582	Not only would i be turning down the chance to work with oliver .	I would probably lose my job anyway if i didnt do this for them .	but
2	91185	It was only seven in the evening and she had no place she could think of to go .	She didnt feel like staying in her room .	but
4	12340	He was caught off guard by the way tasha and brandywine was chatting and laughing .	He returned to the kitchen .	when
0	36177	Why they were in place .	How the hierarchy of enforcement operated .	and
4	152172	He would forgive her .	He saw tears rolling down her face .	when
3	100577	How would they react after the town erupted to the news .	The girls were already losing control .	if
2	8601	I started to argue .	He held up a hand .	but
2	56108	I have never been so hurt in my life , and todays craziness only confirms what derek is , which i wont even write here , what he is .	It starts with an a .	but
2	79771	They cleaned up the blood .	They carved her face down to that .	but
3	123634	`` , i 'd agree .	These actually said something useful .	if
0	37921	The two hopeless children tidied their materials in a corner of the porch .	Followed mrs. joaquin out of the house .	and
0	103975	I think it will be another hour or two before we are close enough to even shout such questions at him , monika said .	Then they continued down , now racing to reach the figure coming up to meet them .	and
2	97663	We 've changed our encryption since .	That 's no guarantee .	but
2	81854	Thank you for the invitation . '' .	Right now i 'm so busy i barely have time to tie my shoes .	but
0	3361	Richard felt the rooftop with his hands .	Felt the solid structure beneath him .	and
2	89805	I know labour was exhausted and useless .	People voted the other lot in out of greed and self interest , or what they thought was self interest .	but
2	1375	It might not be .	There was only one way to find out .	but
0	67996	It was , the wheels were turning .	I did a dance of joy inside from having just snagged a wealth of pull quotes from that one long , surprisingly heartfelt ramble .	and
1	10195	That 's okay . '' .	That 's all i can think .	because
0	124875	Her life was poised right on the head of a pin .	What she did next would either catapult her forward or send her back to her apartment and a sad bottle of tequila for comfort .	and
3	61779	What i would do .	I faced such a thing .	if
2	133808	The residents had repeatedly asked for a laser printer .	Each time teresa had advised them that it was `` impossible '' .	but
3	144217	To come to dalcrest as the kitsune had come to fel 's church .	They were able to cross over .	if
2	129662	I know there are exercises she 'll need to do ? '' .	Has anyone asked her what she likes to do .	but
4	12973	Adsen replaced the vial over an open flame and put the plunger back in the syringe .	The small reservoir was full .	when
2	117727	I know it 's barely afternoon . '' .	I want the band far enough from that village not to be threatening , but close enough that a few of us can go down to feel things out .	but
0	36718	Lana sniffed her hair .	Did not like the smell of smoke caught in the strands .	and
0	74585	He went out the diner 's front door .	Circled back through the parking lot , which was the only way to reach the restrooms at the rear of the building .	and
2	70491	Maybe it was his injuries .	Jasmine suspected it had more to do with her presence in his bed .	but
3	139293	It wouldnt have happened .	He had seen both of us .	if
3	75736	They 're gon na have to kill me quickly while i 'm unsuspecting . '' .	They ever have a problem with me .	if
3	94469	Id check the place out , but somehow i dont think your dad would approve .	I were here with a couple of guys .	if
0	87977	The window of opportunity was only two weeks .	The price for cash-in value was double .	and
3	70908	`` would you have believed me ? '' .	I 'd said i did .	if
4	23933	The heavily weathered and severely weakened safety belt held together but the equally weathered and rotted undead baby did n't . .	The shopping cart crashed .	when
4	112692	Where miss annalee hyatts daughter hailed .	She came to visit pegramville .	when
0	64661	Katy has proven to have some issues . '' .	Can become very dangerous .	and
2	104499	He smiles as he says it , and .	The pressure in my chest eases some .	but
4	89158	You can be sure im serious .	I say a little bird told me .	when
2	122056	He was afraid when he missed one and it entered through his back .	It merely warmed his inside before diminishing .	but
0	56793	The tunnel flues had drawn the smoke into the darkness .	We hoped that it would disperse before it emerged .	and
2	124230	I might even throw up . '' .	I 'm going to try to get us in .	but
0	132393	The kernel had a toughly soft consistency , rather like cork or kidneys .	The flavour , though somewhat austere and prosaic after the fruit of the floating islands , was not unsatisfactory .	and
3	70721	`` and you could have been injured , or arrested . '' .	The police had happened by .	if
2	123923	The stuff the nurse gave him seemed to help .	I could tell it didnt make it go .	but
0	36890	That always hovered there .	Bounced wildly across the circle sea .	and
1	21032	One report stuck in his mind .	For once , it had been properly investigated - cambodia and millions of dollars of funds for mosquito nets .	because
3	3167	To remain in the world .	It could be used against someone .	if
3	72945	He could bring a woman .	He needed to ( cash had joanne , after all ) but i intended on keeping my spot at the head of the pack .	if
2	77298	To miss this place .	Being poor now im going to have to get used to drinking at home .	but
2	155207	I will come visit you often , and . '' .	I promise you will never be .	but
2	93783	Followed from a safe distance .	When he arrived at his home doug drove on past it a few blocks .	but
2	125213	It may have seemed odd to think in such terms .	There was a basic theoretical approach dealing with how and why we could already have been .	but
2	133541	They might still get the data out , it was the point of the games and the whole system was built on that premise .	There was nothing we could do about that .	but
4	140137	To sew him up in his hammock .	He 's dead and put the cannonball in to make him sink .	when
4	29983	Hundreds of thousands of men looked like quite a lot of men .	You saw them close to .	when
2	141532	I tried to contact you so many times .	She was always in the way .	but
2	11350	I could hear a car coming in the distance .	I knew it would just speed past .	but
2	37359	Raymond never dug abe 's pretentious humor .	He got the point .	but
2	19476	She would love to be someone 's dream .	Doubted seriously if that would ever be .	but
2	1470	He tried to mount .	The horse , sensing its riders nerves , shied and sidestepped .	but
0	149307	She continued to press the boundaries of my comfort by ignoring my personal space .	Enjoyed it when i would get uncomfortable .	and
4	62037	A moment later , he sucked in his breath .	He felt her hands on his bare chest .	when
2	78622	Tyler can head over there , be your eyes and ears . '' .	You 're not putting yourself in danger .	but
0	38978	Barbara was mary anns friend .	Told the girl bully all that matthew was telling her in confidence .	and
4	150085	To take a little extra care .	Assembling the particular piece upon which he was currently working as they would be doing their testing of the device live , without wires or safety nets of any kind .	when
2	40954	Unless you were looking specifically for it then you would not have noticed .	The two girls rose a few inches off the floor and slowly began to rotate .	but
1	86025	He warned us not to cross the colonnades .	He knew what we would face on the other side .	because
2	116642	I know you lost our bet . '' .	Considering the circumstances it 's the least we can do .	but
4	146756	You can have the lady .	I have the money .	when
4	129797	Kent had told them .	She 'd had no choice but to break her long silence over the growing problems in their marriage .	when
0	151314	It was a mostly industrial area .	While there were plenty of cars , she was the only one on the sidewalk .	and
3	46933	I 'll throw in a free golf cart . '' .	You sign the contract .	if
2	46359	Sam almost dropped the knife .	His left hand steadied his right , both palms now clutching the hilt .	but
2	71963	He reared back to give jase the same treatment .	Jase 's aim was better this time .	but
1	8772	It 's impossible to compare one to the other .	They 're so different and have an appeal of their own .	because
2	30911	My jaw was gaping .	I stared at zane 's hand and pointed .	but
2	100082	Earth remained difficult for her .	She was getting markedly better with air and fire .	but
2	6993	Terra wanted to believe him .	Something held her back .	but
3	97057	You cant afford it , please , please , please , spread the word .	You borrowed this book or shared it .	if
3	139745	Preferably the mills , then he would have an element of surprise , for surely the three would be expecting him to be limited to a ground approach .	Only there were a way he could get on top of one of those rooftops without being seen .	if
0	88474	Tolya 's face went dark .	He pounded one of his giant fists down on the table .	and
0	114163	It was my choice .	The consequences were mine to bear .	and
0	153690	Instead of the vaults and domes on the first floor , the ceiling here was lower , flatter .	Covered in patterned plaster .	and
0	93435	Crossing the room , i picked alex .	Settled him on my hip .	and
0	98572	As dearly as he cared for her , she always made matters so complicated .	Tended to get even more frustrated than he did when plans went .	and
3	59891	`` , too , i 'll lose control . '' .	I hear that you want me .	if
2	6687	Jon bostoff did not hold a warm place in his heart for her .	Maybe , just maybe , she could manage to change his mind by turning jon 's wife into an ally .	but
2	75468	But sometimes the leap from fact to fiction is clear in my mind .	Is irreconcilable to the user as presented .	but
0	122068	Instead , she ripped from his grasp .	Sprinted down the hall .	and
4	55092	She 'd made up for it .	She met gary , who sold medical supplies to group wellness , where lorraine worked .	when
2	44858	She dismissed the offer at the time . '' .	I believe she may have reconsidered , as distasteful as she finds it .	but
4	25944	The delight i felt .	I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds .	when
2	149242	Highjump was a polar training exercise , coupled with a mission to map the continent .	Most of his expedition 's objectives were kept top secret .	but
2	30279	The streets were packed with cars and taxis ; i guess i was just being paranoid like kira said , but the feeling of being watched wouldnt leave me .	There was no sign of him .	but
0	19230	I 'm not , then i 've been drinking blood for nothing .	Went through that whole we 're going to decide if you live or die crap for nothing .	and
2	112294	Fierce , internal battle rages every time i 'm forced to suck up to this thug .	I have no choice .	but
0	65503	A moment later , she groaned .	Swung back to face him .	and
3	91287	They 're doomed . '' .	They stay where they are .	if
0	6442	Just before he sauntered away , jack winked at me .	Slapped cole hard on the shoulder .	and
4	144943	And we have a chance to fight or outrun anyone .	We 're on my turf .	when
2	8734	I knew that the trapline described a rough circle .	Had no idea precisely how many snares there were .	but
0	80970	On monday one came down the greenway , they say ; . ' .	Another appeared later , coming up the greenway from the south .	and
3	6420	He hastily adds , `` i 'm sure with you it was different .	Realizing that he has maybe insulted me .	if
3	138668	The guilt threatened to eat me alive .	I looked at it .	if
4	36920	I thought i would remember what it was like to be human .	I had imagined this moment .	when
4	111483	He could minimize it .	He felt the need .	when
2	84811	They fought on a daily basis .	Their fights never lasted more than ten minutes and always ended in everyone else within seeing distance yelling at them to get a room while they attacked each other with lips and searching hands .	but
3	7348	To let me know .	You need any maintenance work .	if
2	73177	Mockery was not in drades nature .	He was feeling a little under-utilized at the moment , and from time to that he felt the need to remind people what a true polymath he was .	but
3	82694	Persephone 's real worry was that her own days were numbered .	I had to guess .	if
4	81835	He turned his head as if to throw this voice in the other direction .	Kane looked up and saw me coming .	when
0	93603	Wriggling again , i tried to pull the neckline up to something approaching respectable .	Wondered if i could get away with wearing something .	and
0	1838	Beating harder than hes ever felt .	It felt like it would literally beat out of his chest .	and
2	133061	She had overestimated his kindness and understanding of her .	Then again she had slapped him in the face .	but
3	44271	She 'll ... not like it .	You do anything to me .	if
4	61451	`` caid '' was hop , `` fuckin ' shit .	I heard him mutter .	when
2	53336	`` i 'm glad you think so , jocelyn , '' he said , then looked across the room at sophie .	Put his arm back up on the mantle .	but
0	10227	He waved her away as he began walking towards the terrace .	She watched his back as he walked .	and
2	5348	I 'm afraid i 'm seeing imaginary things .	No , her message is .	but
0	106607	But my own great-great-great-granddaughter assures me of the truth of it ? '' .	Why should she lie .	and
3	81818	Father , the darkness is going to use you to destroy us all . '' .	You fail in this .	if
2	142719	He starts to run around sterling .	Sterling restrains him until men in green arrive to take him .	but
2	74143	I 'd take higgins .	He is not here , worse luck , as i miss him .	but
0	124912	One of the dorms suffered a terrible fire a year .	As a result , all of the juniors and seniors lived in ten houses one street .	and
2	125788	The inn was well maintained - unlike most of the houses in the area .	The coating was lacking several locations , indicating that the building had not been renovated for a few years .	but
2	156040	A windmill would work , maybe , to pump water into the system .	If i want hot water , there would be steam anyway-why not use it .	but
2	72043	Benedict 's voice had gone hard and commanding .	For the first time there was fear in his voice .	but
2	42880	The hex is powered by anger .	I see no sign of anger on wayne .	but
2	45014	I 'd have given you a wake-up call . '' .	There 's no phone service .	but
2	135268	I hated that word .	That 's exactly what she was .	but
0	132327	The mogs have ropes around his horns .	Are dragging him out of the corner .	and
0	99001	* * * patricia placed her arms around leonards neck .	Fixed her gaze on nora when the blonde quentin passed them on her way out of the schools football stadium after practice .	and
2	75200	He reluctantly released his bite .	He remained aching and stiff inside her , still needing to drive into her .	but
0	43158	He was clumsy , howard replied for ernie .	Tripped in his apartment .	and
4	69115	She did not resist .	Pirmin took her hand and kissed it .	when
0	90717	When i was out , i let go of his hand , coughing .	Fell to my knees .	and
2	31656	His hair is all buzzed off .	Surprisingly , it looks good on him .	but
3	113533	`` is it cool ? '' .	He hangs out here until i 'm done .	if
1	70641	My dad doing warm-ups inside the gym .	It 's too cold to be outside .	because
0	137640	I 'll be along in just a few moments . ' .	That 's when things will start .	and
2	44138	He lay on top of her and teasing , taunting , building her up .	Pressed himself against her , not entering her .	but
0	124007	Ever they fled they cast fearful glances back of them .	Finally they stopped near clayton jabbering excitedly to her as though to warn her of approaching danger .	and
2	128745	Magic was mostly gone from arria , although some people still had the gift .	Only used it for basic things , like lighting candles .	but
1	106622	It would have been better to just trip , fall , and look like a fool , or maybe that would have gotten me killed .	It would have shown weakness .	because
3	136429	I would only want more and more .	I got a taste of alexis .	if
0	138964	It pulled at her from the inside out .	As the falling sensation slowed , she reached out for it , eager for more .	and
4	27624	I punched him in the sore spot .	So he turned around in his locker .	when
2	96682	Desandra flexed , trying to break free .	The vines gripped her .	but
0	93031	People like bastille spend years practicing inside of their city kingdom , training their bodies , bonding to their swords , learning to use warrior 's lenses .	Finally being implanted with a certain magical crystal .	and
0	70962	In a few short years her looks would be gone .	She would be reduced to having sex with bums for beer and cigarettes .	and
3	75969	He 'd pull some trick on me .	I asked him to set it .	if
2	87777	`` anyway , dropped emmy 's off with her , so i 'll go catch up when we finish our little lunch date . '' .	She was on the phone when i came in .	but
0	56332	But no one had any doubts to the truth of what dagmar had written .	Sigmar knew both his daughter and daughter-in-law well enough to know that if he searched for proof , he 'd find more than enough of it .	and
0	10934	He did mention urithiru .	Seemed to have come to the same conclusion as jasnah-that the ancient city of stormseat would have contained a path to urithiru .	and
0	79404	Supplies dwindle , become animals .	More give into despair .	and
3	26839	`` , i 'm out . '' .	You say my punishment for this one is herpes .	if
0	92405	She held up her arms .	Watched her body materialize into a vibrant green color .	and
2	152617	He then pushed his way past the first few people and nothing struck him as strange or unusual .	Made his way toward the front , looking around as he went .	but
2	28754	For john 's great weight they would have done .	At times they almost tumbled to the floor and .	but
0	29632	I lowered the box .	Gently handed it to her .	and
2	108839	They were attached to a bald , pink head , which still held those glowing green eyes .	There was no nose .	but
2	2257	A part of her was screaming for her to run , to escape , to save herself .	She did not relent .	but
2	137431	I have no desire to conjure up the memories that brought me to this point .	At least , for the moment , ill let the lukewarm water , which is mostly a trickle , and the scented soap flow over and around me .	but
0	53263	In a quiet room , which once had been full of laughter , habala sat down upon the empty bed .	Opened up a book entitled legends of arria , from which she read .	and
0	65604	She was thrusting aside the inane sensation .	Concentrating on more important matters .	and
2	103664	I scanned my companions in the hope that they might introduce me to this eccentric guest .	They were deep in conversation .	but
0	3870	She kept on crying .	When she found out she couldnt stop , she grabbed the phone and dialled joe 's number .	and
4	44156	She was just about to head .	There was a quiet knock at her bedroom door .	when
4	20379	The circle broke , and the demon made his escape .	I made my presence known .	when
2	32145	She first had the idea of having liadan erase jane 's knowledge of her gift .	Decided that not only would it not solve the problem , it was also manipulative .	but
0	88571	Where in seattle he lived , what he did for fun .	Did he always want to be a filmmaker .	and
2	124861	We 'd been out partying - nothing crazy .	We 'd had a few drinks .	but
4	72864	I 'd been excited .	It had first started snowing in early december .	when
3	52458	To give her some time to visit the store .	That was what she wanted .	if
2	147784	How much time passed .	Eventually the limo stopped and the door opened .	but
3	72566	This was a real bucket of trouble .	There ever was one .	if
1	140537	Now charles was having a hard time navigating the landmine of f-bombs .	Mostly they were emphasizing jonass rage .	because
2	109549	We let everything hang out , usually talking way too fast for the other person to even hear every word we say .	It works , every time .	but
4	136795	You/he/she was her turn to dry the body of jasmine , massaging him/it .	The friend gave her the towel .	when
0	49380	The king returned to the sofa , indeed it wouldand has i might add .	Placed his glass on the small and very old looking table in front of them .	and
0	86642	Yonfi , feeling potentially upstaged , stood on the tips of his toes .	Said , i am lord yonfi kobold , though many call me royen the eternal , for i am an immortal hero who can raise the dead .	and
2	127746	She fought to be free .	Was held in place .	but
0	63574	I was lying on the examining table .	Butters , complete with his surgical gown and his tray of autopsy instruments , stood over me .	and
0	90236	Alexei was taking his father home to russia to bury him .	Oliver was going with him .	and
0	39799	They shone blue in the night .	Were as tall as buildings .	and
2	7126	She may have only ever made a few friends in her time .	They were good people who believed in her , and not everyone was able to say that .	but
3	139916	Sound intelligent , about non-representational photography and wonders .	Perhaps she might watch him work .	if
3	141264	She could not tell .	The reason was excitement or fear .	if
2	38834	She might have rubbed me the wrong way when we met .	She was nice enough to put us up for free and all .	but
4	110901	`` , you saw what it did to him . '' .	Trace almost lost skye .	when
2	127868	My hands are tied behind my .	My legs are free .	but
3	74119	Do you know what daisy would do . '' .	You ever cheated on her .	if
0	1094	Burnett wants to tell the fru . '' .	Holiday thinks that will give them more reason to take me in for tests .	and
2	159968	Then there had been the trauma of the divorce , most of it slipped by him unnoticed .	He remembered his mother crying a lot and his auntie mary talking in whispers which petered out whenever he entered the room .	but
2	71325	He would be fully healed by morning .	He had the interim to get through .	but
4	120284	I let go of my stone magic , walked over to the dwarf , and dropped to a knee beside him .	I was sure that everyone had lowered their guns and no one was going to turn their weapons in my direction .	when
0	136786	Blood pooled in rubies on its chest .	Stained its white wing feathers crimson .	and
0	153829	Grabbing the sheets in her fists .	Staring at him with wide eyes , panting .	and
0	18583	The top of their chopper can suddenly come off cut their head open .	Trees can accidentally fall on 'em , or . ' .	and
3	126607	I mean would you pick something so prone to discovery .	You were sort of an expert when it came to this stuff .	if
0	145983	The secret panel tore from its hinges .	Flew through the air , windmilling until it smacked into brint .	and
1	94190	No matter how hard she tried to get closer to him , their relationship never improved .	Carly stood between them .	because
2	39441	Gwenna tried to move out of his grip .	He held on tighter .	but
0	112623	I protected her . '' .	Kept my hands to myself .	and
4	120898	I 'm curling into a ball , panting through the terrible stabbing in my ribs `` son of a bitch ! '' .	He yells out the broken window .	when
1	25341	He needed the sleep .	His body was exhausted .	because
0	52142	Voak blocked one of the better-aimed strikes .	Forced both blades out to the side .	and
4	49958	He would catch her off guard and strike .	She was at her most vulnerable .	when
2	105505	I know that they think i tried to escape from the hospital .	I had to go to the funeral .	but
2	81215	Cole had suspected telepathy in their ritual for some time .	The subject had never seemed relevant when he had had opportunities to talk with sadie about it .	but
2	97643	Death awaited her at the end of this trip .	What fate would befall brina and the beladors if evalle failed to return with the escaped alterants .	but
2	46583	They had probably heard the whole thing with their supernatural ears .	I was still grateful for the illusion of privacy they had given me .	but
0	19528	Just wayne and his quartermaster had traveled down in the ships gig .	Now they were watching as the last lighter departed with it 's cargo .	and
3	134122	You 'd know they were in the kitchen , laughing and eating ice cream .	You could see the two who went before you .	if
4	117250	What he 'd said to her .	He visited ruth 's house the day .	when
1	134821	I can tell you .	We all think what you are doing is absolutely great .	because
3	469	Zane wondered , all stick up his ass , when he 'd met ty .	He 'd looked like that .	if
4	17376	He made a choked sound , then bit off some french command to the driver .	I bucked to my fingers .	when
2	66404	She had prepared a whole speech that she was going to say to him .	Now she only stared at him .	but
2	5433	He wasnt the marriage type .	Two years ago he married some two-bit stripper and you wanted to die of jealousy .	but
2	1907	I grabbed the piece of candy off the table and it was gone .	Popped it into my mouth , lemon flavor bursting on my tongue , savoring the sugary sweetness .	but
4	36395	And , you become the slave of the technology ; and indirectly , the companies that have a vested interest in making sure you become sucked well and truly in and brainwashed to their way of thinking .	That happens , rather than the technology being a useful tool to help you .	when
2	5392	`` that 's true .	That 's not the reason .	but
0	122718	I felt the bones in my shins throbbing , my elbows burned .	My throat felt raw from where the kelp squeezed me .	and
4	95254	Rose reached up into the closet again , this time coming down with a small jewelry box .	She took it and glanced down into it .	when
1	94489	( i know this by heart , as the words on the page curl and blacken and smoke into nothing .	All the smokers like to tear this page out of the handbook and burn it at the lounge , sometimes crouching and sticking their cigarettes in the flames to catch a light .	because
0	30924	Tuck and i tossed the football around until joey got home .	Then he joined in .	and
4	150252	To trudge the forest out .	I can be in this dump .	when
0	12567	They were deathly sick , were aware they might die .	Could not hold food .	and
4	151255	Damn indent on the left side of his mouth deepened .	He laughed and i itched to press my finger against it .	when
4	57446	He tried to drag himself from the bed and ended up injuring four guards .	He slammed his fist down bringing a wall on them .	when
0	87169	The clock continued its uninterrupted march towards midnight .	People began to count down with thirty seconds to go .	and
3	23756	When people started asking me about it .	I was him , if it was me , i was this close to reneging on the deal and embracing my dodgerness again , once and for all .	if
2	86111	Maya nodded and caleb put a hand on her shoulder and shook his head .	Started to get to her feet .	but
0	5161	Where the fires burned .	Where they left off .	and
2	127839	You must excuse me for being a little tense , and what with the war ... oh , i shouldnt worry about the war , sir .	I have a daughter getting married next week .	but
0	87870	Wives occasionally came with their husbands .	Were beyond consolable after their men bounded off into destiny and died in the process .	and
0	109910	This trip was about him jenny , and he would honor that , no matter what .	Maybe someday he would even regret being faithful to a woman who was now only a memory , but .	and
4	102503	He had support from everyone .	The older indunas were executed one by one .	when
0	612	We too , had begun exploring the stars .	Had battled with some of the races we had encountered .	and
3	75840	I 'll go see my doctor .	I start to hurt .	if
4	97222	Yet the first panicked thought that had raced through my mind was that i would be .	Sonya had suggested i back off from nina .	when
0	99499	`` old enough to have a room to himself , '' corent had smiled at redbird .	Took toff to select the trees to cut for the wood .	and
2	111799	The task is too large for me , i fear ... not for lord janos here , who commanded the gold cloaks of king 's landing for many years .	My wound still troubles me , and .	but
3	75083	Youre here , but make no mistake they will be in line behind youand either of them is a much more suitable match for him in the eyes of the anti-prussian movement at court .	You are found unsuitable for marriage to peter .	if
0	95600	I might lose my job as sheriff .	End up living on the street begging for food .	and
2	65851	The picture was fake , of course , her favorite tv actor and most definitely human .	Someone skilled in photoshop techniques had managed to make it look as if she lay in bed with the male lead of the force .	but
4	153741	However close they are .	You jump thats how close theyll be at the other end , if not closer .	when
0	144598	Skyler felt her body melting around his .	She cried his name , gripping his shoulders as the tension coiled so tight the edges of mind began to blur , to go dark .	and
1	135420	It was a promise she regretted as soon as she made it .	She did not have the faintest idea how she was going to proceed .	because
2	24657	The shirt had seemed large .	Having jesse look at me that way made me feel all kinds of exposed .	but
0	145238	By the time i am done taunting him he will be half-crazed .	Then i will make my move .	and
2	59543	So her legs still rested across his lap .	She was sitting up .	but
0	76277	But before nakada could pull the sword from audrey , audrey jerked her blade .	The whip flew from nakadas hand , landing near me .	and
3	33426	`` oh ... '' `` underneath ! '' .	We 've lost them .	if
0	36329	But only a starving man would steal a fish or a loaf of bread .	Frankly , i wouldnt normally see that kind of theft as a terrible problem .	and
4	101531	Who would phone her friends and discuss the mystery in hushed but excitable tones , did not reply to this , as she had not replied to anything maeve had said to her .	She was not performing this function .	when
0	1195	Kira disabled the trap .	Found a second not four yards .	and
2	118830	Amira might one day tell him .	That is her decision .	but
2	15268	I could hear the voice snickering and murmuring and i quickly regained my poise .	Then he cried out , startling me , positively screaming in my head , exploding all rational thought .	but
2	63071	Amused , shawn picked it back up to toss .	The priest raised his arm and uttered , keep it .	but
0	26441	The beaters in the area suddenly became more alert .	Some of them moved to different positions .	and
4	8254	My suspicions were confirmed .	I went to the view from right outside my front door .	when
1	93472	I 'm only friends with you .	I want to use you .	because
2	127336	It was my fault as much as it was hers .	I had tried on several occasions to talk some sense into her .	but
4	51666	It means that something important is happening .	Your coach pays a house visit .	when
3	97259	Katherine , i 'd never let you out of your room .	You were my daughter .	if
1	110951	To give you something .	... '' i paused .	because
0	16553	Mr. versteeg pried open his son 's eyelids .	Felt his neck for a pulse .	and
1	121185	The parents needed was a meltdown .	One got red and the other did n't . .	because
4	160198	Matt came over to liam and his friends .	All the excitement of the competition was .	when
2	103593	Chris told her to stop .	Paiges feeling of revenge was too satisfying .	but
1	93107	They were alone , all alone in the world , - very sad .	His son 's mother had died in childbirth .	because
0	51229	She went briefly into the adjoining room .	Returned with a rolled parchment .	and
0	72673	The dripping noise had stopped .	The air around him seemed to be static .	and
2	155529	It may actually be masking a second layer that the person has become very skilled at hiding .	Our most primitive animal instincts can detect .	but
0	153355	He only wants a word with you .	To give you something .	and
0	61801	No way would he try .	Keep something like this a secret .	and
0	14857	It was running out .	Spooling to the end .	and
0	75493	He opened the door to the connecting room .	Found his prey waiting .	and
2	121111	I was only fifteen .	No one could have beaten me that day .	but
0	83633	Not a person was to be seen in the streets .	They proceeded directly to the front of the church , where the minor canon pointed out the stone griffin .	and
0	155061	That was a pretty good apology .	I was glad he 'd spoken .	and
4	24754	Why would you want to bond with another person 's energy .	You have your own .	when
2	74487	Cara 's tone was light .	Her features were dark , as if a storm cloud covered them .	but
2	84158	The howling of the wolves was short .	There was no cry from the man , and .	but
0	97440	He walked to a nearby table , and then handed it to jason .	Poured water into a goblet .	and
3	78804	Imagine how i 'll feel when i get it .	I can feel this good staying upright just a few seconds .	if
2	129378	Keith dropped the letters he 'd been holding .	He kept his eyes averted while he pulled on his overcoat and closed his briefcase .	but
2	64789	Slowly ( he could have gone much faster .	It was just as well that annie should not know that ) over to the bed .	but
2	85384	That little square bedroom in the ward may be where i sleep every night .	It is not my home .	but
3	10570	How can i get into a good college .	My application looks like oh .	if
2	147914	Kiethara , disgusted with herself , looked up at last with an apology etched all over her face .	She was too late .	but
4	147377	I place it in the oven and look up to see candace walking in , wearing a pair of my boxers and a t-shirt .	I take the last heated tortilla from one of the skillets .	when
4	153166	Everything will be ready for you .	They discharge you in the morning .	when
0	116598	Most of the seatons heavy guns would be on the plains below , only a few seaton tanks could negotiate the mountains .	They were all light tanks .	and
4	36931	I always got a craving for french fries .	The air conditioning came on .	when
4	38107	But the cancer came back hard and she was gone within a few months .	We were in high school .	when
2	101146	There 's another north of phoenix that goes to the willow land .	They 'd have to ride around the city .	but
4	137233	How long had she dreamed of the day .	The man she loved would tell her he felt the same .	when
2	155002	Rachel had been enjoying the spectacle of grant sullivan driven to frustration by his pretty , darkeyed wife .	Now she felt almost sorry for him .	but
2	158110	She was inside the plane .	She could see the lights in the hangar from the small windows .	but
4	108444	She could get impossible amounts of water on the floor .	She did the dishes .	when
2	135457	Maybe a few had survived ; this was a full military operation .	This was not just a small colony .	but
4	148277	What linus had done .	I 'd been on trial for vivian 's crimes .	when
0	124879	My mothers mood would darken on a dime .	To this day , it still borders on the manic .	and
0	30818	It lurched slowly round a corner .	Was lost to view .	and
4	3398	They could feel free .	The hal-jafar let them run free , when there were no laws and no gods to look down on them .	when
2	101839	That sounded like an interesting story .	It seemed best to just shut up at this point , no sense rising to the bait .	but
0	130085	But time passes , so i started to visit madame doparis establishment from time to time .	Although i could never have put anyone else in the place of my dearest fenissa , i felt the need of female company on occasion .	and
0	149081	Because of what adarian did , i am ... unless the creature holding his powers is utterly destroyed . '' .	Will forever be enslaved .	and
4	41551	How the freaks must feel .	They were out and about in the world .	when
2	16548	Alea wanted nothing more than to throw herself into those strong arms and hold him .	They had to hit the water and swim for land .	but
3	52585	You can look for another one . '' .	You hate your job with roger .	if
2	148022	He had blood all over his shoulder .	Once he unbuttoned his shirt and felt around in there , he knew that the blood was jessie 's .	but
0	30627	Maggie reached the top of the staircase .	Trudged down a dim corridor .	and
3	81360	Rip her hair out , or throttle the obtuse girl .	She wanted to scream in frustration .	if
3	36356	They would still be .	No one had come searching for those soldiers .	if
2	5352	He wanted to look in her eyes .	It was hard when they were this close .	but
4	21286	`` but she spoke ? '' .	She was lying on the couch .	when
3	8912	He needed his head examined .	He was beginning to think there could be anything else between us .	if
2	110571	They made a quick search of the interior .	Other than the four of them , the brewery appeared empty of people .	but
2	17779	And then of course having a newborn doesnt usually make for the most stable employee i knew all of that .	I guess i just needed to hear someone say it out .	but
3	92684	Get inside the father , understand the father .	Only she could see the father .	if
2	51284	I go to lift it up .	I notice the outline of a bruise on my arm .	but
0	49873	She 's better equipped for a mental battle .	She knows how to fight me off .	and
4	75435	She felt a great sense of accomplishment .	The first strand broke .	when
3	118120	You 'll vote marla ? '' .	We put up marla and jendan .	if
4	1539	The only time kendra was out of her sight on the day in question was .	Rex brought kendra into his office for a minute or two to respond to a call from a parent .	when
4	128036	An anxious smile tugged at my mouth .	The blue van pulled into the school parking lot .	when
1	13094	He had a right to take her , severance decided .	She belonged to him .	because
4	50127	That bullet was too close to your heart , i was .	They said it was merely a few centimeters away from killing you .	when
2	142349	Risa has no idea what he 's going to say .	She finds she 's actually curious .	but
0	47805	She pulled back slightly but he found her eyes no longer angry .	Looked up at him .	and
2	11824	It 's kind of .	This band is really good .	but
0	147779	She put the book back into its envelope .	Returned to her speech .	and
2	94921	His laughter died ? '' .	His arms stayed tight when he called , `` faye .	but
2	117394	It had been white .	Most of the paint had flaked off exposing rust .	but
0	18339	She 'd been reading .	Put it on his nightstand .	and
3	32894	Trust me i 'm positively thrilled it 's sophie mercer .	Archer had to be stuck in the basement with any girl at this school .	if
0	72780	Fergus leads your clan .	Not you is because he 's a ruthless bastard .	and
4	115907	He lived like that .	Especially he made it sound as if he had been as busy and well off as mark .	when
4	107527	My brain flashed back to biology class three years .	We had typed our own blood .	when
2	72216	I should really have had a sherpa guide , and all was not lost .	Now i was expected to navigate the show .	but
0	93575	Only does what she absolutely has to do .	Now has a fifty million-credit price tag on her head .	and
0	59893	Who separated evil from good .	Placed it into a vessel that would contain it .	and
4	63587	He had the goofiest grin on his face .	I got close enough to see .	when
4	126216	Keeping a secret is very hard .	Especially keeping it is against our own principles .	when
2	133737	`` yes , i will see you soon , '' said dulcet .	Her eyes filled with tears .	but
4	40200	And we both dissolved into laughter .	I mentioned i 'd also wear my pearl necklace .	when
2	70127	`` i 've had word of him , '' mika added , and .	All ears pricked up at that .	but
4	139929	But brinker was only nineteen .	He ended up in sara 's fireplace .	when
0	59258	To supervise warriors , protectors , and other magical people in my territory .	To report demon and hunter activity to our central headquarters .	and
3	39521	He would kill these bastards .	They 'd laid a finger on jane or her children .	if
2	17360	We got separated in nikkoi , and .	That was when i was taken by a group who figured me a slave .	but
2	64444	I wanted to ask before i sent her ahead to texas . '' .	Just so you know , you 'll be driving there with me .	but
0	56085	He shook the sleepiness from his head .	Made his way toward the door .	and
2	59639	Carvelle hurriedly began the creation of a second more powerful equinox project .	There were so few who would survive such an intense alteration .	but
0	116061	They took a sharp slant .	His eyes filled with ice .	and
3	72461	My husband did very much fear censure .	He showed mercy to you or your unfortunate colleagues .	if
0	55227	He was now forced to look at me , then sat back and smiled knowingly at him .	I leaned forward and kissed his mouth .	and
0	25344	I know the manner of your upbringing .	Why you claim to be a match for any man .	and
3	37530	Truly loved him-would i hesitate .	I loved him-if i .	if
3	126945	I have no choices .	Especially i want to live here , which i do .	if
0	31383	Yes , she is of good comfort .	I enjoy her company .	and
4	19539	To gouge my eyeballs out .	I made the mistake of looking at the ass-end of one of them when they were bending over .	when
2	142327	`` crazy , '' he grumbled to kaladin .	Easily lifted the wounded bridgeman and carried him back to the hollow .	but
2	68038	Might not fit all the data .	This looks a lot like a mission : repopulation to me .	but
4	41985	But , i didnt hear the hatred i had feared might be .	She just spoke my name .	when
4	140346	She was as childlike and innocent as malphas had warned them .	It came to human emotions .	when
2	31661	The gusts had finally abated in the late afternoon .	The weather was still bitter , even for january , and a snowfall-the first thomas could remember in over a decade-blanketed his yard and fields in a wintry mantel .	but
0	36886	I dropped my backpack on the ground .	Sunk down to my knees .	and
4	151173	Few wore a smile , because they had either lost something or were reminded of what they missed .	They hung up the phone .	when
2	103355	The question was rhetorical .	Johan didnt take it that way .	but
0	51162	`` before he left , he raided the prison 's infirmary . '' .	Stole all of the potions in their stockroom .	and
3	146744	Theo would never have brought you anywhere near triad .	He 'd realized conley 's real agenda .	if
0	89842	Cleo went to the man .	Put her hands on him .	and
2	154703	There had been one phone call .	No-one spoke when he answered .	but
2	113460	Not only was everything written in vietnamese .	There were no numbers next to the entrees .	but
3	34667	I was saying skim .	You let me finish .	if
2	147870	I might not be a great fighter .	I can turn the tide of this battle single-handed .	but
2	11590	Once again she tried to say something .	It was muffled against his questing mouth .	but
1	142047	She liked to complain from time to time .	It was her right and privilege .	because
4	132048	Isolated incidents disrupt peace .	So much is at stake .	when
0	71696	Tears fell as i reached to close his eyes .	I felt liam 's hand on my back .	and
1	159248	Cowboy stepped back and threw from a full windup .	He was a large teenager with no visible handicaps .	because
4	63638	It took only a little arguing to force the issue .	The k-mar van showed up .	when
0	151532	She put pepper down , disappearing inside as an emptiness settled over me that i couldnt quite get past .	Opened the door to her house .	and
2	36446	Worked on my inventions didnt tell her because i wanted to surprise her like she had surprised me with the chocolate .	I slipped into the hold every day and .	but
4	28508	He pushed her away with a little more force than he had intended .	She hung on one-handed ( her nails now biting into the nape of his neck ) and tried to thrust her hips against him .	when
2	140886	I looked nervously at aiden .	He was staring down at the table , still rubbing his bicep .	but
2	44942	There was a bigger conference room on the first floor .	We had to ask the lawyers real nicely if we could use it .	but
0	3006	Without change , nothing happened .	If nothing happened , then nothing would exist .	and
3	153921	Now , nobody would believe me .	Even i were to find the heart of their organization .	if
4	75594	I was going to be at their apartment .	She got back with larissa .	when
4	43305	That caught me around the waist .	The cat 's tails snaked around and stung my belly .	when
4	64657	She wondered , maybe many years .	Alice could have drawn this sketch .	when
3	141989	You still kissed him .	I caught the drift of what you were saying .	if
0	16438	But this is the internet age .	People dont believe anything without pictures and videos .	and
0	14215	The earl bowed slightly , as he would a man .	Then shook madame lefoux 's hand .	and
0	139915	He reached onto his dashboard .	Grabbed a pack of marlboros .	and
0	130806	I drew circles on her table .	You are angry because i told you what they say .	and
2	55311	It was lovely , of course . '' .	It 's the fifth squirrel i 've made this year .	but
4	124325	Rummaging through my bag .	I 'm startled by hands creeping around my waist and warm breath on the back of my neck .	when
0	86845	Now , will someone please explain why you two seem so familiar ? '' .	Why gwen felt the need to lie about being a spy in order to save you , hunter .	and
0	144428	I was able to gracefully dismiss her company .	Was contented with pursuing me own tasks , and me own thoughts .	and
2	28740	I 'd tell you to complete the breh-hedden .	I already know you 're both stubborn enough to fight me to the death over that one .	but
3	142770	Will always be , and i do not suppose i will .	Even i should ever marry .	if
2	46465	He turned to look at her .	She chose not make eye contact .	but
1	38025	`` , so how would you be able to buy lunch ? '' .	Maybe you 're not making any money .	because
3	112910	The company did exists .	Even the proprietor was in the habit of sleeping at the premises .	if
3	56206	But , you can sort of overlook it without feelin so bad .	Ya dont see him and he dont actually talk to ya .	if
2	148509	At first it was so lozan could help tyhreb heal .	Lozan was also able to teach tyhreb how to communicate .	but
1	31254	When youre done teaching me .	Ill be able to kick your butt .	because
2	37852	He knew he would probably have a chance to turn the tables on lausaux in the hour or so before dawn .	Could he force him to talk .	but
2	135539	Frazier said he thought it was bullshit when al-qassim told him some of the artists he wanted to sell . '' .	They seem to line up with what you guys said you had .	but
1	130420	Maybe he is so cold .	That is part of his image .	because
4	71784	Over the last two weeks he 'd found that the need to have bairns was dimmed .	He 'd realized how many things he wanted to do with her .	when
2	55425	I need to see my husband , i will call the governor if i need to .	My daughter is dying and her father needs to come with me to see her , to hold her one last time and say goodbye .	but
2	76023	In the picture eric had given me today , he was in somewhat the same pose .	He was holding a hand out to the camera as if he was inviting the viewer to come join him on the bed .	but
0	47485	3 tired as he was , reuben was game for a trip to the cellars .	Followed felix willingly down the steps .	and
0	17632	He sat , his big white hand covering both of mine , still folded neatly in my lap .	Leaned over to me .	and
2	53816	He looked sickly guilty , too , and .	She knew he was thinking , just as she was , of eve .	but
0	42382	He pulled himself up with his arms .	Swung his legs high to wrap them around the ladder .	and
2	160442	He trusted kelly with his life in most situations .	Driving in boston was apparently not one of those situations because he would sooner f**k a rhinoceros than do that .	but
4	55774	For a split second i think maybe my worst fears have come true and i 'm actually burning in hell , because shit .	My fingers meet my eyes .	when
3	130053	And , then i 'll gladly take the opportunity .	I can tell scott to f**k off at four in the morning .	if
1	12327	Then you must be a cat , jane said .	I cant even see my hand in front of my face .	because
2	58340	There was some discussion of space elevators for mars and earth .	Nothing solid had come of it .	but
0	45644	Then thorolf took himself off .	Was in the worst of minds .	and
2	150832	Today i woke up and .	Saw a glimmer of sun breaking in from under the cloud i 've carried around with me for the past year .	but
0	48771	The public library was open on sunday afternoons from one until six .	On the day after dorrance 's visit , ralph went down there , mostly because he had nothing better to do .	and
0	98492	You fly off in a pouty princess rage .	Leave me , dagmar , and annwyl to deal with all that gods-damn brotherly whining that followed .	and
4	65890	It met nothing but thin air .	His left foot came .	when
0	75023	`` next time , i want light . '' .	I think i 'm highly offended that you just called this work .	and
4	150620	He was hot and fevered , and his sheets were wet .	He woke from the dream .	when
2	77956	He asked a few questions .	I shut the conversation out , wondering where jim was .	but
2	153891	It has been filed in the d.c. federal court from which he was sentenced for cocaine distribution .	Quinn is still in jail in roanoke .	but
2	38717	I lost my phone in the fire .	Im sure well see other .	but
0	29139	To have more time with him .	Be able to steer him away from that type of magic .	and
3	38810	I might see exactly that .	I went and looked at old security tapes .	if
0	139600	She looked thin and wan but she was smiling tiredly , almost valiantly , at the camera .	Had a rug thrown around her legs .	and
3	126926	He would have to care for her himself .	He wanted her alive , which there was no doubt he did .	if
4	159859	`` why did you try to kill him ? '' .	He was an infant .	when
3	146684	She 'd have pushed him .	He 'd shown even an ounce of pity .	if
2	36910	The three-bedroom townhouse was cozy trendy .	Decorated in earthy tuscan tones .	but
0	129799	Colby switched on the flashlight he had slung on his belt .	Led the way several feet into the cavern .	and
0	149165	I shoved kenzie behind me .	Met the first two that flapped toward us , pale fingers reaching for my face .	and
0	139157	She trembled from the effort , sweat dripping down her face as she reached into the mists .	Wrapped her arms around the baby .	and
4	108142	Lacey 's father had been a real piece of work .	He was alive , heavy with the strap when his kids disappointed him .	when
3	124425	You 'd both know it . '' .	I wanted to push him .	if
2	2327	We need to ensure that the army is protected .	We do not over commit .	but
2	144505	There were no prints on the weapon . '' .	It was registered to the witness .	but
2	3063	The misinformation was not only to keep the soviets off guard .	Also to keep the surviving romanovs in line .	but
3	4980	This would be my pick . '' .	You want me to guess which source you should rely on .	if
0	121561	Playing a japanese imitation telecaster ; '' the lyrics going something like this .	Doing a song called `` six-pack mama .	and
0	23613	Nolan hung back on the steps until most of the class was gone .	He thought about his choices .	and
0	78200	The crowd was heavy .	We stuck close together as we made our way down the middle of the street .	and
3	132956	Dagger would much rather find himself in front of a group of well-armed tankars , than one disarmed gorgor .	Even they were only savage beasts guided by bestial instincts .	if
2	42143	I beg the rabbi to forgive me .	It was not the phoenicians .	but
4	47152	That was old to me .	Your grandmother was young .	when
3	46970	You might not want me to bleed on you .	You have a cut .	if
2	117792	She 's actually overqualified for the job . '' .	I think she wants to stay in town .	but
3	38578	I need to stay strong for my mom .	I did , id spiral into a well of depression and i cant afford to do that .	if
2	112901	She tries to hide it when she catches sight of me .	It 's too late , i 've seen it .	but
2	44865	A good number of them are true , she said , smiling .	Then her voice sobered .	but
0	101436	I stared at her .	She peered up at me , her eyes going wide at the look on my face .	and
2	54711	In the end , some continued toward charlottesville .	Most attempted to hold their ground against a heavily armed force that did not hesitate , but opened fire as one as soon as they were in range .	but
3	119130	The least she could have done is let me know .	She was going to ditch her christmas eve shift and make me take it when i requested it off a month .	if
2	57267	I knew the date was going to be awful , you know how setups go .	I had no idea i would have such a good time tonight .	but
2	62061	I had seen high school scuffles , of course , had even been in a few .	I was looking at the results of a serious beating for the first time in my life .	but
0	10216	We stop pestering those church soldiers .	Let them finish their ramp .	and
2	12022	Bax plucked up his carpetbag .	As matthew reached for his own , bax stopped him .	but
2	140099	It confirmed the reality of vampire ghosts in general .	Denied their existence in any specific , here-and-now sense .	but
4	108297	To go past some particularly malevolent people .	They blocked his path .	when
2	6207	Expense money was hard to come by sometimes , the marshal had explained .	He must have figured this was a harsh place for a deputy federal marshal without any money in his pocket for expenses .	but
2	106921	Link tried to get his attention .	Panch appeared to have lapsed back into unconsciousness .	but
1	105775	This is a joke we 've had with ally for years .	Her dad works in the music industry .	because
0	91671	They reached the fire .	They all started taking seats around it , perching on old trunks of dark tress , a typical campfire setting .	and
0	153713	Well , ill tell her that you folded like a weak hand then slinked .	Played right into my plan .	and
2	106367	I 'd rather stay with you . '' .	I 'd feel like a traitor if i did .	but
3	145339	We would have been the laughingstock of the school .	We really fell for each other .	if
4	108452	He was so smart .	Hed put his shirt on backwards that morning .	when
2	35092	True , the brouhaha two years ago had been a near disaster .	Things had settled down after gwen frazier left town .	but
0	45775	Ernest said he would guide her to the interstate .	He eventually did , but not before passing by his favorite all night donut shop .	and
3	89983	That would be far sooner , not both brothers if he were to move on his father 's throne .	He only needed to await the death of atticus .	if
0	69538	Hamish shouldered his sten-gun and eloise followed .	Hurried back down the steps .	and
2	70139	It was over in a moment .	The shudder went on for a lot longer .	but
2	1467	`` it 's nice meeting you . '' .	I have to run .	but
0	95111	He 'd caught me , of course .	Was now watching me with a pale , alarmed expression .	and
0	153634	One ship had been touched by the discharge .	Was wandering in an erratic manner .	and
2	53114	It took a few telephone transfers to get to the person who knew anything about it .	Apparently there was a decent offer on the victorian on baltimore street .	but
2	98484	To offer you a job for .	If i tried , well , you know riders can be a dick .	but
0	14488	Luke filled her mothers gas tank .	With a quick peck on her cheek , left arianna with her mother .	and
4	113827	What happened to guys like him .	They went off half-cocked and did something ( gasp .	when
0	29959	Mr. gray had come looking for a magical parcel .	When he 'd failed to deliver it to his employer colin greenmantle , greenmantle had flooded the town with people looking for mr. gray .	and
2	57840	He fell back from the force of the blow .	The one with the crossbow in its chest continued to claw and swipe at her .	but
1	68237	The door was hanging open .	The box was completely stuffed with mail .	because
4	13700	Give me a call at the clinic .	You have a chance .	when
2	34946	Doma certainly loved him and could this love be ended in marriage or they too would have to live in lifelong loneliness like rita .	He too loved her .	but
3	57891	They might have carried the entire hospital with them .	It had been one of singing and celebration .	if
3	80837	Why should it matter to me ? '' .	You see mr. green or .	if
4	102889	Then my scanning slowed .	I caught words like pregnancy termination and balance due .	when
3	93883	It might be better . '' .	We could just avoid each other .	if
2	152863	You could go . '' .	We 'd still feel the same way .	but
0	104579	I leaned forward on my elbows .	Held my head in my hands trying to regain equilibrium .	and
0	38685	She sighed , starting the swing swaying back and .	Pushed against the ground out of habit .	and
1	80824	Even quinn and zander were sporting glowing red-faces .	They understood what she was asking for .	because
3	40123	To thicken up your blood .	Youre going to survive the winter .	if
0	59225	Cramming his former years of education .	Whatever else there was to learn into his cranium ten hours a day .	and
4	143533	How did he look so perfectly sexy and inviting .	She was disheveled and looking pretty much like a beached whale .	when
2	45364	He was tough on me .	He was a decent , fair man .	but
1	12579	She 'd gotten them all secondhand .	They were embossed with someone else 's initials .	because
3	159397	It will decrease your chances that you 'll find a way around my demon and get it yourself . '' .	The word gets out i 've got it .	if
2	47755	My arms were still wrapped around my chest .	He wrapped his arms around mine and held me tight .	but
0	156115	He plunged winter kiss into one moving piece .	A tentacle came swinging out of the mass and smashed into him , tossing him back to bounce against the wall .	and
2	156889	Yes , the knife is necessary .	Think what that knife will effect .	but
2	134545	The other guys liked the lord of the rings films .	They scorned fantasy books as something only math club members were really interested in .	but
2	109865	It 's no excuse and - '' jaxxon held a hand up , deciding to put him out of his misery .	I was absolutely smashed .	but
2	71833	He gulped , trying to banish the dirty images wreaking havoc on his brain .	It was too late .	but
3	129488	She would have lived that way and the indications are pretty strong that she had emotional issues .	She was emotionally disturbed .	if
3	33690	I have to make myself do that .	You have any idea i 'd be a help .	if
2	83872	I love you , liam , she wanted to whisper .	She kissed his hair again and rested her cheek on his head .	but
4	24729	Things eventually work out .	You make sure you 're on god 's side .	when
3	3587	Make sure you come in . '' .	You experience anything irregular .	if
0	45203	Anatolians on them are enslaved .	Ive not mustered the strength to free them because miranda denies there is a problem .	and
2	76215	The force of it staggered us .	We did not cry out , or even flinch .	but
0	10150	They left the room .	Returned through the curving passage back to the main passage .	and
2	143198	There doesnt have to be an internal problem .	It 's awfully close to a hostile program action if it 's random .	but
3	99353	It needed to know the layout and feel of the place .	The beast was going to be here from now on .	if
0	95844	He tagged his own watch for possible disruption .	Knocked at the door .	and
0	158465	I have not moved .	She barely has , but the world feels strange beneath me .	and
2	103205	It was nicer than hank deserved .	I had an ulterior motive .	but
1	33487	It took them a full five minutes to get kelly up the stairs and by the time he eased onto the edge of his bed , they were both out of breath .	Mostly they had to keep stopping to laugh at the absurdity of it .	because
0	40563	The trees and berry bushes sprouted thorns .	Wildlife made good use of claws and horns .	and
0	23964	He looked at sacnik his eyes were warm .	He said nothing , but .	and
3	57821	She 'd kill him .	She knew what he was up to .	if
0	50287	The other two felt his defeat .	Stopped what they were doing to follow .	and
0	20834	She looked for edwards .	Found him prone on the floor , unconscious .	and
2	66817	Her face is in the center .	The whole page is covered in a diagram : streets and landmarks , carefully drawn and labeled .	but
0	118642	In time his desire was achieved ; and its beauty was very great , for now the countless jewels of the nauglamir did reflect and cast abroad in marvellous hues the light of the silmaril amidmost .	The greatest of the works of elves and dwarves were brought together and made one .	and
2	60193	I thought brian might just wait for us in the waiting room , saying there would probably be bags to carry .	He insisted on helping .	but
0	121694	There is only one pass through the mountains .	It runs through the valley .	and
0	63550	I was fifteen going on sixteen .	I was enjoying a life of a young adult .	and
0	41674	Nuala looked away from me to dee .	I saw dislike burning fiercely in her eyes .	and
0	62961	Peter stomped over to the shelves .	Started straightening the already perfectly-straightened books .	and
2	77310	I am deeply disappointed .	The disappointment has given rise to an idea .	but
0	114929	A lump sprang into her throat .	She had to choke back a tear as she turned and left that child behind .	and
2	154202	When gwenna had suggested they come back later , brittany had waved her hand in dismissal of the idea , and .	Nate had said , `` your ex-husband 's .	but
4	1076	Myra noticed ian 's eyes narrow .	He arrived at the same conclusion .	when
2	77072	I will speak to whomever i need to speak to .	You need to sweep the ceiling area again , someones .	but
0	44149	My lips part the shadow swoops straight up , a black mass ready to devour me .	Then plunges straight at me .	and
0	49899	I listen to his words .	They 're hard to decipher-he 's speaking .	and
2	82898	Did she love clothes and shopping .	A girls ' day out sounded like a treat .	but
2	50113	Savannah reached out to lay a hand on his arm .	She was otherwise careful to keep her sympathy to herself , not wanting him to realize how easily she had slipped into his mind and taken his memories into her heart .	but
0	58483	Every option had put him quinn fighting viper , macha and the beladors .	Tzader had considered several possible ways to have evalle freed , but .	and
3	85168	It is simply it has been taken for granted .	He has said nothing about it .	if
2	64263	It 's too bad emily had to work this evening . '' .	It was so nice of you to bring noah .	but
3	29930	Tex grins and so does mean mike .	Kaboom had the balls .	if
2	9191	When she stood beside yoshi , brad could see the age difference between the women .	Elinor 's mother just did not look like a mother to him .	but
1	113698	Little reggie didnt utter a word .	He knew the last laugh would be his .	because
0	93403	He hit another key .	Sent an email message to the yacht captain in cancn as he watched the happy mariss faces .	and
0	117085	I wrapped my arms around his neck .	Pulled his head down toward mine .	and
2	33840	Maybe he 's a little disappointed about something .	Then he turns and walks on .	but
3	103478	You 've got ta clean up .	You want to get dirty with him .	if
2	10616	Saint tried to embrace her/it .	She removed him without opening mouth .	but
2	113888	I was still crying .	These were angry tears , pissed-off tears .	but
0	60330	Rolce didnt even know what they were .	They spent the next several minutes marveling at the convenience of it all .	and
3	76321	Bad things would happen .	The humans somehow manage to defend themselves from the assault .	if
1	112540	The families who own those smaller shops might have to move out of town .	They dont have enough money to compete with the bigger stores .	because
0	84587	Maybe they could put two and two together . '' .	Know we 'd gone through the swag .	and
2	32326	Jim started to speak .	Patrick began making darth vader heavy breathing noises .	but
0	136680	Where he fell to one knee .	Slammed his shardblade into the ground .	and
2	89234	* * * amy would have gone to the marquee and she feared breaking her promise to do some study every day .	Would have loved to see the used wonz .	but
4	39147	I was about to speak .	There was a knock at the door .	when
0	103685	I pictured little jannalynn playing on it .	Found myself picturing a swing hitting her in the head .	and
0	10482	I fumbled for his gun , found it .	Whipped the weapon up .	and
0	117110	Pulling me close , his arms wrapped around my waist .	He buried his face in my curls .	and
3	96566	Who i was , would you think commoner or mystical .	None of you had met me ? '' .	if
2	38184	The top of the altar had once been one stone slab .	Was now split in two near the middle of the stone .	but
0	59298	I might indulge myself .	Stay a day or two .	and
0	6775	To track this person .	Figure out what he or she was really up to in ashland .	and
0	58748	From the two master weavers , she drew out twelve semitones , a full scale .	Filled her spools with the harmonic threads of life .	and
0	11225	Hugh 's report implied lucinda had been killed last night , according to doug .	This note had been slipped to me .	and
0	26943	He knew a lot of the other losers and stew bums in town .	They told him what jessie did out .	and
0	135729	She turned back to him .	Tucked her hands in-in the event they acted on that impulse .	and
2	158844	I can fight my own battles . '' .	That '' - i nod my head toward the ipod dock on our entertainment center - `` is definitely not one of them .	but
1	83056	She needed more of an explanation .	He continued , hey , i miss you .	because
4	150874	He approached the bare back of the french captain with sure , heavy strides , raising the thongs of the whip over his shoulder as he marched .	The boatswain was satisfied the whip was still in good working order .	when
0	117619	They traveled for a bit .	When they were outside the village hughenon talked to a few of the knights following him .	and
0	29683	Toby put his hands on her shoulders .	Looked her in the eyes .	and
0	74058	My grandfather reached out .	Patted my knee with a large callused hand .	and
0	32937	Only when they were so far away from the golden edifice he called his throne did they come out in the open .	Mingle with the population , whose general attire was not at all different from their present ones .	and
2	129962	I 'd had a white-collar upbringing for my first decade .	That my parents had descended pretty quickly through blue collar and down below , so you could say i was a medley .	but
0	90829	The breeze kicked up , and the wind lodged the newspaper at the gate and inside the protective wall of mesh , a k-99 stared at the debris then scanned the surrounding area .	Forced the debris further down the fence .	and
2	154763	Then vash , dakas , and enalla came out of the forest .	They stopped , staring in open astonishment and disbelief at eleria .	but
4	85978	Filling your head with human nonsense .	She should have been preparing you for your true destiny .	when
2	115515	James had officiated at weddings both large and small in his years of office .	This was only his second one with harry comstock at his side .	but
0	141393	Father odin 's will held me pinned to the floor .	I could no more escape it or force it away than could an insect stop a shoe from descending .	and
3	72640	I would kill you first , but he was wrong in not targeting our killing frost . '' .	I were to try and kill the princess .	if
4	31471	I 'm lying to myself .	I say i 'd rather be asexual or a lesbian or whatever other silly scheme i come up with .	when
3	145895	There 's no way breeze got away without cett letting him .	Cett really is mistborn .	if
0	29834	Owen looked up at the stranger .	His face went white with shock - as pale and stunned and bloodless as i 'd ever seen it .	and
0	58966	She soon caught up .	Slowed to match his pace .	and
0	1424	For once in your life stop running from yourself .	Have the courage to take what you want .	and
0	100074	She was wearing a sweatshirt embroidered with kittens .	The firelight turned her glasses into glowing orbs .	and
2	132047	She liked it and . '' .	I liked her and back then that was .	but
1	150732	I 'm not going to prison .	You want to talk my ear off .	because
4	38619	They sighed unanimously and collapsed like rag dolls , played out .	The synchrony of their bodies movements rose to the apex .	when
2	37702	As he walks side by side with his father , curios cant help and the rewards that will follow .	Let his mind wonder conjuring images and thoughts of what he could possibly be asked to do .	but
4	143625	He squeezed my hand .	We went into the pitch dark garage .	when
2	127134	I was more powerful than she was , and .	That meant the demon would want to jump to me .	but
2	60021	Where she arguably might pass out from lack of sleep .	Maybe she 'd land on a bed of roses .	but
3	60696	`` , perhaps she can teach others how this is accomplished . '' .	She can stand unharmed in the presence of god .	if
2	49889	Working in a casino hadnt made deenas dreams come true .	At least she didnt have to worry about a date for new years eve .	but
4	145725	Sam was fond of porridge .	Especially it was sweetened with honey .	when
3	11028	The women in his house could yammer and they did , sitting around the kitchen or on the deck furniture , lexie sipping beer , her girls sucking back cocktails and , as with the pictures , they did it for hours .	He was not dragging their asses to restaurants .	if
0	81047	Near the top , a strip was crudely carved around the post .	Was just thick enough for the rope to set in .	and
4	42130	That 's - and dangerous .	Things can get sticky .	when
2	140512	The x-rays of your spine came out clear .	You 've bruised your tailbone .	but
2	148465	It was never awful , per se .	She 'd never taken any personal pleasure from it .	but
2	77190	I tried to save her .	There was just so much blood .	but
4	121032	Sometimes the two of them stayed up and ate pop-corn and watched those movies .	He slept over at brian 's .	when
3	132259	It would be very interesting to know .	There were other unexplained fires hereabouts in the sixties .	if
2	64210	I never met the guy .	I 've heard about him .	but
3	51480	Stop and stay where you are , and let your group members reestablish contact .	You lose voice contact with the other members of your group .	if
0	50132	Ascending the central platform .	Collapsing once again on a leather couch .	and
3	40495	He would attempt to inflict upon his skinner a mortal wound .	The thurmonds decided to skin him .	if
0	115053	When the smoke cleared .	Ramose approached the blast-point .	and
3	54533	But do you mind .	I go home first and get some things .	if
2	84416	An insect crawled over her hand and it was impossible to control deep inside where something totally unknown to her-something feminine and all woman-reached for him .	She controlled the itch that ran up her skin .	but
2	144731	I got a quick kiss as she left .	I could tell she was all business .	but
0	56369	She threw her arms around him , bringing color to his face .	Began rubbing his pale cheeks .	and
0	17202	The men of brethil were worsted driven back into their woods .	Handir gave them battle , but .	and
0	9364	Valerius felt an urge to laugh .	Show the man his own set of real fangs , but refrained .	and
2	141146	Hes always been fascinated by that hollowness of eyes which others try on only as cosmetic .	Which , for him , defines her special allure .	but
3	1276	How i felt about him .	I was so offended .	if
4	67592	I nearly fell over from relief .	It swung back toward the seeker .	when
2	155663	A bright red object half-filled it , masking everything .	It was shrinking so fast that within a couple of seconds the bright white point of light that was the alien armada had reappeared and the red dot was moving off to the right .	but
2	121168	Gabriella not only slept with nick .	Actually cared about him .	but
0	91697	Paul pointed to a small silver panel just above the floor , it was apparently a touch sensitive pad .	All i had to do was touch it with my toe .	and
0	46511	He shot a smile over his shoulder .	In that very moment , an image flashed inside my head .	and
2	125504	His hair and beard were white .	Strands of black still showed about his lips and ears .	but
0	129634	Dropping to her knees , she scooped up blackbeard .	Rubbed her nose in his fur .	and
1	84931	These new cars didnt have alarms .	Alarms didnt stop anyone from stealing the car and the parts were running out .	because
4	129118	How to deal with an armed student .	You attended teacher school .	when
4	99893	She asked under her breath , `` do we really have to come to this party ? '' .	He looked down at mairi .	when
0	113935	Before i realized what i was doing , i took a pair of long steps , shifting my grip on my staff as i went .	Swung it like a golf club at the fetch 's head .	and
4	139558	The humming in my ears ceased .	Their blades no longer touched .	when
2	153734	I hear karen telling me its no time for a snack .	I dont look back and keep going .	but
2	46510	They 're being quiet .	I can hear doors opening and closing .	but
2	86402	That were no less powerful .	No longer had rhythm .	but
2	40927	His sorrow is different from sam 's , angrier , a rage caught up in an agony that 's centuries old and still red hot : a purpose .	It 's also more controlled than sam 's , less self-pitying , like he 's channeling his emotions into something .	but
1	33040	The visit from the cops and the fbi had been even louder than that .	As molly pulled the blue beetle into the little gravel parking lot , i saw her coming up the stairs from my apartment , one at a time , leaning heavily on her cane .	because
0	98117	She looks directly at tyson .	I hide a smirk .	and
4	85218	Garion restrained zakath with one hand .	The mallorean emperor 's face grew outraged .	when
0	41078	With a curse and loud whistle , he thrust his hands into his pockets and into the large townhouse .	Marched up the stairs .	and
0	123525	Nassar climbed up next to her hoisted her up into the seven foot wide basin .	Grabbed her by her waist .	and
2	135763	I dont know how many credits he spent on charisma or leadership traits .	He has them in abundance .	but
1	56462	But now i knowi messed it all up .	I allowed you to think i didnt care .	because
0	115217	Got up without asking for further explanation .	Alexei , to my surprise , followed him without any questions .	and
2	92070	Clearly i knew that inviting the woman and her kids meant dad was serious .	Hearing her kids say it brought the point home .	but
2	95063	He was a member of ravage .	He preferred to play with a woman in private .	but
0	49291	No , the title of king had belonged to his father .	Should now be nolan 's .	and
4	94472	What the hell was i thinking .	I let this man just tuck me into bed and leave .	when
4	48550	`` and , '' holden said , `` they too will go back to sol system to face trials . '' .	We figure out who the perpetrators are .	when
4	102350	Visigoths and a hundred other nationalities , they kept a front rank of men with large shields .	The romans advanced on the goths .	when
2	72665	I hated admitting that to her .	I knew the only way we would make us work was if i was honest with her .	but
0	160119	To go through them line by line .	See if anything had been left out of the copies given to me .	and
0	16069	Their wings almost tangled .	Vincet yanked out of his grip .	and
0	118297	So fast your brain locks up .	Gives you this splitting headache .	and
4	62884	She started looking down at her hands .	She washed them in the bathroom .	when
0	39894	He raised his eyes to me , tell me why , he said .	He looked at me with a penetrating stare .	and
0	67085	Blazing through the undergrowth was easy enough to follow .	Such gnak felt he was making good time .	and
2	71472	I was way too old to fall for this shit .	I 'd wanted so badly to believe i was special .	but
2	91122	He was right to be cautious .	The feeling inside me was .	but
2	51255	There were some delays due to false alarms from the sensor equipment .	This was to be expected .	but
2	147197	It shocked him , and he gave no outward reaction .	Something inside of him whimpered .	but
0	87713	Had he detected vik , who was watching for her .	Decided not to go through with it .	and
0	15615	She clipped the bangle onto her wrist .	Hung the pendant around her neck .	and
4	31512	So with her making eight , the same as saint brigid , all those many years .	She founded her first convent .	when
4	90184	He was passing by a pair of oak trees .	They started to shimmer and glow .	when
2	126001	I mean i was at those places .	So were a lot of other people .	but
0	91742	Kathie lee ripped away from the crew member refilling her glass .	Caused him to spill a couple of drops on the floor .	and
2	124801	Jordan had a bit of a cough as she went in .	It didnt seem to be anything to be concerned about .	but
0	136218	Chapter 2 peter sat in one of the red folding camp chairs at the bow of the ship .	Waited as celeste checked on their dinner .	and
1	898	To say , harder to do .	As soon as you agree on a combination theory , then you have to start making little micro-decisions for each and every situation .	because
4	57091	You lack proper energy .	I could help you .	when
2	122254	At first i thought he was going to offer to shake hands with me .	Instead he gave me a business card .	but
3	90344	She had to find a complete calm and focus .	She had any chance at all against so great an evil .	if
0	96417	Excited , seth stuffed the note in his pocket .	Set off down the path .	and
2	102175	His sword sheared a church soldier almost in half .	The man in the red tunic did not even flinch .	but
0	25513	Relieved at not being at the mercy of the elements , he turned .	Glanced to the rain coming down in what his grandma always called a gully washer .	and
3	106076	Now , is a third reason to raise awareness .	You keep an accurate record of the barometric pressure and notice that the pressure is falling steadilyand it is presently 28.8 and droppingthat .	if
0	100486	I wrote my message on a library computer during third bell study hall .	Then xeroxed it on sheets of yellow , pink , red , and turquoise paper .	and
4	94250	He sounded calm . '' .	He said , `` looks like he 's chosen the lawyer route , nina .	when
0	37390	Her anger seemed to have dissipated .	She flicked his arm with her finger in amusement .	and
3	144419	And , we would find some way of getting him out of the university .	He finds out that he is wrong .	if
3	124331	Next time we stop , we should see .	The center stashed any weapons in .	if
0	83261	They knew in their hearts that the arrival of the dreamers would change all the world .	Nothing thereafter would ever be the same .	and
0	51831	The light snow fell lightly around us .	Was sticking to the ground in bits .	and
2	14275	Never usually do formal gowns .	This one is gucci and gorgeous and took three weeks of begging the stepfather before he buckled .	but
0	51756	He did look sick , but echo had already underestimated him .	He was in no shape to run or fight .	and
0	35566	Cat-like she was in each step .	Each step revved up their hearts blood circulation until the speed heated their bodies to sweating .	and
2	153783	After all the cosmic spookiness id just read through , this coincidence seemed bizarre .	I quickly understood that this was a monthly gathering for so called open minded adults , sponsored by new college and held at their downtown building .	but
0	43760	I turned back toward her .	Took her hands in mine .	and
0	46874	Taking advantage of this luxury , i turned on lights .	Started the beach boys record sitting on rolfs old machine .	and
0	86546	Sliding one on my back .	Getting a grip on the other two with my hands .	and
3	152917	`` would you mind ? '' .	We went back to my hotel room .	if
1	129432	Maybe i only want you .	Youve made it so clear you dont want me .	because
2	28923	He was fucking her single-mindedly .	He was doing something else to her .	but
3	123023	Pet , well send in the sas , john , her aeroplane companion joked , to a good deal of geordie laughter .	We dont see you .	if
4	109079	She knows , and she doesnt do it .	She would be wasting her time .	when
0	26840	Fitted for a locket yourself .	Becoming a full-fledged apothynom .	and
0	98631	She 'd had her hands around his neck , squeezing the life out of him .	Had almost finished the job .	and
3	74082	She could have it .	She 's in there with him .	if
0	70397	The police or military arrived .	Tried to break the perimeter .	and
2	101604	Jeisa could have eased herself off jeremy .	She did n't . .	but
0	55560	Just like that , another memory from the past surfaced and .	She remembered lucas parker doing the eyebrow thing when she was young .	and
2	88952	I had no sword .	This was sharp and broad and would have to do .	but
3	70913	We can establish terms for what you 'll do for me when it happens .	You 're really worried about pissing me off .	if
1	109748	When i was being beaten to death by a soldier .	He saved me and nursed me back to health .	because
2	89642	I took that class to sit next to one man . '' .	Ended up falling in love with his best friend .	but
1	85707	Clearly she sensed it .	Her voice was then in my head .	because
1	41145	To be susceptible to the flow of power .	It was the first time since the dragon had shoved her onto the upper cavern ledge that she had encountered the light , delicate touch of flowing energy .	because
2	33528	Not to run upstairs and then again , i 'd hate to see him going at it with emily .	Wrap my hands around drake 's throat .	but
2	78	We were still having a party for her friends at school .	Our family wanted something separate and that was fine by me .	but
0	98104	We 're in a hotel for the day in northern mississippi . '' .	I was going to see if i could get you ready for bed without waking you .	and
0	127365	The pain seemed to be fading .	Its absence left me giddy .	and
2	107684	I knew he was the only man i could ever want , hurt his pride .	I was concerned about rushing him and also knew my father had hurt him .	but
0	100160	My mind was knotted .	There was no untangling it .	and
3	43781	My parents had kept it from me .	So anyone got to be offended i thought i won that award .	if
0	15722	Almost a month mab dies . '' .	Every shark in the ashland underworld is still going at it trying to grab as much power as he can .	and
2	103872	Two large men came out of the back office .	With one look at rontego , they nodded their heads and went .	but
2	148488	Fabian tried to look blase .	He was almost quivering in excitement .	but
0	92012	Before i could protest , he spoke a few words to the sphere above his head .	It zoomed soundlessly into the darkness .	and
4	58363	She was standing in the middle of the room , holding a sheet around her .	I opened the door .	when
2	142659	To say , i know .	There 's just no way around it .	but
0	108907	Having a branch pin you down and crush your vital organs , bloody monsters making disturbing hellish howls , the forest option seemed like a more reasonable way to die .	Being eaten alive by hundreds of mutilating .	and
4	49495	Cadin went to the bar and poured himself a martini .	Michele got up to use the powder room .	when
0	34118	It seemed like he played .	The song lasted for the rest of the evening .	and
0	43188	Oselika had memorized the location of the sword that the demon had lost .	Had arranged to land next to it .	and
2	121515	In the afternoon he made himself speed up a little .	He could not force himself to twist the throttle any farther once the speedometer needle had reached twenty , not even if he could see the road was clear .	but
2	31366	The killer had tried to cover the blood stains with leaves .	Gareth removed them with a few swipes of his boot .	but
4	131862	And , she could see the caring wizard she '' d fallen for , not the remote bastard he '' d played these past days .	She looked into his eyes .	when
0	152739	We went inside then headed up to my bedroom .	Grabbed the box of pizza and some plates .	and
2	131773	I figured the reason all of the infected were crawling on the outside was that they could figure out windows , or smash them .	Doors were more of a challenge .	but
0	16498	I sat outside in the courtyard and the one scarlet and white carp .	Stared at the two white carp .	and
4	19212	Listening to cales amazing voice .	All id be thinking about was sex .	when
3	121225	It yearned for allan , for his dear face and his promises .	Even she now feared they meant nothing .	if
0	34872	Then his body came unstuck .	He walked down the dark hall with her , down the stairs , his hand in hers , his body .	and
2	34089	We waited a moment longer .	No one appeared on the path below .	but
0	152371	His hands made fists .	He closed his eyes .	and
0	78497	They invade her mind . '' .	Turn it into a big gelatinous puddle of crap .	and
2	24497	The ship would ever again float .	The planks aboard the ship could be used to build other boats .	but
2	32218	It was a quick , perfunctory kiss , nothing like the kisses in her dream or the ones in the shelter of the tower wall .	She hardly expected such in front of so many people .	but
2	58785	`` do it , '' she breathes out in a voice so low it 's barely audible .	It 's all i need .	but
3	8715	The violence will be very real .	Steel chairs or ring bells or blood shows up .	if
3	115429	`` , my golden doe , i can see your father mourning your mother long after her death .	So she gave you your eyes .	if
4	37554	I loved it , and wed sing along to grateful dead tunes while we drank and smoked and laughed .	Someone moved in who could play guitar .	when
0	86630	The valg prince advanced .	Part of her was screaming-screaming at herself to get up , to keep fighting , to rage and roar against this horrible end .	and
0	36851	She scraped a patch of ground bare with her foot .	Picked up a stick .	and
2	21354	That was a large burden for one short female .	He would help her .	but
2	20096	We were watching some program about ghosts .	I could tell that ryan was looking mostly at me .	but
1	32304	I brought you with me today . '' .	This is the official business of kenos and you are a valuable employee of the city .	because
2	43324	There 's a poem to help remember the gestures .	The only two words you have to say are latin .	but
0	77485	First of all , it skirted a vast lake .	That would be a spectacular vast lake .	and
0	66298	Who both attend galdon academy .	Live with their lawyer mother .	and
0	94537	There were numerous tufted stools .	The most spectacular tapestries everywhere i 'd yet observed .	and
4	152071	You never would 've assumed what they are , correct .	You first met daemon and his family .	when
0	48968	It stole over him that he 'd probably sold enough things for .	He might as well go home and spend a quiet night in a barrel in the root cellar with a sack over his head .	and
2	4698	Chapter eighteen lin screamed as the red-hot coal singed her palms .	She did not let go of tam .	but
0	20826	Simmons pulled strings for this .	He says ill get a regional oversight post , responsible for intel operations in the americas , outside the u.s. , of course .	and
0	143532	The men were very focused on their drinking .	Were blinded by the light .	and
4	96602	Rape and pillage , it is you who are acting .	They kill and maim .	when
3	84162	He 'd be cutting it .	The storm progressed at this rate .	if
2	111445	The older meregal had suffered .	His suit had retained a few rips in his sleeve from an unwelcoming lady .	but
0	26370	She held her crystal in the palm of her hand ; she placed it over the crystal .	Took her brothers hand .	and
3	122098	We can . '' .	She was unconscious the whole time .	if
1	119480	Having to go trick-or-treating with neighbors .	His parents had meetings .	because
0	113989	There was an ouija board out on their table .	It seemed like the young woman was trying to talk the other two into using it .	and
4	82673	You 've always been my rock .	The whole world doubted me .	when
4	77162	You made me laugh .	You told me to imagine iggy pop in a dress .	when
4	129937	These days i know she 'd be proud of the decisions i 've made over the last five years . '' .	I think about my mom .	when
2	37492	Hywel was gareths lord and this venture was unique in gareths experience .	Had protected gareth as best he could up until .	but
2	39630	He had never met allie the outcast .	His image of her had been larger than life .	but
2	98103	The lad had not , and , but one in which he could talk fluently only of solid things-and of a very limited future .	So he would have to struggle with the tsalagi , which was an interesting tongue .	but
0	79102	He plucked a single rose from a bush in the garden .	Placed it in the grave with her .	and
4	40349	He sliced the guy from neck to groin .	The first man attacked .	when
2	51767	She got up to rummage through the closet .	The bell rang again , so she walked over , took a deep breath , and reached for the knob .	but
3	60002	I 'd feel better . '' .	We just got on with things .	if
1	110845	Coming up to the door , i started .	It swung open as if by magic .	because
3	53700	They 'd be happy .	She could return even a piece of his love .	if
4	95770	It 's our punishment .	We 're caught breaking the rules .	when
4	21562	Both of them pressed to the floor of the boat , sprays of water flaring in jets around them .	The boat slammed into the bottom of the waterfall .	when
4	52613	Mike was reaching for his wallet , holding her pocketbook .	Julie nudged him out of the way .	when
3	58593	Why is he getting a commendation .	Bradley screwed up so bad .	if
4	84077	I walked through the door and took off my sweatshirt .	I finally made it .	when
3	87087	She was asking me to work for the foundation .	I was hearing her right .	if
0	99407	He took the stone .	Hid it deep inside his underwear draw .	and
4	159289	She sat on the pale yellow blanket , with bed head and shy eyes .	I got out of the shower and made it back to the room .	when
4	50922	Still mulling over the idea still watching her every move .	She looked over and saw the stranger sitting in his car .	when
0	27285	We must hurry make a plan .	I think we are safe for now , but .	and
2	158740	She was certain stump had not seen her .	He was in the city , and of course he had friends .	but
3	6754	It does not matter .	I die this day , for elitha has paid the price of taunting me .	if
2	67361	About her-he 'd been flirty at princeton .	All she knew , he was like that with all girls .	but
3	24441	I shall serve his blood needs . '' .	He comes to me .	if
2	91896	The cook was probably the loudest .	He was getting serious competition from the two men checking the rooms .	but
0	98265	It 's an equal opportunity fetish , '' he said .	With a flourish , offered his arm .	and
4	97148	He was a different kind of guy .	He played with that dog , almost like a younger , freer version of himself .	when
0	125385	The merchant looked doubtful ; after this , he consented at least to take a half-guinea and inspect it .	Addressed some questions to zhao wei .	and
2	16560	Some ancient tale about atlantis had nothing to do with what ander was talking .	She still heard madame blavatsky 's translation run through her head : everything might change with the last word .	but
3	48449	You could get the whole complete story . '' .	You go a little further .	if
0	160774	Now however did they bear it before the king in its new-gleaming splendour ; , and he cast the nauglafring about his throat , and straightway the curse of mim fell upon him .	Then was the joy of tinwelint king of the woodland elves come to its crowning .	and
4	60943	I found that it marked plath 's most famous poem .	I flipped it open to the page .	when
2	106371	Leah also had a head wound , similar to dr. hayes 's , and the missing piece from dr. hayes 's neck was peeking from her mouth .	Her chin and chest were covered in blood .	but
0	151804	To square her shoulders .	Send zev a smile .	and
4	78428	I 'll take the blame for it .	She gets all pissed off .	when
0	28552	Then again , he could have been popping sixty-five on the highway .	It would have felt like he was twiddling his thumbs .	and
2	146798	The intensity of her emotions was shocking .	Denise was too tired to dwell on all the obstacles that made her feelings moot .	but
2	84743	I couldnt do anything violent , that would make me as bad as them .	Ill use every legal way to make sure they never hurt anyone .	but
0	115088	Then each of them untied a thick torch from his saddle , mumbled incantation .	Ignited it with a brief .	and
2	28391	The consequence of my choice to leave you is too high .	My regret is that i am a slow learner .	but
0	79866	She smiled as the pain from the sunlight reached her at last .	Took one last deep breath .	and
2	96773	Later she 'd look through her supplies of pretty paper and calf 's hide .	For the moment she was interested only in cutting , folding , and sewing .	but
0	78010	After arriving at the gate , the bird threw his load on the ground , which caused a minor earthquake .	Said : i am the mahatma bird , the guru bird , and a bird avatar .	and
1	101066	It was initially misdiagnosed as dengue , cholera , or typhoid .	Mostly the symptoms were very ... distinctly un-flu-like .	because
3	146577	You 'll never trade with this planet .	This monster is killed .	if
2	11491	He appeared to know .	Didnt was squeezing his mind for an answer from the past that wasnt .	but
2	135846	I hated to say it .	I had my daddy wrapped around my finger .	but
2	76046	Never minded being shown up in class before : the small room , the look on their faces .	Somehow this is different .	but
3	90722	It was necessary we do what it takes to get power .	Our results are good .	if
3	117611	`` , you can . '' .	You can get him to wake up .	if
1	73078	He was going to suffer a permanent cramp in his dick , and his jeans had cut so tight across it that he 'd existed in a state of pain .	He 'd had a hard-on the entire evening .	because
4	17243	The seagull was not really in very good shape .	Sorgan bought her from the crusty old pirate he 'd happened to meet in a seaside tavern in the maag port of weros .	when
2	12048	You speak the truth , value is only ever decided by needs .	Likewise , if you lived in a coastal town which was under siege and the last ship to leave port was taking highest bids for places on the boat , having a thousand gold crowns would be worth more than a flask of water .	but
0	15206	Their childhoods were spent in happier times conditions than yours .	Your mothers are remarkable people , but .	and
0	157875	I told him where it came from .	He seemed to find the idea somewhat amusing .	and
0	21536	Jael 's face appeared again and .	Each time , he looked worse .	and
4	18333	She had left the door slightly ajar , maleek had been snoring very loudly , one paw covering his nose .	She left the lazy predator .	when
2	33341	`` i will probably regret asking this question , '' he whispered , `` ? '' .	What is in that box .	but
2	106564	The sun had just crested the horizon .	The humidity made the air murky .	but
0	95946	They reminded me of the devil himself .	Made me hesitant to fall .	and
0	98625	It was a hybrid song , `` wet lips , '' always a crowd pleaser .	It brought an explosion of applause from the audience .	and
0	120520	Petr stumbled forward into the darkness .	Slowly felt his way through the undergrowth .	and
4	95478	`` private message , '' he continued , `` online . '' .	I gave him a blank look .	when
2	18690	You kissing olivia , yeah , that threw me for a minute .	I knew my chances from the start .	but
2	64743	I mean , joanna is sweet too , of course .	As high-school girlfriends go , she was just so ... pleasant .	but
1	142044	Doesnt mean you have to .	Just the rest of the world has gone to shit .	because
2	127026	You could poke it with a stick .	That would upset the servants .	but
4	56746	In proximity to mary ann , they were once again dormant .	He 'd heard them .	when
2	8831	Beth 's mother had been a victim .	Beth had somehow managed to transcend the horrors of her childhood .	but
4	154918	I felt like i had just come from sodom and gomorrah .	I came out of that theater .	when
3	125304	Then you 'll find out .	You 're blind or .	if
2	5088	I know i should touch myself just to find some relief .	What i want from him is so far beyond sex .	but
2	121284	And ashe had searched for her .	Was unable to turn any recent leads to her possible whereabouts .	but
3	147797	She 'd be free .	She helped him bring me in .	if
3	85032	You would never intentionally hurt me .	That 's what you 're asking .	if
1	53806	If he does , though , i think i 'd rather not know .	That means he can call me but chooses not to .	because
0	114409	Tar hung his head .	Then looked in her eyes one last time .	and
1	50906	True , i am just emotional .	I heard that she wants to impose hindi on us .	because
2	123709	It pinched the bridge of his nose .	He could smell mint , which was far better than cow farts .	but
3	111558	I was wondering , whether we could rent it for a few weeks . '' .	You still had the house in marseille , and if .	if
0	67978	Kat directed her sight at the leader .	Realized , the k-99s are wearing protective steel visors .	and
2	29636	I dont know what you did with johnny .	You wont get away with it .	but
3	17977	Victory would be theirs .	Her divinity was in reach .	if
0	104837	After a late lunch , we head to the hotel , unpack the essentials decide to rest for the remainder of the day .	Check into our suite .	and
0	160737	Shuffled in his seat .	Attempted to butt in .	and
0	138702	How the residential neighborhood had changed , many of the large houses converted to apartment buildings and commercial sites .	Most of the plane trees lining the street severely trimmed or removed .	and
3	81821	Then this horrible nightmare will be .	I can just make it back to my bed .	if
4	34157	Feel free to talk with some of the sample olympians .	We go to the final room on the tour .	when
0	160491	In the hermitage they meditated , drank sacred water seeping from the rocks of the most sacred mountains in hilly forest red hill .	Slowly started to descend .	and
2	5736	*** not all trips by car were good trips , reflected jonathan .	It remained only possible to escape the auditorium by bus , tram , or begging a lift .	but
4	21218	Still , she was out of breath .	She reached the fourth floor .	when
0	157203	When her heartbeat was no more than a whisper , when she lay across his lap like a pale rag doll , he bit into his wrist .	Held the bleeding wound to her lips .	and
2	135354	Sure , he had gone out with lots o ' gals and now that he thought back it was better , much better when josh was .	They seemed to like him .	but
0	139636	Everyone and everything else had disappeared except for me , the goddess vic .	The next i 'd stil been in the library , but .	and
2	129315	They worked together to build their nest , with the help of mcadams himself and several other workers from the business who had all experienced ems fiery temper from time to time .	Who all loved her like a sister .	but
4	7521	To smooth things over with presents-a beautiful porcelain doll .	Meredith missed one of sheree 's ballet recitals .	when
2	110349	You will love someone again , and and strong , and they will love you .	They will be good .	but
4	1674	Nick was packing up his stuff .	Shane noticed how tense his shoulders were .	when
3	122568	So you can perform surgery , but you cant make those same cuts if you believe you are killing them .	You believe you are helping someone .	if
0	79105	Acutely uncomfortable , neil cleared his throat .	Said , i , em , im very sorry that i invaded your home , mr. wekogono .	and
4	105128	Had had an accident .	One of his cart wheels went into a rut .	when
2	160719	I am obviously not good at that i dont know yet what exactly this is going to be .	I am pretty certain that it will be something legal .	but
2	73101	I scan the crowd looking for my target .	I 'm not sure who i 'm looking for .	but
0	55171	I run up to her .	Beg her to come with me .	and
4	34646	Picking that exact moment .	They knew we were at our most vulnerable .	when
0	28824	He remembered the crescent blade all .	It was shaking in the grass .	and
3	157465	Still even if she took the chance to trust him , how on earth would she get in touch with him .	Even tyrone might consent to help her .	if
4	1755	The females looked at each other .	There were no more .	when
1	100060	`` , elizabeth chapman .	I 'm taking you to my home .	because
2	158343	Callum has the advantage , and he bought his power at too high a price . '' .	He 'll kill you all .	but
0	21458	Me losing myself in him .	I pull away and look into his eyes .	and
2	91854	On friday he asked her to go to a concert .	She had set up the meeting with joe duggan , the computer expert , and she hesitated .	but
0	129101	They assaulted the towers , shooting arrows into the ports of the towers .	Made progress there by shear numbers .	and
4	34464	* * * the 605 freeway was finally clearing up .	Joey 's cell phone rang .	when
2	146537	It would have left her with few friends .	It would never have grown into the terrifying beast she now faced .	but
0	26408	She shifted on her feet .	Leaned in closer to his shoulder to try and get a better look at whoever it was he found so magnificent .	and
0	5127	That was the one thing he would never be able to do .	He didnt want to make his position untenable he had better stop ignoring her .	and
3	101882	How they would get out of it .	Something were to go wrong .	if
3	55499	It 'll put him out of commission long enough for you to take his head .	He shows up when you 're .	if
0	31352	`` bend down . '' .	Pick up my chalice .	and
1	75958	He tried to focus on that despair .	As bad as it would be , if he kept the ship and lost his crew , that would feel worse .	because
1	150982	Put on my most political comportment .	It was obvious what kind of business he did from the back of a body shop , with loose hours , carrying a firearm .	because
4	154164	John made sarcastic finger quote marks .	He said blank and then continued .	when
0	90259	I 'm quite certain it would thrill him to no end . '' .	Make us all feel better that you care .	and
2	93686	She was armed as her comrades were .	Bore an emblem for both rayan and her two-quarter leadership on her uniform .	but
1	95233	I turned off the dvd player , as my mind was still on the gorgeous tutor .	It was impossible to concentrate on the film .	because
2	121975	Eckxio tried to look down each tunnel .	He saw nothing but darkness .	but
2	125783	She couldnt make them all out .	There were at least eight .	but
2	120176	Oshs heart felt like it was going to break .	He knew , what had to be done .	but
2	70128	You think it necessary i will go .	I prefer to experience this journey to its fullest .	but
0	156264	With that , she turned .	Proceeded to walk elegantly ahead of us .	and
0	74662	When not daydreaming and gently knocking , since it was saturday and she never works the weekends .	Took two corners before finding room five thirteen .	and
2	142866	I can keep him calm while its done .	Ive never put in stitches before .	but
0	94359	He jerked in surprise at our sudden arrival .	Put a hand to his chest .	and
3	123010	They may know about the island .	The fire warriors are moving against us .	if
2	19244	She comforted the lad .	No one argued against his words .	but
3	13780	Then perhaps i could get him to see there was another way .	I could get king to see past his greed .	if
0	128016	It 's good . '' .	You can eat it without a knife .	and
0	119289	The borothorn reached for his sword on his waist .	He could draw it .	and
0	37262	Frost was standing a little back to one side , and doyle mirrored him , but .	They both stood so that they were somehow clearly facing off with the bodyguards on the steps .	and
0	121700	At that point the door was already completely open .	All three of them went in .	and
4	56705	God , i 'm going to have my hands full . '' .	He becomes a teenager .	when
2	22643	The hotel was full of people who would only see the candidate 's daughter .	Right then-right there-there was no doubt who macey mchenry had to be .	but
2	46085	It would take her a few days to go through them .	At least hed have a little peace of mind at the end of it .	but
4	14897	The only moment that stands out in my mind was .	I slipped the ring on her finger .	when
0	78472	His face became sad .	He looked at ash .	and
2	77350	Most moulages faded with the sun .	Murder left a stronger impression that could last weeks or even centuries if the crime was heinous enough and the spirit desperate to continue life .	but
2	24719	The loud voices called out my name many times .	I tried to ignore them .	but
2	139784	I know the names .	You 'd need to ask someone who has studied it what the exact difference is .	but
3	5095	But , i think i could start getting the hang of the place .	You can find us a beer .	if
0	64495	Fiona shook her head .	Grinned at the cat .	and
0	128414	One day , she would have missed someone . '' .	Word of your presence would have leaked .	and
0	60485	He dropped like he 'd been ko 'd .	Nic spun to face the second soldier .	and
0	38306	I pinned his left arm down the same way .	Put the bat on my shoulder .	and
2	9539	It was almost startling the way my heart felt like it was being stabbed with a stickpin .	I ignored the dull ache and led him over to the stairs .	but
3	159720	Her babies would be .	She failed to free them .	if
0	68840	I pushed the door away from the wall hurried after him .	Slipped out from behind it .	and
0	64761	It was raw needy and .	Exactly what she desired .	and
2	75252	It differed from the ordinary egyptian style .	From her rather technical account i merely got the impression that it was a strangely shaped affair carved with characters neither cuneiform nor hieroglyphic .	but
2	118916	Glancing to his backside , robinson searched for outstretched white wings .	Only found a pale naked figure lurking closely , staring curiously at robinson .	but
2	48414	I took a hesitant step .	Jenks was faster , and before trent could even get past the horses , the pixy was in his face , dripping a silver-tinted red dust .	but
2	154621	He first saw one with the corner of his left eye , a wisp of pale sheen that faded .	Others appeared soon after : some like dimly shining smoke , some like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles ; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands .	but
0	756	To write travel stories .	Come up with a plan for the future , not eye up every sexy stranger like a child in a sweet shop .	and
4	85628	Where he spends time .	He 's not at the field office .	when
0	58248	He closed his eyes .	Let the rattling of the van help him drift off to sleep .	and
3	6283	It would make your boobs pop-out right .	You hold that thing closer .	if
0	132581	He swung his arms .	Kicked out his legs .	and
0	78823	She walked up to him , a force of nature packaged in a pinafore .	Put her small hand flat on his chest .	and
4	124821	No man knew , but gabriel knew with a single wrist-flick he could decide quickly for most .	Death would call their name .	when
2	153497	`` i apologize . '' .	The few discussions i 've had with my werewolf confidante do not broach those subjects .	but
2	15058	Obviously there had to be other entrances .	Why not just come in the front .	but
3	36620	At least he had the grace not to say .	Edmure thought her a curious sort of lady .	if
2	61389	She might have created an amazing career and bank account for herself during the past ten years .	Even as a broke eighteen-year-old overwhelmed by the crowded city streets of san francisco , she 'd never been this frightened .	but
2	139187	If she would 've pushed him away , or told him no , he would 've somehow been able to release her .	She was just as hungry for him as he was for her .	but
2	43087	She chafed about the delay .	Approved of the reason .	but
4	95242	I 'd saved felipe 's life .	One of sophie-anne 's bodyguards had been well on the way to killing him .	when
3	47125	She 'd say she 'd gotten her appointments mixed up and had gone shopping .	By some chance he came looking for her .	if
3	88350	Really , dantalion , you should be embracing evil with me .	You hope to gain more strength .	if
0	148479	The legion arrived outside of rome a few days .	You hadnt reported in .	and
2	99934	The man might not yell .	He made up for it in quality .	but
3	155418	`` , we have one course of action , professor -- to start cooperating with the one person who seems to know where he is . '' .	We want to find mr. solomon .	if
4	106213	Several pairs of eyes glared at us .	We climbed out of the truck with our paints and brushes and walked over to the wall .	when
1	47322	They cherished every moment they had with their beautiful girls knowing , they shouldnt be parents at all .	Both of their power bases being the same .	because
0	140442	He had so far worked out .	Baer wondered at the man his brother had become .	and
0	56130	He 'll hear you .	Will act on it .	and
4	137786	That suddenly turns into a high pitched squeal .	I reached down and squeeze her ass .	when
0	109218	Someone 's dog had gone missing .	The owner had filed a missing person 's report .	and
3	104522	They began to wonder .	That had really been an accident at all .	if
2	26822	Suddenly thinking about candace , i stand up , and tell them , `` we 'll go we 're staying with you . '' .	Taking mark 's side .	but
0	125723	Victoria heard the gravel in her voice .	Decided it would be prudent to step farther away from sebastian .	and
3	135141	Does it matter how easy the journey is .	You dont know where youre going .	if
0	16729	A small figure lay in a hospital bed in intensive care , her head swathed in bandages .	Casts on both arms that lay upon the bed .	and
4	69478	`` a sidhe princess should know , '' he said , arms still crossed .	She 's being tricksied about with .	when
4	153470	It literally burnt , leaving a strangely poisonous red mark on the ground .	The drops of potion touched the grass .	when
2	125084	I take a breath , bracing myself .	Instead the lawyer clicks again , to the next photo .	but
4	56901	Rigo and norian were well on their way to a strong friendship .	We got back to the others .	when
2	23458	It went by the name of samson and a blend of the two .	It 's projection was neither a man or a woman .	but
3	93015	They 're coming to live with you . '' .	You spoil my boys .	if
0	133069	My folks buried me in the yard in the dead of night .	Told everyone they 'd sent me off to live with relatives .	and
0	57559	In this case i am now very rich then think his way along it .	Draw a line between the two .	and
1	153486	Owen must have sensed me staring at him .	He turned in my direction and smiled - a big , broad , beautiful smile that told me how happy he was that i was .	because
4	28403	Getting mixed up with some drug .	I turned so readily to alcohol to ease my own tension .	when
0	41798	A man , quite possibly insane , lay burned .	Wounded in her arms .	and
2	37063	The fenrir was bleeding .	The wound had no effect on its strength and only increased its resolve .	but
3	70652	I will seriously kill you guys .	This turns out to be a joke .	if
0	51467	The voices above had moved away from their area .	She hoped they were going .	and
3	33878	Find daddy drunk or mama crazy .	They came to my home .	if
2	123491	That is none of your busin rick started to complain .	The screen lit back up with abbys image .	but
2	134501	He was already on his feet and .	Heading towards the door .	but
4	160096	She did for me in dr. patel 's office .	That certain song came on .	when
4	140449	We cried , and my mother held us both to her bosom and sobbed so loudly that both the maid and the cook wanted to call the doctor because they thought something had happened to my father .	We told my mother later that afternoon .	when
0	26880	Both of them got up laughing , but cristobal went running first to the suzuki to pick up the sledgehammer .	Went to the shop .	and
2	6808	Alcee beck , in particular , was scared to death of me , though i 'd demonstrated it for him .	Even he was quite oblivious to my ability .	but
2	115310	Dwarfs have hips , of course .	They seldom know what to do with them .	but
2	72061	He looked behind him .	He saw nothing but panic stricken beeves .	but
0	101391	He only laughed went back to our lineage-compound .	'' i said , but .	and
2	12284	Brin and clara had been walking along for several days , off upon their as yet unknown adventure .	The weather was lovely and the scenery breathtaking , which stirred something within their young hearts that felt adventuring must be the most wonderful thing in all the world .	but
0	29410	Sliding dipping inside with intrusive demanding thrusts .	Taking her mouth with his tongue , his taste sweet .	and
2	75199	You 'd get thrown off the island .	Probably you 'd get thrown into the can .	but
4	2417	She was demanding a response .	I thought that i could get away with leaving all her questions unanswered .	when
2	24253	Ordinarily , the range was not open to the public .	Wayne was the law enforcement liaison to the club and as such had a key to the gate .	but
2	64880	They offered to come back tomorrow .	I told them we would handle it ourselves .	but
4	2226	He lunged for the room , then paused at the door for a quick reconnoiter .	He heard a window slide .	when
3	139201	You 've got everything , '' he tries , and the other two snicker .	You 've got your health .	if
4	154183	Crombie had a nose like a bloodhound .	It came to rhyllann .	when
0	34194	He also removed a young man and a young girl from the streets , even though both were not of age when taken in .	Forced them into having sex .	and
0	55610	These are the larrakia , '' the dragonet said , `` who had me from the pitjantjatjara , who had me from the wiradjuri .	Pray do not be angry , for they needed me .	and
4	40622	I 'll email you . '' .	So you wake up there 'll be a message waiting for you .	when
0	27877	To stand by the altar began .	Wait as the long procession of bridesmaids and groomsmen .	and
0	25284	Who was paranoid about any form of opposition .	Since the cabinet had concluded that the rebels were from within the police force , james reynolds was in the firing line .	and
2	6159	Set it for 5:00 .	I usually wake up before that .	but
4	14830	Bodo untied my bandage .	We got to the shower .	when
0	41748	It is a further threat to freedom and democracy .	May be used to target them .	and
0	80147	So colette tried hers .	She liked it as much as i did .	and
3	47360	Then he could handle a hit in the $ 20 million range .	His list stopped with seven names .	if
0	31526	I 'd wondered about the terms of the deal valerie had made with shay .	Now they were inescapably clear .	and
2	3998	This one was blonde , tall and willowy , almost frail looking .	Her appearance was extremely deceptive .	but
0	85873	We were just talking . '' .	I looked back in the mirror to ask her what we should get her little friend , when she pointed out over the seat and screamed for me to look out .	and
2	26685	For life is hard here in the heat .	I must toil or i wont eat .	but
3	124572	But then you wonder .	He meant for her to run to him .	if
2	127864	Her eye colour , unlike her kind , never changed .	She was old enough to choose what colour she would like her body to be .	but
3	158600	Before leaving , paul asked the general .	He could see his son and nephew .	if
2	7350	I 'm afraid we 're leaving now . '' .	It was so nice to chat with you , phoebe .	but
4	131641	He tensed and held his breath .	She nibbled a path to his neck .	when
2	48024	The shadowed figures had yet to move .	Their study of him was unnerving .	but
0	85205	Where the berry bushes were .	They picked every one that was left .	and
0	69404	Henry carried cael inside .	Laid him gently on the closest bed .	and
1	58849	She wanted to understand something about the girl they were connected in some deep sense .	It seemed that , whatever strange differences they had in where they grew up and how they were raised .	because
2	3449	I knew all she wanted to do was protect me .	She 'd torn me away from the one promising friendship of my childhood .	but
4	159239	At one time we 'd felt .	We 'd had to work together on the board of a charity .	when
1	93565	He gave it free rein .	These bastards needed to die .	because
4	139589	How could i feel so uneasy around david .	I craved being around greyson .	when
0	107825	`` run , '' he urged under his breath .	Waved toward the open castle gates .	and
2	129560	He slipped down further in his chair , still holding a clutch of the receipts .	His eyes no longer looking at what was printed .	but
3	62191	I will forsake the others , but i want to marry you . '' .	You insist i must .	if
2	137209	I stood up and he just used it to pull me back down on the floor with him .	Gave him my hand .	but
2	30274	I thought id find the renegade here , he said .	Tir could hear the lie in his voice .	but
0	54923	So you 've enjoyed his body for the evening .	Now arrive to enjoy mine for the day .	and
2	129129	Waiting near the eastern ridge , keeping a low profile among the trees .	He was in bad shape .	but
0	2615	He stroked her cheek one last time .	Ran his thumb across her lower lip , pleasantly swollen from his kiss .	and
2	57318	The human kneeling at cronus 's side jerked at the threat , mewling sounds seeping from his bloody lips .	He never spoke a word .	but
2	127873	He shot charlotte a worried glance .	Pasted a smile on his face , obviously playing it light with his mother .	but
0	145268	Students began referring to me as dr. doom and finally under growing pressure i relinquished my tenure .	Went into retirement at fifty-eight .	and
0	3855	Hannibal nodded his consent .	She turned to her laptop .	and
3	23777	We would not be what we are , we would never have been what we are .	We were to be seen .	if
3	83378	Perhaps a bit of wedding cake ? '' .	You eat every last drop .	if
4	2973	He died in the line of duty . '' .	I was a baby .	when
3	140507	I 'd kill you right now easier than a mosquito . '' .	I thought you did anything to her like you did to me .	if
0	154930	It had been built around the birth of christ , and if history was at all accurate , the legio xxi rapax should have just moved in .	Has since been called home by the legio xiii gemina .	and
0	20740	Why cant kshaloka be vain , eh .	Tilja can be frumpy .	and
2	58695	Paul ash did not invite me to travel around the country with him .	There was one interesting fallout from the paul ash contest .	but
2	100458	Unfortunately , wrestling changed .	The memories of those gimmicks stuck with their owners .	but
0	137665	Patrice miller had been a nurse for almost twenty years .	She said shed give him a quick once over to see if he did have a concussion , although she emphasised that she was not a doctor .	and
0	129229	It was only meant to be worn by the emperor .	I had to control myself to not spring up from bed and tear the robes from his body .	and
0	135294	For one thing the holiday was supposed to last for two weeks , so he should have plenty of time to sort things out before bloom returned .	It ended as well as started .	and
2	73571	She brought sweet memories of things that i have not seen in such a long time .	You do have some of that courage of hers .	but
2	55510	She hardly ever came this way , it was far quicker to go down the back stairs .	She just wanted to check .	but
3	109374	Her family 's smug patronizing would veil a calm assurance that he 'd wise up at some point .	Even he started seeing her .	if
0	127479	To put the gold .	Just kept staring at it .	and
4	97089	At first i dont remember who i am .	I wake up after a death .	when
4	67051	She only referred to him as matt , the first half of his last name .	There was a situation in which caution was the utmost importance .	when
0	113757	Fred looked up from sorting out new comics .	Broke into a wide grin when he saw who stood outside .	and
1	117477	Luke had gone to his apartment , so she was .	He had to be at the base by seven in the morning .	because
2	157703	Unlike hudson , david 's protective mode was subtle .	I recognized it in his face all the same .	but
4	136782	How violated i felt .	They murdered my own sweet little mother with their obama care boondoggle .	when
0	116909	You are wed. '' ramsay slammed down his cup .	The dregs of his ale erupted across the tablecloth .	and
4	32516	She had recognized him .	She had expected to see only strangers .	when
2	145491	You 've had your dick in another man 's mouth . '' .	Gee , no biggie , there was a chick there to keep it all aboveboard and hetero .	but
0	108844	It was an angarak building .	Angaraks put walls around everything - even pig-pens .	and
3	129268	`` , then yes . '' .	What she believes is true .	if
3	50185	What he himself would do .	He looked at her .	if
2	134871	He stood up and , covering the tight contours of his muscular torso leaving his tattooed sleeves exposed .	Pulled a black tank top over his head .	but
0	6067	He 's my gerard . '' .	He 'll always be .	and
3	54728	To live with myself .	Anything were to happen to any of them .	if
2	79903	The trout leaped out of the water .	It could not shake the hook .	but
2	44665	They could be quite useful for defense , if dug in .	Had very limited utility for an encounter fight .	but
2	24458	Almost fell over trying to turn around .	All he saw was more foliage .	but
4	80052	To put the idea in their minds .	They could do nothing about it .	when
0	22502	He closed his eyes , about the sweet tang of the honey mustard he 'd licked from her lips .	Thought about facing her over the desk .	and
2	80238	We all started laughing .	Mine was more of a nervous laugh .	but
0	142712	That claimed me so that i can just die all .	Thrust me into the next life .	and
2	106096	I was tempted to send a message to alistair to quit yammering .	Then i 'd screw it all up .	but
0	41547	He had left a dirty pot in the sink at his home back in massachusetts .	He would think about it .	and
4	61172	Still sloane could see that she was drained .	They finally left the station two hours .	when
2	23400	Debated just running back to my room and staying .	The urge to see murphy was pulling at me .	but
0	94615	I told you shes jinxed .	Needs to be destroyed .	and
0	117861	Qwella touched each of the hinges .	Welded the door shut .	and
0	82361	A warrior from another world came .	Told the townsfolk to raise arms and defend this kingdom .	and
2	92294	He 'd washed eve 's blood off his hands .	He could almost still feel that blood coating his fingertips .	but
2	21262	She started to move past them .	The short fellow reached up a hand and tried to restrain her .	but
0	101726	He twisted open a butterfly knife .	Plunged it into arik 's side .	and
0	16990	He had once been a claviger .	Had spent his life on the fringe of immortal society .	and
0	52898	It was a bad idea , i sent my fingers to find his .	He started at the tiny squeeze , returning it full force .	and
2	120191	He took a swing at jie .	It only glanced off his helmet .	but
0	20586	His pole extended , ready to throw the bobber with its maximum weight .	Flipped back behind his shoulder .	and
0	17710	The girl stomps to the fish .	Picking up a stone , efficiently dispatches them .	and
2	59363	I didnt know how much hair weighed .	I had a feeling the dot doctor wasnt going to be impressed by the collection of cellulite that i store under my belt .	but
0	156300	I 'm left there standing with those soldiers .	I have no idea what 's going on .	and
2	904	Nathan shoved his hands into the grass , trying to push himself .	He was too weak , too disoriented to maintain his balance .	but
2	13892	This is strictly conjectured . '' .	It 's possible that the majority of goobot 's soldiers are employed in some sort of civil war on his planet .	but
0	7253	I will celebrate with you . '' .	I will mourn with you .	and
0	42612	Despite his own shivering , mateo shrugged off his jacket .	Slipped it around her shoulders .	and
3	24646	To get your shit and leave and not sit down and see .	We can work on finding a future we both believe in .	if
2	116997	It seemed like a sure thing to find someone whod lived in a small town for sixteen or more years .	Neither of us spoke of what we would do if we didnt find anyone .	but
4	21800	Which ken found out .	He opened the door : naked as the day was long , illuminated only by the small nightlight in the corner .	when
0	17236	His brain kicked into gear .	He dropped his drink and threw himself to one side , out of the way of my deadly strike .	and
0	5195	Natasha thought the same thing .	They smiled at each other , barely containing a laugh .	and
4	28003	She 'd just slipped off , knowing she 'd never be the wife he needed her to be .	She realized her circumstance .	when
4	136028	No one knew you were a charmer .	You went into the pack .	when
4	34902	Danielle and i felt the same way about our guys . '' .	We first met them .	when
2	16717	That 's a stupid question , he thought .	He hid his irritation .	but
0	39118	I shall go off on my own leave the two of you to fend for yourselves .	`` if you interrupt me one more time , '' said the fox , `` one more time , i will not only stop talking , but . '' .	and
0	53153	That would be slightly odd , hovering around freezing .	Considering it was the middle of the night .	and
3	15461	How could he possibly watch out for me .	He becomes as twisted and sick as the rest of the fallen .	if
1	63032	He was trying hard to blend in with the crowd .	I kept catching him staring at me before ducking behind a pillar or a bulky investor .	because
0	21324	The fire burned low .	The last faggot was thrown on .	and
2	54357	People standing in it looking at him as far as thasper knew , nothing had happened since he soared to the middle-region with his father .	There was a wood around thasper , and .	but
4	80795	Nor heard his groan .	You ( because you had sworn to do it ) must shake him and force him to rise .	when
3	18420	We can delay their mission . '' .	Jpl gets the payload done in time .	if
2	120768	We had not been able to rent a house at the seaside .	The lakes were the next best thing .	but
0	31798	But after a heated argument with his brother , michael , he had abruptly left for a fishing trip .	Had forgotten to make williams masking potion .	and
2	44725	Not killed , maybe . '' .	Put back to sleep .	but
3	110667	You asking ? '' .	It 's easy to kill and walk .	if
2	159226	When she had been stabbed .	They were always healing .	but
0	82192	The electricity under my skin flared for a moment .	I felt a surge of heat rush through my body .	and
4	159860	You left the lights .	You vacated the premises last night and also neglected to punch out .	when
0	66943	She had grown up in the dukedom of louisiana , on the family estate .	Although her duty took her from the colony all the way to the capital of the empire of gaul , she had missed it .	and
2	148955	Some morning , he knew , this ritual would fail him ; , there to wrestle with waste and oxygen , to stoke the fires and clean the flues in accordance with his karma .	Until that day he would ride the glistening elevator down amid the glutinous loam to his work in the incinerator 's caustic heart .	but
0	68581	Her mom , a native of japan , was an eclectic mix of old-world bushido and 1970s hippy nonchalance .	Her alabama-native dad was so mellow , she wondered if he was awake half the time .	and
2	143605	Dont take this the wrong way .	I cant afford to have anything go sideways on us .	but
0	19859	It shook her up .	She was certain it always would .	and
0	93830	I 'll stay in 2 until it falls kill snow , and then die for my trouble .	Go to the capitol .	and
0	142574	Lorena smiled from ear to ear .	Drew my head down toward her .	and
0	119056	Which was very dangerous risky and .	Would require tremendous strength and bravery to make it work .	and
3	131055	With a grimace , she said , `` , i 'll be out of a job so i guess i 'll have to help you . '' .	You get sick and die .	if
0	116314	That you had returned .	Them to come and claim you or repudiate you .	and
2	46221	I felt better because i was cleaner .	I still felt ready to come out of my skin .	but
2	76147	The second sons might not enjoy the shining reputation of the golden company .	They had won some famous victories over the centuries .	but
1	16379	And kim doesnt count .	She wouldnt talk if her toenails were being plucked out .	because
0	132314	A few seconds later , a third car sedately drove up v that the other two vehicles had created .	Parked in the middle of the metal .	and
2	60069	I hesitate and instead he shoves my shoulder with his free hand .	Wait for him to push me with the beretta .	but
0	100070	To take him into the city .	Show him entertaining things - particularly the aforementioned women with low inhibitions .	and
0	75271	She opened the washing machine .	Dropped in her jeans and t-shirt and bra .	and
0	98528	Tavi grabbed a nearby bucket .	Tossed it to foss .	and
3	137027	He knew how bannim would have felt about that .	Even the event did happen before bannim had arrived as superintendent .	if
2	2480	She hated resorting to the internet for information on ali .	She was out of options .	but
4	2534	* * * , one hour later , harry flint hurried from one rental car booth to another .	The kig private jet arrived in madrid .	when
1	58557	Flips completely over in the compacted air , and comes down on top of him .	His electra glide leaves the ground .	because
0	88575	He waved a bejeweled hand at the servants who rushed to clear their plates .	Ari fought down the scowl that was determined to mar her expression .	and
1	137690	You came after me .	My explosion would have killed you all in a matter of minutes .	because
2	135823	That had no other choice .	To sleep in their cars parked in the woods .	but
2	134159	We did a number on charles .	You consistently win , with or without my help , the guys wont invite you .	but
3	156391	Mathison may have picked up the gaff in an attempt to defend himself and struck his intruder .	It was the killer .	if
2	71157	Technically , he only owned a small amount of land .	Isolation made it appear larger .	but
0	135957	He pressed a kiss against my fluttering pulse .	Another gasp escaped me .	and
0	139844	You feed her . '' .	You deal with her .	and
2	89624	Then a thought occurred to her , and .	She paused in her heated defense .	but
2	39436	This is usually my cue to give up the fight .	Damn it , i 'm scared out of my mind something could happen to ivy .	but
2	45872	Jared 's loss had left a small hole in my heart that had been seeping slowly and steadily since his death .	This , this was a hemorrhage .	but
2	157911	He started to correct her .	She 'd realize how wrong she was soon enough once he gained the information he needed .	but
0	16034	The old man unhitched his grey horse .	Slapped it on the flank .	and
0	64082	When they were in his office , he seated her in one of the plastic chairs next to his desk .	Brought her a second glass of water .	and
3	94037	She 'd ask jaenelle to look into it .	Another plant should suffer a sudden demise .	if
0	91362	She was hot irritable , and .	She wanted to cry but her eyes were dry as bone .	and
0	24141	He pointed his wand .	A burst struck the bus stop sign next to beifar .	and
4	79758	He used that same easy glide that chance had .	The man walked toward her .	when
2	107967	The rage always wore down to misery , and .	When misery was unreleased , trapped in by nothingness , it turned to fear , then to rage .	but
2	52109	My line of bowmen fired into their flank .	It was throwing a rock at a swarm of bees .	but
2	110280	I search the first floor , looking for any sign of ethan , gabe , or gilbert .	I see none of them .	but
1	20411	`` but it is not , but because people would naturally be disturbed by it , and the public good must be consulted , '' .	You are a slave that you can not go where you like .	because
3	47275	The job 's yours . '' .	You want it and i 'll let you get away with doing your homework on the side .	if
3	15056	I might have been poorly thought of by the other scholars and might perhaps have lost my position .	I had been forced to stop him by - hurting him .	if
2	99876	I have a few loose ends to wrap up . '' .	I can be ready to go in about an hour .	but
2	28338	I wrote a lot , till i wrote dark lake .	Avoided facing my own darkness .	but
2	45471	Now he ordered her down on her knees and .	Told her to follow him .	but
1	114432	But people carved these words .	They had something they needed to say .	because
2	106585	Had almost beaten the nice out of him .	He had to stop now that shinwoo and the other guys threatened to break up the band .	but
2	87360	She heard a faint ringing from across the corridor both phones rang out .	Roderigo then rang a number on his smart phone ( pity he wasnt , she thought ) and .	but
0	47885	Slowly he made his way to the halls .	Caught the attention of a passing soldier .	and
3	132287	So it cant be daves .	The baby has type b or ab .	if
0	122191	Plot a course to sector 533 , move the fleet .	Wait for my orders .	and
0	97125	Long before , in the bliss of valinor , before melkor was unchained , or lies came between them , fingon had been close in friendship with maedhros .	Though he knew not yet that maedhros had not forgotten him at the burning of the ships , the thought of their ancient friendship stung his heart .	and
0	37498	Angelina was already walking a bit .	She had a few words , although no one could understand them but susannah .	and
0	22670	The dazed and pale scientist could only stammer something about having to clean out his desk , that she should spread the word about a retirement ceremony in the auditorium at 1400 .	Someone had to leave the civil service today to meet mapra limits .	and
3	79879	I cant see anyone inside , in fact i cant see any windows or doors .	Its a helicopter in trouble why is one is calling out for help .	if
0	34755	Then he pulled up a chair directly in front of her .	Sat down in it cheerily , as though they were going to have a cozy chat .	and
3	21474	What do you mean you 'll kill each other ? '' .	You fall in love .	if
3	15520	They have to follow a very bloody and violent interpretation of their creed .	They want to appease their god and keep their lives and freedom .	if
4	60879	Al lurched to get out of my way , his goat-slitted eyes wide .	I threw the unfocused energy at the surface demon instead of him .	when
4	8389	Realization smacked me in the face , weaving her way through my cluttered apartment .	Liz wrinkled her nose in disgust .	when
0	126722	I took the steaming mug .	Noted he 'd doctored it with cream and sugar , just as i liked .	and
0	75707	When the milking was finished .	The women were done with breakfast clean up , they all separated into their groups to begin the planned daily tasks .	and
4	12659	Joshua took the opportunity to slip outside unobserved .	At last silas claimed his daughter for a dance .	when
2	117523	He hated to do this .	He was going to have to go inside the house .	but
2	18809	Right now , few people knew .	It was only a matter of time .	but
2	104514	The voice was muffled .	Nella could understand what was said .	but
3	127790	He could still see it , the fiery orange ball shining on noir .	He closed his eyes .	if
2	63015	The masses still piled up .	The pressure somehow seemed less .	but
0	141225	Just three large black aircraft gained the sky .	Headed for the far horizon .	and
2	36053	This might be the end of his life .	He 'd see that it was well lived .	but
0	29072	Maybe his friends were right , because he wanted to gather her up and comfort her , and put a bullet in her parents ' heads .	Ice water really did flow in his veins .	and
0	8892	At last the shoot ended .	When he returned to the main room , he found claire covered in a white terry robe , thank god .	and
2	146586	Demanding social justicejerusalem was captured many times re-settled .	In this old holy citys streets prophets-poets were walking and shouting about the sins of the israeli kings and other ruling classes and high society richmen , and , and now besieged .	but
2	83345	And we can pretend that there 's someone else out there for us .	We both know , in the end , we 'll come back to each other .	but
0	76486	My friend and i were in a wreck , '' emma said .	Then her voice wobbled a little .	and
0	127938	Maggie was my child .	It mattered a whole hell of a lot .	and
2	26450	The woman behind the counter had to be a hundred and fifty years old if she was a day .	The welcoming smile she showered on arden was as youthful as spring .	but
0	143994	Indal 's knees gave out .	He sat on his cot .	and
2	50910	Youre not bleeding that much .	We can arrange that .	but
0	146646	They entered the city with men-at-arms manned the ramparts .	Seized the duchess 's palace .	and
2	33717	'' she says , and then she adds , `` of course , we 've been divorced for ten . '' .	I 'm wondering if they 're stained .	but
4	144097	Thoughts of him take over her mind .	She should be enjoying this wonderfully decadent afternoon tea .	when
2	68219	As the roots held him fast , he lit the torch .	Instead of the sparkling jewels and hidden treasure nicholas had expected to find , he saw only a cylindrical shaft that fell to gloomy shadows below .	but
2	63098	The bed was probably infested with lice .	It was still a bed .	but
3	98960	All i had to do was ask .	I wanted to stop .	if
3	68061	His older brother was really asking .	Simon had a grip on himself .	if
4	159450	He pulled his fingers out of me and jerked my skirt .	I finally came back down to earth .	when
2	72181	No one would be able to see her .	If the light were to hit her just right , it would catch a luminescent outline of her body .	but
4	44542	What a person will reveal .	They face death on a nightly basis .	when
2	99891	I opened my mouth to say something .	He beat me to it .	but
2	6264	He knew such words were no longer empty boasts .	Would soon be filled with the gaseous insanity of intolerance already sweeping into czechoslovakia and the rest of the eastern european states .	but
4	33438	Expecting kent to wince , grimace , gulp or show some sort of fearful emotion , it caught me off guard .	He started to laugh .	when
0	19655	They both slept in each others arms for eight straight hours .	Then later on , they went to bed holding each other .	and
0	118000	Witichkin the kid with the ears had unsuspectingly grabbed the last tree .	Plunged it into veunics gut .	and
3	119698	The place that held it was .	The present moment was beautiful .	if
0	57564	A fine sheen of sweat covered her drawn face .	Her lips were pressed .	and
0	36532	He introduced himself as sergio .	Had only come to the united states from milan italy at the beginning of the year .	and
3	78983	I might have recognized the similarity .	I 'd ever met a telepathic doodlebugger . '' .	if
2	35571	Receive him elsewhere feeling too weary to make the effort .	She should change first and .	but
4	27181	He recalled a particular time .	He 'd leapt out on a vixen .	when
4	118667	To lift her into his arms .	His too-thick brain finally clicked into gear .	when
0	39381	Simon follows us in .	Turns to survey the interior .	and
2	43521	Harlin looks away like he 's over it .	I can tell he 's still anxious .	but
4	27048	There was hardly enough room left for her to sit .	The chauffeur bundled her into the car to take her home .	when
0	101584	Amelia clicked on google . '' .	Typed in `` pyramid of gizeh hotel .	and
4	64434	Holding on to the steering wheel .	The vehicle bounced over rocks .	when
0	143574	Anyway , we all marched out of cimmura and came on down here to the holy city .	Joined with dregos and obler .	and
3	25388	It always began to fall inside the circle a few seconds after it had started outside , as if the rain was coming from .	It started to rain .	if
2	98087	I wanted to avoid this .	There is no way around it that i can think of .	but
4	95648	It was only later that brine remembered why it was he was reciting the five-hundred and fifty-third chapter of havitt and , as a consequence , pulled down hard on the braid in his hands .	The bole-beast released its breathy cry into the sky .	when
2	52351	The plants need to be watered .	I take time to water them then the weeds start taking over in the other rows .	but
3	85536	But i guess thats the point .	I want to win the election this fall .	if
4	125017	`` for one thing , my nephew was posting guards in the hall at the foot of the stairs .	I retired this eve-undoubtedly to prevent something such as this .	when
0	117894	The silverne king himself was slain .	Even marliuk the eglat was dragged down in ruin .	and
3	25861	She 'd whip around and walk the other way .	She saw him coming .	if
2	113925	Get back to his car and he did have his gun in his briefcase .	He couldnt go to the ranger station for help .	but
0	12431	The man in the tuxedo , who i really didnt recognize , removed lids from the trays of food .	Sat plates full of fancy looking meats and vegetables in front of us on the table .	and
2	11725	He didnt say anything .	Put his arm around her and helped her to the dry spot where he had left the bananas .	but
2	125139	It was pitiful compared to branna .	She 'd been working on it off and on .	but
2	38526	Guess i went a little crazy .	You just it was you had to get .	but
3	23673	A mutual understanding of each other should be encouraged as soon as possible to prevent any possible outbreak of interplanetary war .	An alien race were to be contacted .	if
0	38343	His business was the separation of the wheatgerm of the soul from the chaff of the mortal body .	That was usually concluded long before any of the rites associated with , when you got right down to it , a reverential form of garbage disposal .	and
0	45681	He swung too low the ball skipped up and back off the bat .	His timing was right , but .	and
4	60039	She trains in the rain in or sun in northern california 's winter , i in the snow and freezing rain , almost no sun .	We have to be outside .	when
4	128033	She woke with a start .	The cat hopped off the sofa and left the room .	when
2	29038	If hed let go of the spear , the revenants would have taken it .	That was no matter .	but
3	83888	`` , i 'll be able to keep this garden going all winter .	I can have a little help from my big powerful husband , and his special gift .	if
0	44397	Ryder shoved the thought into thomas 's head .	Knew it would be a compulsion .	and
4	146775	Maybe , it 'll sound wonderful .	I wake up in the morning and kick my ass around a bit .	when
2	42390	Karen backed off as politely as she could , giving a few vague answers before hurrying david .	There was no escape from david .	but
2	148699	Her emerald eyes looked wide .	Her short brown hair was a mess .	but
2	109312	They still had a lot of issues to discuss and decide .	She was confident they could work things out .	but
2	129757	It 's not the right answer .	It 's the truth .	but
0	155766	The two of them were facing each other .	As i watched she went into a trance state , eyes slowly closing .	and
2	79459	Raja wanted to help vinny out of the car .	Refrained , knowing it would offend the tough-guy attitude she maintained about herself .	but
1	116533	I had to wonder just what i 'd done to piss fate off .	She sure seemed intent on throwing curveballs my way .	because
1	105550	Juliet must have sensed it .	She offered a wry look .	because
4	148097	I simply brought those things with me . '' .	I came through the interworld portal .	when
0	72259	Lavina smiled at her lover for a second but her lip quivered .	She began to cry .	and
2	106803	I was prepared to be slapped .	She didnt approach me .	but
1	98001	Something about you getting the job .	You had to leave buffalo .	because
4	151953	Considered the most powerful .	Dealing with beings of the other realm .	when
0	96058	He winked at michael , then turned to walk into the house .	Patted him on the shoulder .	and
2	83769	He placed a hand on the wall beside my head and i went to sidestep .	He placed his other hand on the other side of my head , trapping me .	but
4	1142	It was clean of disease .	Carthinal got back to the camp .	when
2	144459	The girls start chattering about their plans and ideas .	I cant seem to focus on the conversation .	but
0	75699	I will take an opportunity within the next hour of explaining all to you .	You shall form your own kind and generous judgement upon circumstances in which my honour and my happiness are so nearly concerned .	and
3	65253	Youd have noticed them .	You werent so high .	if
3	89921	You could have been seriously hurt .	You 'd been in the house .	if
2	124948	So many objections rose in his mind .	Tien 's smile banished them .	but
1	96110	Maybe kylie 's perception was warped .	She knew they were trespassing-basical y breaking the law .	because
2	130490	He still misses his mother .	He 's still i guess i 'm not completely sure he is-then it 's todd he 's grieving for .	but
2	58455	Singing a karaoke duet was stepping way out of lex 's comfort zone .	He 'd seriously considered doing it , for her .	but
2	123687	Tray , jaysen and reid planned to take turns .	I was hoping you might have an alternative in mind .	but
1	126153	Hed had to stop his work .	We were in his way .	because
2	158546	Connor shrugged and , '' the kids were already running up the beach , leaving the fireworks behind .	Said , `` it 's up to you if you want to find out for yourself .	but
3	143949	Then i would do it .	That meant taking a job in london that made more money .	if
0	15396	After settling down from a stressful day of teaching she decided she should return the call .	When she did the phone rang but no one answered , so it seemed the two were playing phone tag .	and
2	95678	I realized it was crazy .	I still did it .	but
0	157884	As she left , tomaz chuckled .	Pulled his charger back to walk beside the princes horse , which shied away from the huge stallion before calming itself .	and
2	89196	One had been stabbed in the leg .	He did not seem too bothered by it .	but
3	19058	- '' `` rocky - '' `` and i got ta get off .	I do someone else might snatch up the apartment .	if
2	46330	I appreciate what youre saying .	-- - lausauxs voice turned icy .	but
3	4390	The hairdresser and maid will be available to help you . '' .	You 'll be here around five bells .	if
0	98700	Her left hand came .	Delivered a hard , fast hit to his chin .	and
2	109026	Gareth opened his mouth .	Then closed it , stumbling , at a loss for words .	but
2	26315	Who tensed visibly on her bed .	Kept her hands over her face .	but
2	77785	I have no idea what she does with the bodies . '' .	She 's very discreet .	but
0	117203	The reek and chill of the deep black earth were about it .	Its colour was an indeterminable hue which changed with each new angle from which he surveyed it .	and
2	55839	The trio looked at each other in excitement .	Their joy was short-lived .	but
4	30213	The chill finally left connor .	Her arms wrapped around him .	when
0	35428	I saw him take your mother .	Heard her voice in my head telling me it was all as it was meant to be .	and
0	143957	They had been as difficult as the adults .	Said that he wasnt sick at all ; he just had bad dreams sometimes and the nurse was there to wake him up when that happened .	and
2	146207	Aria pulled her hood over her head again and the reporters still descended on them .	Spencer covered her face with her sleeve .	but
2	2712	Then she adds , `` watch out for brooke .	A smug smile creeps across my face , and .	but
2	2888	Well , the bathtub has feet on it . '' .	It looks like modern plumbing .	but
3	16997	Then i 'm sure beck can .	He can see past my mask right into my deepest hurts .	if
3	61543	`` would you mind very much ? '' .	I tried touching you .	if
2	122577	She depressed the syringe .	It jerked out of his arm as he seized .	but
3	69344	That i was interested in-even .	He had already broken my heart back in the fal .	if
2	33847	Focusing on the beast would help her to remember her anger .	Even the beast did not seem so terrifying .	but
4	91734	I 'd just switched out my books .	I turned and crashed into brett .	when
0	54152	It had all been very hot very loud , but .	She 'd joined in the cheer when jeannie had carried rob anybody over a tiny broomstick that had been laid on the floor .	and
0	55093	Let me get another couple of guys .	Then well see what we can do to get your friend out of .	and
0	148766	He was no stranger to hunger .	Neither was his family .	and
4	153606	`` you look tired , '' i finally said .	Jenks made a motion for me to say something .	when
0	109920	Ackturrians are the aggressors in the war .	We lose all the allies in the galaxy .	and
0	111907	She had married eph much too young .	Deferred too much of herself-her own needs , ambitions , desires-helping him advance his medical career .	and
3	147367	I 'd be very surprised .	She turns out to be real .	if
4	60216	My mom was there . '' .	The cops came for me .	when
2	144558	Rudy was soaked head-to-toe in sweat .	The sight of tori in damp jeans and a v-neck t-shirt made him sweat more .	but
2	60070	Richard may have been with them once . '' .	He saw the error of his ways and helped capture mathias .	but
0	152350	Ghleanna shook her head .	Rubbed her fingers against her temples .	and
0	119523	He retrieved the necessary tools and work gloves out of the shed .	Hurried up the small hill to the designated trees .	and
0	44951	Then his eyes opened .	They sliced to abby .	and
0	132761	Cole matched dalton 's pace .	Spoke softly to him .	and
2	59250	Why she would do such a thing , madoc had no idea .	Part of him hoped she 'd succeed .	but
0	77500	He unzipped the leather case .	Took out his backup bow .	and
2	145902	Sylvia herself would have preferred something more like a psychiatrist 's office , with prints of famous paintings and understated wallpaper .	She understood her market and her clientele .	but
4	118679	All the drivers had been out on fares , and that he had only managed to gain the hack he had at an absorbitant fee .	He 'd reached the stables .	when
2	146771	Bianca , the swanmane , is a little unhappy about that , and who could blame her .	It 's not the ardeur that makes her miss j.j. she just liked j. j. .	but
4	74107	I had assumed that he was as nonchalant about all of this as he looked .	The door to my cell opened and he squatted down in front of me .	when
2	91610	I could not help .	Think that things would have been different if i had accepted to go with the morflon from the tau tribe .	but
4	147913	We were within three miles of bargrennan .	Jamie suddenly broke the silence .	when
0	527	It would be night soon , but she could not have stayed with her aunt for another second , could not listen to another word .	The last thing she wanted to do was trek through the roughest part of the great western forest in the dark .	and
4	87589	Maureen found it easy to forget her resolve .	She was with him .	when
0	160231	The only other possible candidate was mateo .	His mind was under enough strain with the burden of the cabot curse .	and
3	47688	Shewondered , and the thought made tears sting hereyes .	They would hate her because of everything that happened .	if
0	64153	I grab a branch , into the wood .	Feel power shoot through my hand .	and
0	97107	Professor lyal hung his hat and coat on a spindly hat stand crowded behind the door .	Took one of the chairs .	and
4	68394	He took himself for some kind of universal genius like leonardo da vinci , that he worked simultaneously on different things , she blinked and said nothing .	I replied that he had more than one string to his bow .	when
0	115737	Laying their eyes on his foot .	Watching him throw a five hundred pound dumpster against the brick wall of a building in a tantrum .	and
2	96376	Some just stopped moving . ' .	Most actually caught fire .	but
2	21683	I opened the door and chuckled .	Glanced over at my unopened copy of less than zero .	but
2	57000	It will not stop them . '' .	It will slow them down .	but
2	99225	Yes , it was a big gun .	There were - as jenks said - nineteen other weapons in the place .	but
0	107187	Sydney sat back against her pillows .	Drew her knees to her chest .	and
1	145249	Although i do talk to them briefly they can tell im not up for conversation , and they dont stay .	I know theyre curious and concerned .	because
2	40017	Soon the novelty wore off , and .	Their perceived arrogance and their ticks and idiosyncrasies gave rise to mocking and criticism .	but
4	20494	He must 've gotten the hint .	She left the table earlier .	when
2	140459	I would have enjoyed having a peer group with a little more gender diversity .	I figured that would change eventually , all in good time .	but
0	40197	If the kid was going to finish off tach , he 'd have to remain material .	Jack could hit him with all the force of a cannon .	and
2	5039	He was a human , so i would tell him no .	At least it stroked my broken ego a little .	but
4	10303	She began to scream happily and beat the top of his crewcut head with the palms of her hands .	He broke into a trot .	when
3	142826	He 'd probably have to tell him that he was a pretty good guy .	He ever ran into judge kragle .	if
0	44909	She leaned back into the chair fingered the little gold star on the side of her nose .	Raised an eyebrow at him .	and
3	81824	Maybe he could still get the help he needed .	He could convince them that he meant no harm .	if
3	101357	It was certainly its ceo .	Anyone had full access to this facility .	if
0	79073	The littles need safety , stability , a home .	You are helping provide that for them .	and
0	61406	Brooke hugged me , slipping me a knowing expression as she got into the car .	Kissed me on the cheek .	and
3	31326	`` and we were wondering . '' .	You could tell us where the glatenfrissle compound is located so we can see it for ourselves .	if
2	101538	Not to be his own counsel .	To hire outside help , which he eventually did .	but
4	150541	He called back over his shoulder .	He was halfway across the deck .	when
2	64352	He grabs a box of cereal out of the cupboard and , sets it down on the table keeps a grip on it .	Consulting the side of it .	but
0	17822	I 'd never been in an elemental duel before .	I had no desire to engage in one now , not when i knew how much stronger sebastian was in his magic than i was .	and
4	103137	Never noticed the moment .	The sun , lightening his path when he crossed the road , sank below the western horizon .	when
0	35550	Swiftly he pulled out from beneath me .	Looked down through the darkness .	and
3	146937	That way to check facebook or send off an email message , they wouldnt accidentally come across it .	Someone used his computer for something .	if
0	111600	At the same time she was still dirty , and felt for the first time since aunt eustacia 's death that she was back in full form .	Mussed from her evening of moving headless corpses with michalas.but she had a task .	and
4	104135	To harbor bad blood .	You can let it go and build a family for jonas .	when
0	55899	Yes oh yes ladies and germs , step .	Behold the first wonder of the modern world .	and
0	151928	So i put on a coat , meaning to walk the palace halls for a bit and perhaps step out for some fresh air .	Stepped out of my room .	and
0	139230	Each breath was strained weak .	To breathe quickly but .	and
1	36480	Which would get him into trouble .	The objective was to keep the convict ahead of you .	because
4	129546	She went into paroxysms of sentiment , hugging each doll and calling it by name , and giving a commentary on each object as she hugged or caressed it .	She reached her own room .	when
0	97549	Marvin woke up about twenty minutes later , his lips a bloody mess .	Started crying softly to himself .	and
0	111846	Flicked on the heat .	Turned it all the way up .	and
0	13416	Barak 's eyes widened in astonishment .	Mandorallen 's face blanched .	and
1	94189	Vestavia is preparing in a defensive manner .	Fra bardaric in the uk is driving this mission .	because
2	79460	The road offered him a clear path , a place to use his pace to its fullest .	It also made him a sitting duck , a target that could not be missed .	but
3	154024	Why would he talk to a complete stranger ? '' .	Lonny clark is not talking to the locals .	if
4	106806	Send him on his way .	And only when , he wished .	when
2	156394	He opened the book before him , propped on the pillow .	Continued to stare at the wall above it .	but
2	140221	Bowe had accepted ; x .	After absently congratulating him that night , he 'd spent an hour huddled in a corner with nandiuml .	but
4	46682	Especially given the way things had begun between them at the frat party .	He 'd been exactly the kind of scum she 'd been trying to evade her entire life .	when
0	70434	Firstly they would become a visible part of the system rather than anonymous wandering minstrels .	Possibly fall foul of the south jefestan authorities .	and
4	98159	She had been a desperate , battered woman with a small child in tow .	She first visited the bryson house .	when
4	42106	Straight away he was digging through the chest .	We returned it to him , checking that his maps and scrolls were .	when
2	111284	She had a good business , he admitted .	He could make it great .	but
3	23527	Fine he can eat the repercussions .	He wants me to do his job .	if
0	49079	Someone locked her in the bathroom of her hospital room .	She actually did not see anything that happen .	and
0	64717	He takes a scalpel and places it in a plastic container with a lid .	Removes a tissue sample from the chest cavity .	and
0	108376	Tugging on the material handing her the shirt he had just removed .	Pulling it over his bare chest .	and
2	36076	Men may whisper of the faceless men of braavos .	We are older than the secret city .	but
0	76589	I talked to the head guy this morning but we have to put in our own guys .	He 's at least coherent .	and
3	94438	`` '' said matilda to the boy , `` i should like to play . '' .	It 's a game .	if
3	68657	To ask longbow or red-beard .	They 'd moved out of zelana 's territory .	if
0	48183	Say what you mean .	Ask for what you want .	and
4	112410	To give her shoulder a consoling pat .	She looked up again and shook her head .	when
2	54912	Ariel thought about asking her parents .	To be honest she was a little annoyed with them .	but
3	88112	What clarices reaction would be .	I walked into the office tomorrow and told her i wanted to see the file for 101 potsdam .	if
0	115491	Ben saw ricks nose implode and blood spray in an arc across his face about a millisecond before the pain from his behind exploded in his brain like a great lightening flash .	He remembered nothing more until he heard the voice of an ambulance man asking , are you .	and
0	97286	Just then his phone rang .	He strolled off down the room .	and
2	111870	I 'm guessing around 140 miles per hour . '' .	That 's as fast as i 'm taking it with you in .	but
4	86519	She was thrilled and terrified at the same time .	Mi received the package she had ordered off the internet .	when
3	106033	Do again three times .	I could keep him .	if
3	132216	What would be needed ( if - was there any doubt .	I successfully landed on the carrier .	if
0	20606	Was she going to tell her mafia uncle to pour cement in my shoes .	Chuck me out in the pacific .	and
3	1821	`` tell me ? '' .	You get strange tingling , okay .	if
3	92930	But perhaps it would be best , dont you think .	We dispensed with the formalities .	if
2	155687	Sammy ran past the man .	Didnt seem to pay any attention to him .	but
4	43089	What would he do .	Joseph came to daycare .	when
1	127063	Something must have gone terribly wrong in the family .	Her next memory was of the day her mother left her on the doorstep of the orphanage , with nothing but a note and the clothes on her back .	because
2	11156	It 's hard to make it out .	A guy was sitting on a stool with a guitar on his lap .	but
0	91340	He would be set upon in the blink of an eye .	Executed there and then by his own people .	and
3	21006	Might we not quell their anger by nominating one of their own ? '' .	Mr. d'arc is correct , and the deprived are planning an uprising .	if
0	83636	`` you want me to allow one of my most dangerous foes to live , you want me to surrender a competent ally .	Then you would like me to permit the erosion of my power base to continue .	and
2	127703	It 's okay , i guess . '' .	I 've never had a sexual encounter that 's been any better than my solo sessions .	but
2	124365	Having just been ripped off .	After we talked awhile she gave me permission to go ahead and look .	but
4	143317	I complained about these clothes .	I was in prison but the computer would not give me anything stylish .	when
0	18697	Jagged , silver blade glinted deathly in the light .	The handle was cold against my skin .	and
3	24483	They can stay ahead of the demonata .	A species learns to move on to other worlds .	if
4	27255	It came out in a gust of air ? '' .	I forced a , `` what .	when
0	46100	The little girl seemed to be about six or .	I knew as soon as i saw her that she was styric .	and
1	150230	I could see both the forest and the lake .	The cabin was on a rise .	because
4	37803	Then , i was .	You tried to explain .	when
3	78704	That sounds like dead .	You want my medical opinion .	if
0	50613	We can challenge her .	If she refuses , she will be forced to relinquish her crown .	and
0	47933	She knows the way we are heading .	Knows the swamps better than us .	and
4	67851	Daemon raised her hand to his lips for a light kiss .	She returned to the bed .	when
1	96035	Even we had kissed .	We were trying to distract our minds from the fear we felt .	because
2	53043	She rarely reacted with anger .	This man had been unsettling her , arousing her and brushing off her opinions for too long .	but
2	13256	Only a few minutes had passed .	The room and its contents no longer were alien .	but
0	108034	Her white eyebrows caught the light against her bronzed forehead .	You could practically see every hair .	and
1	156116	He thinks atlantis is doing the world a favor by taking over mantineia and reorganizing the troubled land .	The kyrenian emperor does not agree with how nextear has gained power .	because
2	141455	Could not help smile .	Heather but shook her head and .	but
2	46084	I had a conference with therr .	He said to wait .	but
1	89177	You could handle it .	I was trying to be supportive .	because
4	44580	She noticed streaks of gray in his hair that had escaped her notice .	Simon eventually looked up .	when
0	156915	The fragments , all jagged and red-hot , sprayed the groveling eunuchs .	They all immediately stopped being bored .	and
3	140402	Not for the first time , she wondered .	Something was wrong with her .	if
2	23145	Had fun with you , for a time i even needed you .	It would never have worked out between us .	but
4	33519	@ athere was no great danger in the harbour of trincomalee .	You made your first deal with the english dog o'neill , forty good men went to the bottom that day .	when
0	87336	Light had spilled out .	I heard the thump of a hammer being set down .	and
0	84619	Eric 's maker being in town .	Him being scarier than freddy krueger .	and
3	145939	You 'll draw a crowd .	You create a disturbance .	if
1	50540	She 'll want to get pregnant .	She thinks it 's what i need to feel better .	because
2	24148	I almost fell out of my chair i had a feeling that people were watching my reaction .	My mouth went dry and .	but
1	34647	And then i wanted to bring you some flowers .	Your room seemed a little bare .	because
0	76858	He walked over to a small wooden set of bleachers .	He sat down on them to watch them play .	and
4	39744	She collapsed against his chest .	They both came down from the clouds .	when
2	148796	I tried to question him .	He was already gone .	but
0	81509	Have a word with the mate , show him some of your arrows .	He 'll get some in before we sail .	and
2	78019	I understand your fascination . '' .	She 's not available .	but
0	7034	I saw the registry in agana .	All it had were names and the current date .	and
0	69074	The protector glanced at her feet .	She saw him start to smile .	and
0	115417	Still she was apprehensive about coming into the open .	Felt naked thus exposed .	and
0	34788	The wind outside the plane began whipping inside .	Created a loud roar .	and
4	125852	Your options are limited .	You 're named for an aunt who died much too young .	when
0	63092	Sebastian blew cool air across his hot skin .	Frowned as a round geometric design appeared in his palm .	and
3	134175	Any atrocity , any evil , is justified .	It keeps you from leaving me .	if
4	147927	The reporters flew into the sky .	The da said jump .	when
3	47188	Nothing would stop him from closing on it .	This were a business deal .	if
2	42544	I jump off the bed , holding my stomach , and backing toward the wall .	My head pounds and the room spins .	but
0	150138	Usually sort of thing is bordering on catatonia .	Thats a whole different ball game .	and
2	96323	Attacking all at once will bring him .	One of them will still get tagged .	but
0	73173	A second story was added around the turn of the century .	Two more bedrooms and a walk-in attic are upstairs , but i seldom go .	and
3	113230	Clearly , there is something special about ysenof .	He can have burning oil explode in his face and not get burned .	if
3	46547	After a guy has been out of work for a long time he might be inclined to let the kid take it . '' .	His kid gets offered a job .	if
0	135535	Best not forget that someone out there thought he was dangerous enough to imprison him in an ancient mayan pool , and .	I had just freed him .	and
2	150595	I was so surprised .	Then it kept going .	but
0	155090	Jawids dark features stood out against his pale skin .	He had the thin , wiry build of his afghan heritage .	and
0	7354	A tree branch swung down , denting the shape of his porkpie hat .	Struck lorcan across the top of his head .	and
4	89676	But , she and i are devastated .	It finally happens , in 1970 .	when
0	151138	In a few moments , they were walking again toward the parking lot .	I could hear the engine of the car whose gunmen would miss marcone and kill the little girl as it approached .	and
4	66490	I almost gasped out loud .	I saw luke standing in front of her .	when
4	36688	Is this what phoebe had meant .	She said that maisie would always be with me .	when
3	112385	They can carry a few bags .	They arent too heavy .	if
4	151677	You may take critical samples of it with you .	You return to your normal time .	when
4	138203	We had traveled no more than five or six miles on highway 50 .	The police radio crackled and goldie reached over to turn it up .	when
3	1505	So could they , by following my trail .	I could find my way .	if
0	137183	My dads face turned beet red .	He grabbed my arm to stop my exit .	and
0	135180	He stepped away from her .	Climbed onto the next-highest beam .	and
2	78198	It was another hot day .	Mercifully the humidity had dropped slightly making it less clammy .	but
0	30613	Tabetha fell from her horse .	Landed on the hard ground with a thud .	and
0	154499	The young moon was glimmering in a misty sky , but the stars were veiled .	It gave small light .	and
0	3942	To scour through the records .	Keep track of all the purchases and inventory over the years .	and
0	147439	However , i do agree this matter requires immediate attention .	If you do not think you can teach him , i will be forced to allow xanderick to handle it his way .	and
3	148105	My god , tommy then the forward hold could only contain the ammunition and explosives .	The guns are all crated up in the aft cargo hold .	if
2	113228	Who not only spoke for carlos .	Was also empowered to set in motion three killers on the hunt .	but
3	68630	All of the workers would have fled the mansion the second sebastian had started to unleash his stone magic throughout the structure .	They 'd been smart .	if
0	62597	He 'd had to explain his role as a belador the last time he 'd tracked her down in canada .	Had been forced to tap local belador resources to get her out of that country .	and
3	79287	Leave a message for me .	You pass through bree .	if
3	85855	Simultaneously outing myself as an alcoholic .	I wasnt careful , i would prove my innocence of sexual impropriety .	if
0	108747	She could not speak , but tried to give her a reassuring smile .	Tasha knew her mother was frightened for her .	and
2	92298	The doctor moved her to a private room .	He wanted to keep her in the hospital for the remainder of her pregnancy , to make sure she was safe .	but
3	34086	Both , `` , lovely ladies , i 've gotten a business call just now that i must attend to .	You 'll excuse me .	if
2	108403	Thinking of hope brought him a twisted sense of hope , and .	He felt that he might yet seize his moment .	but
0	80283	A few minutes later , jo-jo dropped her hand .	The feel of her air magic faded .	and
0	88283	Atom and wolf came walking over .	Looking at them sue thought it would be easily possible for atom to ride wolf , he was only just a bit taller .	and
2	40659	Both of them would be unhappy at this .	Their love would remain alive and sacred .	but
0	35963	A nightstand was next to him .	It laid several bowls and rags .	and
2	8745	Locke and coop , sure they could do it .	I can do it better .	but
2	99701	That were always a bit tattered .	Now looked positively uninhabitable .	but
2	65876	Her mistress needed sustenance , as bessie had told their captors after the nasty man had gone back into the inn .	They had ignored her pleas even for water .	but
4	47257	My father had locked my mother in her room .	Her fits became too uncontrollable for him to handle and too embarrassing to stomach .	when
4	123448	Willa took her courage in hand , settled on the edge of the bed and opened the scroll .	Her old friend nodded .	when
4	13332	As the huandrin empire flourished , its culture evolved .	Especially it conquered the grigoy , a people of outstanding intellectual and artistic accomplishments , who soon became the cultural leaders and mid-level administrators of the empire .	when
2	119829	His parents were okay .	The truth was he was too scared to find out .	but
4	114051	She got a look at just how much trouble they were in .	She peered around the corner .	when
4	139534	Mick nodded , and they swam slowly on a lateral curve .	Turok pointed sideways towards the wall .	when
0	91414	The silver is reacting to it . '' .	Forcing it to flee his system .	and
2	156262	The rotten , presumptuous little boy would probably never view this revision of his revision .	How nice it was to imagine his reaction to it if he did .	but
2	8752	You know we have to let him think im falling for him .	Ill keep it strictly g-rated .	but
3	48905	We could find carrie 's full name and address , track down her adoptive or surrogate or whatever-you-call-them parents , and see if we could locate her that way .	We could locate their records .	if
2	44720	At least i can make it through the door and .	Die outside , where the air is fresh .	but
1	140902	The screams to start .	It would mean she was alive .	because
4	56299	Glancing around , he tensed .	He spotted remy sitting at a table along the side , surrounded by girls .	when
0	82038	Then slowly came toward her .	Placed strong , calm hands on her shoulders .	and
0	153062	Therefore , i must beg your kind indulgence .	Ask you not to insist upon seeing me in my present deteriorating condition .	and
1	18994	I can almost see the word , interrobang and all , floating up from my lips in unspoken fervor .	He 's the only person i know who can appear seriously put out with no expression at all on his face .	because
0	9214	Then she spotted dog cookies .	Picked up boxes of beef flavor and chicken flavor .	and
1	116620	Just make sure it 's the right head . '' .	From where i 'm sitting , the only reason you 'd tell her the truth would be to get into her pants .	because
0	108949	Filling the hold with his treasures .	Finding his crew among the barbary pirates .	and
0	57731	Just the front wheels hit .	The vehicle went airborne .	and
2	81493	Had i never given head .	I 'd never been on the receiving end either .	but
4	36134	It felt perfectly natural to instead lean in and press my lips to his .	I turned to share this little bit of nonsense with lucas .	when
3	75884	But id still feel a whole lot better about things .	I had donald pleasence bleeped-off and standing next to me with a machine gun .	if
2	76941	He screamed as his weight shifted to his injured ankle .	It was the sudden presence of his own pistol nuzzled behind his ear that really made his amber eyes go wild with panic .	but
1	11106	I find out you 're lying .	I 'll be the one taking the swings . '' .	because
0	11887	Han nodded to himself .	Stripped off the headset .	and
1	78566	That was completely lost on pax .	Selby sidled up to the bar between him and the woman seated on his other side .	because
0	110226	Now youre probably thinking good riddance , but .	Isnt it a pity that poor charles has lost his best friend .	and
2	116873	Pain shoots through my body .	It only ratchets up my need .	but
0	134033	What you all were like .	He picked the colours .	and
0	49832	He turned towards the table .	Opened the small case theyd brought with them .	and
4	115602	The soldiers must have taken it .	They searched the keep and found calys .	when
2	62321	Lea was tired , her mind screaming for a rest .	She refused to do it and she was ready to continue .	but
0	9876	On the other hand , bertie and byron had been steadfast true since the beginning , and , protecting what needed tending to .	Now , in this moment of crisis with nigel gone , they were behind the walls of the manse .	and
0	8044	He 'd given bubba a magazine to look at and a bottle of life support to sip on .	Began to poke around behind the bar .	and
4	54389	David was at his new london flat .	Matthew next caught up with him , by telephone .	when
0	159036	Certainly no-one normally was suddenly stretched to about twelve feet tall .	Then snapped back into shape so fast that their boots ended up under their chin .	and
2	98825	I told myself these things .	I was deeply troubled by calvin 's decision .	but
2	80088	The difference between three-fourths and two-thirds may not sound like .	It is substantial-and , as i have said , measured by volume , and not surface area , inferno 's oceans are much smaller than earth 's .	but
4	106179	He almost didnt recognize hannah .	She stepped out of the car .	when
2	1507	Startled , she tried to shy away from that sensation .	He held her fast and rubbed the spot with an accuracy that left her in ruins .	but
0	131002	More than ten stepped .	The smith picked his four .	and
3	95565	Alice would spend the night with me .	I was pathetic enough to ask her to .	if
0	78795	Bringing firewood from the wooded lands below .	Before long hundreds of fires lit up the valley in the early evening .	and
0	160530	He 'd had to submerge his loathing and disgust .	Some days it was all he could do not to explode .	and
2	132371	They were trained men .	Never hit a lethal mark .	but
2	43432	He repeated after me .	His was a question .	but
3	133177	There was no way it would understand words .	The child was wild .	if
0	46548	He spent the time recovering from his injuries .	Forcing himself through awkward exercises to maintain his strength it would do no good for the order to present him with an opportunity if he did not have the strength to act upon it .	and
2	38855	She had used the help of the blue moon to try and identify the person attacking her , to find out who it was or at least scare them .	Everything had been in vain .	but
0	136269	To steal the item .	Leave clear evidence that you committed the theft .	and
3	12139	Men like bauer , rich and powerful .	Seldom ever paid for their crimes -- - especially since those who could have condemned them were already dead .	if
4	10021	`` you told me .	I asked about your name years .	when
2	97060	`` mrs. stanhope began she never finished the sentence , because at that moment charles came into the room .	How in this day and .	but
0	59550	He 'd offered me help , hoping to gain access to our territory . '' .	When i 'd refused ... `` you could die , bryn .	and
2	97885	Everything about the three of them being .	When they double-teamed her like this , focused entirely on her pleasure , well , it reminded her of how lucky she was .	but
2	54670	The cops seem good-natured about our setting my blanket down on busy corners and doing our thing .	They usually run us off after an hour , even as they stand around listening for free , chomping on snack food .	but
0	149806	Ysabell was now a faint glow .	He could feel every footstep as it vibrated down the ladder .	and
2	26380	It was incomplete , based on a lot of innuendo and assumptions .	She needed to follow up .	but
2	4960	Never before had i wanted to feel the touch of a man 's lips on me .	He never made a move .	but
2	5789	I want to be sure he believes the lie , that im a believable liar , the set of his arms , the sadness covering his face , he knows im lying .	I can tell from the look in his eyes .	but
4	142474	I rounded this ball .	It first arose from arbol .	when
0	139977	For a moment , there was a pause .	Then chase 's voice went very dry in my mind .	and
0	48266	Their contract sorceress femagick was screaming lawsuit .	Threatening to go to the media .	and
0	49987	Wind was blowing both through the open window .	Vimes was forced to shut it .	and
0	142543	He removed the loop .	Coiled the reata as he returned to clint .	and
0	81408	She could hardly confess the direction of her thoughts .	She could feel her cheeks warm up .	and
4	3948	Why dont you come .	Youve grown some boobs .	when
4	132284	The were had wounded regan .	She was at her most vulnerable .	when
2	31171	She 'd been in mr. coagulate 's class .	She had no scratches .	but
3	79897	Does it hurt to imagine it .	It turns out not to be true .	if
2	41961	Channie said , i dont know how much you know .	My daddy is in a bit of trouble .	but
4	142809	She died and flew straight up to heaven .	Ms morales told her what abraham lefkowitz indiscretion might be worth .	when
2	124624	He recognized the one in the trucker cap ramon from giovannis landscaping crew .	The other two were strangers .	but
2	3356	It had been a bloody , ugly war for the last two months .	Izzy hoped an end was near because she believed she was finally getting her chance at the ogre leader .	but
4	70889	A very serious dilemma arose .	We clambered on board g .	when
1	116481	It would make no difference if he would have .	The chamber was empty .	because
4	143963	So you 'll be nice and plump .	You joust before her grace .	when
0	14379	Ryder held tight to sabine .	Made his way from the wreckage and the hell .	and
0	26739	I just came upon you .	Happened to overhear your thoughts .	and
4	33273	Yesterday , still smeared with dirt and the darkening stains of bass 's blood .	They carried bass in here and sent for the doctor .	when
0	142783	Valiant stopped short near the dark passage .	Fell back , to race up the hill .	and
2	94768	I was going to say something sassy about calories and dancing . '' .	Instead i just said , `` you 're the boss .	but
2	62351	She had skipped dinner last night .	How did he know that .	but
2	154531	Then crept into labadee with everyone on edge .	There was no movement on shore .	but
0	140192	She was alone in a bedchamber with a strange man , half naked .	While her mind was telling her to be terrified , her body was shivering as if she were wracked with fever .	and
2	138280	As soon as he had the case in hand , he parted his lips to dismiss her .	She merely said , `` get some rest , '' and left .	but
4	150161	Her hand hesitated on the doorknob before she turned back to us .	She got to the door .	when
3	67737	It 'd be nice to know how long devyn had had to find her .	She was going to be arrested .	if
0	160614	In those days there was joy beneath the new sun and moon ; but still the shadow brooded in the north .	All the land was glad .	and
3	127108	We will pay you a fair price for it . ' .	You can prove ownership .	if
0	99454	He learned swordsmanship and knife skills .	Was taught how to kill with hands and feet .	and
0	85385	He reached the first of the houses of the village .	Then turned all the way back around , gazing off into the wood .	and
3	19009	They might change their guess to seventy .	They stared into her startling gray eyes .	if
2	41354	I know , '' islena replied , `` .	Grodeg wants to twist it until it comes out that way .	but
2	131461	Is a vague recollection , like deja vu .	No one will really recognize me .	but
2	107173	The three men lunged for horeft .	Were immediately stopped by the knights .	but
2	85797	Thorn had no idea if he went by the name .	He thought it leant familiarity and perhaps a touch of integrity to his ad-libbed cover story .	but
4	89277	A good captain can tell .	Her ships engines are running at optimal performance .	when
2	51792	He owes me something for standing up to papa .	Still wanting to cuss me .	but
3	73009	He couldnt outrun a car with george pulling the old cart .	This was the revenue he was in trouble .	if
2	122955	After getting some of my memories back , i started feeling little tendrils that led to more .	I couldnt connect them .	but
0	7090	He has a talent for his job .	He 's doing reasonably well considering what he 's up against .	and
3	53671	She was trying to make a plan about how to get darcy to herself in such a crowded place .	She ever decided to show up that was .	if
0	155118	Still smiling , she took the glass from his hand .	Tossed it into the fireplace .	and
4	23981	There had been several occasions .	Betts stomach , like a stray at the door , had growled loudly , but her mind had refused entry to any kind of food .	when
2	37250	Normally such protection would be seen as overkill or tawdry fee generation .	When the client is very young , very vulnerable or under threat , it was occasionally necessary .	but
2	19948	They confirmed that the railroad tracks behind the house were not only not in use .	Were actually torn up at both ends about a mile in each direction from my house .	but
0	78552	Shardwyn smiled at breslin .	Tapped his right ear .	and
1	43131	There will be such need in the coming years and decades . '' .	Who knows all the evil that greaves has orchestrated during these years .	because
2	44564	I had a bit of a rough start getting the tiller running .	All in all , it went .	but
2	38926	She wished she could find the anger that had fueled her for so many years .	It was just gone .	but
0	62047	He was sure that she would .	He 'd be ready .	and
4	74778	Kevin stopped his musings .	He heard a loud whooping coming from the direction of the beach .	when
3	87105	Though , what motive would ramsey have to harm him .	Wayne was right about brett 's financial situation .	if
2	107353	There are organizations , like starlin , that have built empires around trafficking .	Everyone knows i disapprove of slavers of any kind .	but
0	42300	The voice had startled them .	They needed no further command .	and
2	573	I thought when he was missed at first that he must have been wounded or killed in the scrimmage .	A thorough search of the area failed to turn him up .	but
0	58892	She was getting him out of the line of fire .	Instead , she 'd handed him over to her enemies .	and
0	4063	Her calm facade would crack .	Then she would explode .	and
4	141298	Uttered a little cry for god .	He saw that the nolan had missing whites of the eye .	when
4	143852	My knee touched his .	I turned to face him .	when
2	135668	You may be the student .	I hold the keys .	but
2	981	The doctor is here with him .	He needs to leave .	but
0	45006	Lee would 've been fourteen at the time .	The guy looking back at me with kelly was certainly not that young .	and
0	112196	Bones growled the words .	I felt the power roll off him with each syllable .	and
0	75364	My body went into spasms of ecstasy over the faux-sugar rush .	It was all i could do not to chug the entire thing in one long gulp .	and
0	119251	Demandred 's trollocs controlled the entire corridor between the heights and bogs .	Were wearing down the defenders at the dry river .	and
0	127326	My bad arm made horseback riding a lot more complicated and scary than it would have been on a good day .	I was no horsewoman .	and
4	19726	I will have his water .	- '' `` you 'll have nothing but empty sand if you continue playing the fool .	when
0	58068	He licked his chops .	Said , `` it is very crunchy , but i like it well enough , '' then startled them and himself by belching .	and
0	83496	The hatred from the main continent is still strong .	I can do nothing about that .	and
2	121018	All too soon there came a chiming sound from a doorbell that ethan hadnt noticed .	Storm-shadow got up and moved to the entrance .	but
2	90238	Trying to gore him with its antlers .	Xelind leaped out of the way .	but
2	24823	Lexie lies in a bed .	To say she lies is dead wrong .	but
2	72306	Anna knew she had it pretty good compared to most kids .	Her project at the griffith observatory meant more to her than almost anything .	but
4	106089	Her left hand vanished into thin air .	She reached for the faucet .	when
0	29167	Now you have forever . '' .	It 's just you and your duty .	and
1	920	His movement must have alerted grandma margie .	She got to her feet .	because
2	146353	Normally , thats not a bad thing .	Chris is in his early 20s and he is doing things that bob is far too young to engage in .	but
4	73884	I was finishing my drink .	I saw ed through the glass door .	when
3	145579	They might prove more loyal to you than to him .	It came down to it , even though you were at the time confined below in the wolverine 's brig ... or so we thought .	if
3	81578	Like they might touch in the middle and turn the alley into a tunnel .	Given a proper shove .	if
2	114642	If we leave now , i would still be yelled at for arriving .	I leave any later i would probably face more serious punishment .	but
0	8401	She would be gone for no more than a few days .	Corozon would be sure to return his love in perfect form .	and
4	96531	I wanted to hop on a plane . '' .	I leave here i could set the destination for anywhere in the world .	when
2	119508	You were born a male .	Lately you have been changing to a female .	but
1	160816	We did not shun our neighbours , for we all lived close together in the town .	They belonged to a different party .	because
4	27012	She had been a few months .	She 'd barely been clinging to life .	when
4	61386	I lied to you .	You were unconscious for the few days after aaron had taken you .	when
2	54124	He started to say something .	Then coughed and fell .	but
0	76433	`` oh , '' i shook my head .	Walked ahead of silas .	and
0	136427	Then , just when i am certain it is too late , the duchess 's party splits in two .	A paltry dozen of the duchess 's men turn their mounts to meet the coming onslaught .	and
3	7023	But who can say what will happen .	On halloween the barrier that protects our world is weaker .	if
0	139541	He took a small handful of white powder from the bag .	Blew it into the air , directly in the space between the two columns of writing .	and
0	26603	She was pretty to me as always shy with her veil drawn over most of her face , and clearly so happy that we were here at last and .	She looked up as i did to the temple .	and
2	80303	Chuck barely noticed nunez arrive with coffee .	Consumed half a pot of the rich brown blend of arabica and robusta .	but
4	9733	It was dark inside , but the television was still on .	She opened the door .	when
2	137641	I knew today was going to be bad .	I had no idea how bad .	but
2	40732	I wanted to introduce myself to the other family members .	Ellie led me up the staircase .	but
2	7663	I know youre a palomino , he added with a note of apology .	Dusty rose was my horse growing up and she was a fine horse so it really is a compliment .	but
0	133615	A crashing back in the willows .	Silk suddenly ran into the circle of firelight .	and
4	155785	A wall of invisibility blocked their path .	Just gisbo had tried .	when
0	133691	Wincing with the pain , now giving me an eyeful of the closest thing to male perfection that i was probably ever going to see .	Dropping it on the ground .	and
2	64668	Our little show , full of dedicated artisans , went well in the innocent green countryside of merry england .	Lacked a certain spark to appeal to a more cynical metropolitan audience .	but
3	99313	House belonged to him , and .	She was still living there ... well , that would change .	if
3	21809	Then that means you can trust me .	He gave me your number .	if
0	64155	Brody reluctantly turned from kate .	Looked at her sister .	and
4	156973	She forced herself to lift her head and step .	She realized that she actually was dozing off .	when
1	43393	I wanted to buy a belt , my pants awkward .	Id been dropping weight the last several weeks .	because
4	146354	Me sneaking off to take a shower .	He was on a work-related phone call .	when
2	156979	His features were fixed .	It swiftly became clear he was out of his depth .	but
0	55136	The boy tore a fist-sized chunk off one end of the loaf .	Handed it to jaime .	and
2	149582	It seemed f**ked up to explain .	They were the two people that i never wanted to lose .	but
2	80964	Her english was perfect held a hint of her accent .	Her voice was still weak , and .	but
4	76027	Juliet did not protest .	He carried her hand to his face and laid it against the angry red flesh of his cheek .	when
2	123064	Beta was very still very distressed by sir georges murder .	She held on to my hand tightly and said nothing .	but
4	926	He half expected to find another pile of invoices , but there was nothing other than two e-mails in his inbox .	He finally returned to his office .	when
0	75162	She sank to her knees .	Stared at the stake hanging from her chest .	and
3	153358	I am not imagining things . '' .	That 's what you were going to say .	if
0	45359	A sidhe noble who refuses challenge , for whatever reason , is branded a coward . '' .	Cowards can not rule at either court .	and
0	116880	The next morning barbara knocked .	Called through the girls door .	and
3	112349	It 's going to be him .	I 'm going to kill anyone tonight .	if
2	105696	`` mrs. vanderwal , i 'm sorry to disturb you . '' .	There 's a gentleman here saying he 's a cousin of yours .	but
2	116395	Nobody knows exactly what i mean .	They will know its no idle boast .	but
0	32117	Then he turned her .	Stared into her eyes .	and
0	127955	The last drops of the thundershower had hardly ceased falling when the pedestrian stuffed his map into his pocket stepped out from the shelter of a large chestnut tree into the middle of the road .	Settled his pack more comfortably on his tired shoulders .	and
1	108875	Had them go out and kill some people .	He wanted to start a revolution .	because
2	145265	Why i feel such closeness with michael .	I do know that i cant stand the sight of him .	but
0	61738	Matthew came out from his room .	Peeped through the balcony railings while stephanie came up behind nora and stared at the uniformed people .	and
2	94755	If you 're gon na shoot me , shoot me ! '' .	I 'll be goddamned if you 're gon na throw me in a hole and leave me .	but
0	144740	She opens up a window .	Drags it over to where we can all see it on the big screen .	and
0	141786	He pulled away a transparent book .	Opened it up to the page with the envelope .	and
2	135576	It was hard for me to imagine .	Obviously , she 'd married him for some reason .	but
4	77505	I 'd rather go flick colt 's hat off his head and keeping it warm .	Josie 's body was beneath mine .	when
2	40416	He tried to brush them off .	It hurt too much to bend over .	but
3	153458	Give us a call and we 'll make sure you get the royal service , for a fraction of the cost .	You decide to do that .	if
2	42174	Usual y , they were refined in their reactions .	Kil ing one of them was , as a rule , not considered polite , and they might behave .	but
2	134468	In its place sat a hard knot of dread .	It was muted like everything else seemed to be .	but
2	59273	His tough , spawn-of-hell image had taken a fatal blow .	At least he would be warm .	but
2	88432	He moves , trying to drive into me .	I twist away and shake my head .	but
2	18238	The baby had quieted , still speaking , but much more quietly , hardly more than a murmur .	I could hear jamie 's voice in the hall .	but
0	141324	Last night the moon was full . ' .	In the morning i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark .	and
2	109937	And i know shes written online that i drove her into preterm labor when i had security throw her out of my office .	She didnt really leave me any choice when she burst in like a crazy woman , screaming threats at me .	but
2	21326	The orange sweater was rather snug .	Eventually it pushed on over his head then his stubby legs .	but
2	158656	I know she 's enjoying dating your jason .	Yes , she 's a spy .	but
4	139678	His fingers had nearly reached her breast .	She finally found the courage to swat his hand .	when
0	128093	Sneak into the people 's territory , while hugh has every vampire in atlanta looking for anything with a tail or a saber then hightail it over to the warren .	Find a wererat who wanted to stay hidden , which was pretty much impossible .	and
2	66676	Preston 's words were meant to break the silence .	It only made marcus 's eyes flare up .	but
2	44974	Traverse the hill and out of danger get .	Get out of the fall line .	but
0	133732	The computer had generated a very detailed image that could be rotated , color enhanced .	Focused to specific sections of the big cetaceans ' body .	and
0	38945	Where they 're sleeping during the day .	Kill them while they 're vulnerable .	and
4	26111	He was a second from kissing me , dragon breath and all .	There was a pounding at the door .	when
4	108375	He dropped the phone into the cradle and went into the kitchen , noting how rapidly the light was fading out of the sky and reminding himself to close the upstairs windows if it started to rain .	It started to rain , judging from the way things looked .	when
0	10038	Her gaze rolled around .	She blinked several times , as if she were fighting to stay conscious .	and
4	48521	Why she was in the tennis court .	The commotion started over at the houses .	when
3	9489	This we will do .	We must take one captive and make them suffer to give us the information we seek .	if
3	83574	You can handle the truth .	Even it hit you square in the face .	if
0	14535	Rachael could not wait to get into the office for full details .	Peter would visit his contacts in the operations center .	and
0	33240	It 's getting later , so just know the clientele is going to change . '' .	It 's going to get wilder .	and
0	58324	He needed to get a grip .	That was going to take time .	and
2	66729	Natalie raised her head .	Met my gaze with a boldness that never failed to make me burn for her .	but
2	46072	You could have saved me .	You ran like a coward .	but
4	22552	I wanted to raise them .	I did have kids .	when
2	37485	You know they said you was high-class ... ... `` it was a duel .	That was just a lie .	but
0	31533	Sucking soda through a straw .	Remembering the kind of pikers the kennedy family originated from .	and
2	99170	The banter mightve continued .	A sudden ringing of the cellphone mark had given kip shifted his attention back to their present circumstance .	but
3	157764	And , whitney had to know .	These men knew it was dangerous .	if
0	83086	She wanted to keep the thermos in complete control .	That meant both hands .	and
2	13087	I never did do that autobiography in english class .	Mrs holt still continued to smile .	but
2	55921	At first i thought peter could serve as my escort .	He is too involved in his own pursuits .	but
2	149654	It was not the filipino way .	He knew there was something brewing .	but
2	22802	I tried to lift her shirt off her .	It was stuck as well , causing her to cry out and start sobbing .	but
2	77137	I was searching for a collection of ancient texts .	Time can be cruel .	but
2	50199	When one gets there the result is unrewarding .	The process is instructive and entertaining .	but
0	3025	They had plenty of sheep .	Should therefore have wool to spare .	and
1	77817	Just saying strange , but because i was sitting at a table , getting ready to eat .	I was sitting at the table with two witches , a vampire , and a keeper .	because
0	64362	She died , speaking with her san francisco lawyers about it by phone .	Faxing several signed documents to them , one of which had been witnessed by felice , confirming her verbal instructions that the house should go to reuben golding .	and
0	64825	Without a word , he silently walked up behind her .	Slid his arms around her waist .	and
3	37626	If i would feel the same as the fae around the table seemed .	To i were in their position .	if
0	127478	I sat down next to my headstone .	Flopped back on the hard soil and grass .	and
0	139120	I had to get out , while endym was distracted .	I had to take my opportunity .	and
2	50073	`` they may look small and dainty . '' .	You could break boulders with those suckers .	but
2	75814	Waving toward the free chairs .	Keeping his hand firmly on top of mine .	but
2	123069	He knew he would have to swallow the bullet to make sure he didnt simply wound himself .	He had a suspicion he would not be able to actually go through with this .	but
3	98922	Made even bigger by the ridge of fur standing along its back and wide , gaping jaws locked into a grimace .	Not for the mark over its eye , she would never have connected him to this massive wolf .	if
4	72261	She looked up regretfully at the top of the slide .	The group of men came pouring through the gate .	when
0	43714	He reached for hades .	Ruffled the fur behind his ear .	and
0	147220	Apparently , they had some kind of big fight when they were younger .	Your dad took off .	and
2	79521	He might turn in test papers that were utterly blank-or blank except for a large , decorative question-mark-and mrs douglas had discovered it was best to keep him away from the girls because of his roman hands and russian fingers .	He was quiet , so quiet that there were times when he might have been taken for a big lump of clay that had been crudely fashioned to look like a boy .	but
2	149241	Myrnin was going to arrange that .	We 've got no way to get them out of bishop 's control .	but
2	117451	He chose to stand back at the window .	This time the scenery was a lot more interesting inside his place .	but
0	116100	He raised his hand .	Focused a bright light of energy from his palm in the direction of silver .	and
2	119629	He was a leg man .	He intentionally checked out her chest .	but
2	60676	And would turn into a juvenile creep and an adult one .	That is a digression .	but
3	2945	`` , and their leader is from harvard , i cant see how they would do something so despicable , even if they do claim to be the meanest gang around . '' .	They 're so polite and respected .	if
2	142661	There was a lot to worry about , a lot to think about for both of us .	Together it seemed like we could conquer it all .	but
2	58917	It was a bold move .	Not one that i felt like dealing with at the moment , so i shoved him off of me .	but
0	132749	He complimented the food .	He helped do the dishes .	and
4	119211	To slip the hand under her blouse .	He found that he was holding a naked breast , with an erect nipple between his finger and thumb .	when
2	137172	Isak answered to no one and he only called in those favors for something significant .	Had his own ties higher up .	but
0	58956	You only get more water into your lungs you can even hear the river laughing about you .	You try to catch breath , but .	and
2	145853	I dont know , he answered before he looked at her .	I think your father does .	but
2	24150	She looked at me .	I intervened before she could say anything .	but
0	134221	He pulled it out .	Jordan told him to bring it over .	and
0	138706	Jimmy finally came out of the bathroom .	Got back in the truck .	and
0	105847	To head to the tallest mountains .	Create a sanctuary in the clouds .	and
0	45914	You knew what the minions were capable of .	I bet you wanted me as far away from them as you could get me .	and
2	27389	The tape has been altered . '' .	It was still possible to extract an image that shows who the person with cheryl austin was .	but
0	154058	His eyes are kind encourage her .	... she stops , a little embarrassed to ask what has come to her mind , but .	and
0	82684	Jack slid down the wing .	Came over to sit by george .	and
2	88889	I began plotting ways to get around it i couldnt figure it out , aside from laying everything down on the table and being straight with her , but .	That would almost surely lead to rejection .	but
3	149590	Do you really believe we will be exonerated .	By some remote chance we live past tomorrow .	if
4	76045	How big it is .	I 'm turned on .	when
3	22891	It was that it really liked this cooper character .	Her body told her anything .	if
2	111217	Victarion raised his axe and , to open the boy from neck to groin serry spun .	Put all his weight behind his cut .	but
4	49701	Thus , even though i 've never been into playing video games , she can beat me at one , i take it .	My wife , donna , claims .	when
3	24379	He was not exactly sure .	He wanted to replace all his downtowner servants , but if all other well-respected lords and ladies were than he didnt want to be late to the game .	if
4	15522	`` i wished that my hand would work again , '' i tell him .	He climbs in after me .	when
2	62210	When he tried to deepen it , i pulled away and .	Rolled onto my back .	but
2	151978	Frightens me to write such a thing .	Sometimes it 's better to have it out on the page .	but
0	146545	Drawn toward his body at the same time , needing to be .	Stretched out on top of him .	and
0	130722	`` okay , here 's what we think , '' amelia said .	Just like that , phase one was in place .	and
2	65261	She may have gotten her wish about the bed .	Nothing was going to keep me away from sky .	but
1	3002	You had no right to run to schulke like a schoolgirl and shove it up my ass .	Someone else screwed up and put 477s on the wrong shelf .	because
0	61000	When the black volhv says `` uh-oh '' .	Then runs for his life .	and
3	124714	And , he would have seen that . '' .	He 'd loved you the way he should have loved his wife .	if
1	114037	And i wanted to keep something of her .	They told me i 'd never be able to see her .	because
0	148228	Her clothes were on fire .	She was screaming claiming that she was burning .	and
4	101753	Inching his face toward the corner of the archway .	The murderous insanity in the hallway erupted into the fever pitch of close combat .	when
2	69339	He 'd missed seeing her carry diana .	He was definitely enjoying her .	but
2	128853	The paradigm lasted several hundred years .	Now has been cast aside in its totality being but a very specific case of a more general theory .	but
4	136664	Amelie and caden were going to tear sofie to pieces .	She told them what she needed to do .	when
2	99024	I dont want to be overly optimistic .	I really think we might be perhaps talking about several million euros .	but
2	103802	He lives in new york .	I understand he spends a lot of time in palm beach .	but
0	52362	Those who had lived here had made it truly a home .	Left behind the echoes of their happiness .	and
2	122592	He didnt know what dark magic they used .	He didnt want to give them a chance to take control of the sack swords and swell their own ranks .	but
4	59732	Annie 's biggest mistake had been not stopping .	People finally realized something was going on .	when
4	51694	Nearly weeping with relief .	Her fingers finally make contact with its jagged metal edges .	when
4	106373	They make perfect targets .	They 're standing still like that .	when
3	82751	Why tell a story .	You yourself cant be bothered to work out how it ends .	if
2	31805	It took a moment or two .	The sound of her mother 's voice , and the disapproval in it , helped emma to refocus her blurred vision .	but
0	5405	She had a witch 's penetrating eyes .	The soul of janet seemed to look out of them .	and
0	131961	Ill redirect people as i see them , i say to sara .	Sprint up the steps , not waiting for a response .	and
0	102563	She ran through the gate .	The little dog followed her up the front steps of her house and .	and
2	157100	Each of her breaths came laced with grass and mud and she welcomed the scent of sweating horseflesh .	She spat out the sediment .	but
2	22010	We had to give sophie a lot of space .	She grew up just fine .	but
0	151359	He slung the backpack over his shoulders .	Proceeded down the caves passage .	and
2	61566	I glanced at julia and then harry , lastly at tori and sebastian .	Saw that everyone seemed as perplexed as i was .	but
2	77363	Wondered if i had offended his pride .	When i looked up and met his stare a shock of some emotion rocked my body leaving me breathless .	but
2	115214	Juliet pushed him aside and .	Pulled the baby down even as everyone stared at her in dismay .	but
2	98182	It was tricky to find a vantage .	He managed and peered through the vent .	but
2	123789	Charles and cindy had never been as demonstrative as my parents were .	You could never be too sure .	but
4	13469	Maybe nobody had believed the guard from the cells .	He told the story .	when
2	77583	I was dizzy from this litany .	Mia seemed to hang on her every word , to pay more attention to the details of her surgeries than to the news of her family .	but
4	158299	She goes to bed and stays there for three days .	We get back to my place .	when
2	154019	Who is everything to me has no desire to be close to me , or to let me get close to him .	Who can set my body on fire with just one look , and .	but
0	87158	To do my part and drive them off of elandis for good .	Take the war to the imperium .	and
0	36470	I 'll be a just a moment .	Then step back to hold the door open for my mom .	and
3	98299	Please encourage your friends to download their own free copy .	You enjoyed this book .	if
0	29787	So he held her stare .	Knew that she felt the new link between them .	and
0	131954	Angelique alea waved to jessie .	She gave her a wisp of a smile that soon disappeared .	and
0	51524	My nephews stood watching .	Into the room had come aunt esther and mara .	and
0	84201	Heading down the stairs .	Looking at us like we 're crazy .	and
2	127768	`` i 'd like to taste your pretty mouth , lick those full pink lips before i see them wrapped around my dick .	That 's not the way cam plays ... can i touch them ? '' .	but
2	156137	It went against every sniveling thread of pride i 'd ever felt to admit that .	That was the truth and the truth was what it was .	but
0	143993	They picked up the mazda .	Set off back via nanaimo .	and
1	38876	He 'd been sent to maryland to deliver a message to naval intelligence .	Ty had specifically chosen him for the mission .	because
0	16207	I 'd ever fed from .	Even that was just the .	and
4	94776	Thought better of it .	He put a shot over their heads .	when
0	138396	You all scowl wave your arms in the air about it .	Love 's supposed to be fun , but .	and
3	116737	`` but what are we going to do about reah .	She comes out of this .	if
0	57964	Very simple , '' he said .	Steepled his fingers under his chin .	and
2	124482	I waited for carter to drop out .	Instead , he reraised .	but
0	159356	I can be your lady-in-waiting . '' .	No one else could do that for you .	and
0	132063	I kept our general direction firmly in mind .	Simply followed the course of least resistance .	and
2	107572	None of them expected me to run from them .	That 's what i did .	but
2	120996	Danny had followed her directive , and .	They were going nascar speed .	but
3	139095	Sweetie , is it okay .	We walk her back .	if
2	149406	I 'd ask you for a coffee . '' .	I know that 's not your strong point .	but
3	127641	She 'd defeat cain , and this would all be .	She could stay alive until the duels .	if
4	15604	We were only a few feet from the table .	We drew marco 's gaze .	when
1	138346	If i 'm talking to a bunch of rats , it 's and everyone should listen to me .	Something dangerous is coming .	because
0	14978	I piled up the pillows behind me , keeping the sound very low .	Turned on the television .	and
0	93660	That light will shine out from it and the force field will deflect it .	Send it back onto you .	and
0	158691	He lifted the bowl of steaming red liquid .	Handed it to the clever boy , who took a drink and gave a great cry .	and
3	102353	And , he 'd have a good idea that the name was original .	The question drew blank stares all round .	if
2	622	Claire thinks its interference from the antennas , and i know its mom .	I just say , sure , it has to be , honey .	but
0	155439	I leaped to the ground , climbing up into the cab to join jackson and bodo .	Walked around the passenger side of the truck .	and
2	92487	Sure , i still killed people .	Usually only to protect my friends , family , or myself .	but
2	5609	I wanted to see if anyone knew anything , told me that it had disappeared , and that i was chasing an illusion .	They all just laughed at me .	but
0	32051	It took centuries of that before i could wear flesh .	It lasted only minutes .	and
4	123045	You wandering around arche .	Everyone wants to know who you 've come here to kill .	when
2	63749	He started to speak and reached for me .	I took his hands and asked him to bear with me just a bit longer .	but
0	28333	He idly dodged vazumals attack .	Grabbed his neck in a choke hold .	and
4	29076	You doing that to our history instructor .	He fell asleep during his own lecture .	when
4	67311	I leaned closer and searched his blue eyes .	The man leaned back in his chair .	when
4	21005	Youll learn about it , and that made her stomach lurch .	You he didnt finish .	when
3	139089	They would have a backup ready .	Jack fought his way out of one .	if
2	134249	I apologize . '' .	In all the excitement yesterday , i seem to have forgotten .	but
2	40710	Somehow , someway , we were going to have to find a way to not only forgive each other .	To forgive our past .	but
0	12653	Eventually he looked into her eyes whispered youve made me the happiest man on earth .	Smiled a relieved smile .	and
2	6006	Weller 's skin was ash and his voice was a knife .	His swollen eyes were pink .	but
4	47489	Her gaze was on his lips ? '' .	She murmured , `` what would one day hurt .	when
4	85917	It hid in the shrubs .	I walked home on those chilly fall evenings after the sunhad tucked in .	when
2	47204	She had been exhausted , knowing that she was alone with carlo and his extra broad shoulders .	After peter and jeff left , her body had become wide .	but
3	100214	Then that alone could change the outcome of this war .	This sect has found a way to reproduce and grow their numbers .	if
4	151821	My pulse sped up .	I saw the name .	when
3	81268	I shall not touch you . '' .	You do not wish me to .	if
4	160790	Gave a muted oooh of pleasure .	She saw a black suede .	when
4	114647	He 'd tell her .	The photograph had been taken the next time he saw her .	when
2	122992	She has done nothing .	Try to help her own daughter .	but
2	50145	He 's doing it subtly . '' .	The signs are there .	but
4	5337	You dash madly about , and you never walk when you can run .	An impulse takes you .	when
3	26515	It means i could entrust it to them .	I 'm able to lend it to you .	if
0	146492	For good and proper reasons , we have denied ourselves this power . '' .	We must all agree to it before any of us might attempt this violation of the natural order of things .	and
0	95120	So that white men could look you over , as a kind of concubine .	Buy you from your owner .	and
2	38411	Distant noises hinted at freaks in other tunnels .	They stepped carefully and didnt draw attention .	but
0	51256	Kevin abandoned his books and computer games .	Sat in his bedroom , staring out of the window , not wanting to talk .	and
2	27813	The idea made her stomach churn .	She also realized places like this that supplied entertainment needed to make their money .	but
0	94347	The dogs and spit lizards chased the living ones around , while the snakes , wrought up by the commotion , became extremely quick to bite anything that moved .	Got into fights over them .	and
2	156552	It took a moment for her eyes to adjust to the darkness .	When she did , she couldnt believe what she saw .	but
2	2332	Especially when william missed the iron nails .	Hit the ones attached to his thumb or fingers .	but
0	125077	They sat on logs a little way from it .	Between them was a rough wooden table , on which stood a rude clay lamp lighting up their pale faces and throwing big shadows on the walls .	and
0	91882	The one tie ansel had left to her father , her family .	Whatever twisted shred of hope burned in her heart .	and
2	20691	I saw her walk up to this guy .	Then i was distracted by mcgrady .	but
0	3889	Two regal white egrets left their ankle-deep hunting stance .	Began the slow , beating run that would take them into the air .	and
2	4360	Something else had filled the top and .	Was pouring through the pinch .	but
2	156424	`` they will love you when they see how happy you make me ... and - you always did .	You do , tru - make me happy .	but
3	146174	Youll make my shop famous .	Your larger work is as good .	if
2	109476	Kevan lannister tried to cry out ... to his guards , his wife , his brother .	The words would not come .	but
4	63786	Cinti said , `` bald men are particularly interested . '' .	Asked about the public reaction to the cactus .	when
4	14790	He moved back to her , bending low and kissing her .	He saw the surprise in her eyes .	when
3	142096	If it 's no imposition-would you think about giving pam a call .	I gave you our phone number and you 've got a few minutes-i mean .	if
4	116648	I discovered that all children were grown , eighteen and up , and were working in the fields .	I got to her old shanty .	when
0	48797	It is not easy very much depends on the tide .	It is possible , so i believe , but . ' .	and
0	135716	Pultrie asked , anchoring on gideons voice .	Took a cautious step .	and
0	116581	The tip of my tongue ran over my lips .	I could taste salt .	and
2	27229	`` yeah i did .	That guy was enjoying himself too damn much .	but
0	134472	Who 's on the right ? '' .	Who 's on the left .	and
2	29585	He would love to hear the answers to all of those questions .	For now , he was charged with his patients safe arrival .	but
4	154094	But , this shit never happened . '' .	We step onto that stage .	when
1	45976	Two of her friends you slept with are upset with you . '' .	You never called them .	because
3	87772	Old fears will resurface and they will strike out at us .	We color too far out of humanity 's self-imposed lines .	if
0	89845	The king spoke with one of his masters .	Glanced at tavolo who stood beside him .	and
2	686	`` that 's a direct question . '' .	I expect that from you .	but
0	141392	When bart finally had him near the opening , he reached up .	Helped by gripping the edge and pulling himself the rest of the way .	and
0	38716	I 'd seen how other human captives were treated by other vampires .	Never bothered to help .	and
2	47550	There was a power-pack inside that had begun life as a fuzz-buster .	Beyond that she was completely blank .	but
2	40951	It might not seem like .	It was the most a job had paid me up to that point .	but
0	146597	Evan ordered our drinks .	Then turned back to ashley with a knowing look on his face .	and
2	40229	We were friends and that deserved compensation .	He would also be running some risks in helping me .	but
3	124577	`` , you 're welcome to .	Any of you would like to join me in my office .	if
4	152118	To sign me up for carpal tunnel surgery .	He gets that thing out of me .	when
3	86389	At that time , they would have lost the plantation and their lives .	They had been caught .	if
2	2282	Langdon opened his mouth to protest .	Sato was already turning to anderson at the door .	but
4	129033	The will had been drawn up years earlier .	They were the only ones capable of taking on such a task .	when
4	60426	How often did we do the same thing .	We found a mole who fled back to mother russia after looting us .	when
2	103400	It suits you fine when you need it .	The coming down from it usually means a crash .	but
1	43352	Youre not tackling diversity or violence against women in you art .	You might make mistakes then your real fear is you might have to rethink things and learn something and look at the world in a different way .	because
2	130661	I 'll try to find a pair in here ! '' .	You need to start looking while i do .	but
3	159723	I would have taken it for uncertainty .	It were really patrick .	if
3	152952	I will have de molay flayed in time for galerens arrival and it will be made known that it was because of your defiance .	You do not do as i say .	if
2	141661	Then better sense prevailed and ... should i confess and tell her what happened that night .	I suggested that we go to a pub .	but
0	22925	When you most need your map .	This is where people start to doubt the details of how i made it through those caverns that day .	and
2	68100	It to be a statement .	It came out a question .	but
2	137872	I know it was wrong .	The last thing i wanted to do was hurt you or your wife .	but
0	13304	He held out his hand .	Examined the choker , a small silver band with a teardrop sapphire mounted in silver with small emeralds surrounding it like a nest .	and
3	139261	Youll have to make an honest woman out of me .	We keep this up .	if
2	92232	He could move his right arm .	His left was pinned against the side of the chopper and his legs were trapped by the caved-in control panel .	but
2	24343	Instead , he took each blow , realising that she was not hitting out at him .	Hitting out at the world .	but
0	86661	Martin didnt know what he was looking for at .	Then he saw it , a faint green light pulsing at her wrist .	and
4	53326	To calm down hitler .	It 's time for a walk .	when
0	130633	Her husband put an arm around her waist .	She leaned into him .	and
0	107103	When his guests arrived .	He hurried back inside to greet them .	and
2	156390	Her stomach calmed down , and .	She asked the dreaded question .	but
2	8716	Basilio looked as if he wanted to object .	Instead said , `` fine .	but
0	10561	He 'd told them to be ready for disaster .	To lead the people out of the city .	and
4	130798	Built in the previous year .	The dangers of rhegeds growing strength threatened war one day .	when
0	145161	I know you dance like you 're having sex . '' .	I know that you taste like every man 's downfall .	and
0	30160	She walked over to the faucet .	Glanced back at her .	and
2	8429	He might have been enjoying the view .	Teresa knew him well enough to know that he was looking not at the resort , but at its guests .	but
2	133597	Drunk the lions share .	When it came time to leave stanly had to drive peter home .	but
0	85408	Even the fledglings crowding the street below could hear the broadcast through their cell phones .	My remarks would be recorded , and replayed all through the next day .	and
2	86453	The vision had shown the salon for what it was .	In the real world , the girls must still be of an age where they were safe-if anyone was in one of those places .	but
1	153027	His second thursday , yesterday , was worse .	He took them to aspen .	because
4	19350	I almost pulled grace from her ladder .	I swung round and grabbed the rungs below her .	when
0	122944	Fidelias shot aldrick a hard look , turning to amara .	Then licked his lips .	and
3	146980	He would leave her and destroy their family in the process .	He found out about her condition or her relationship with peter .	if
4	140460	Morrow asked us finally and .	Dale told his story about the knife .	when
0	74488	I go get us a pair of horses .	You go get any specific supplies you think we need .	and
2	49389	His body moving inside hers .	It was mostly the scrumptious , momentous , earth-shattering explosion of her body she was feeling .	but
2	145882	Say made love because i truly did love stava with all my heart .	It was a different kind of love .	but
0	17306	He 's a monster .	He must have something on them .	and
4	30738	Went as rigid as suzanne .	His hand , hidden from the others , drifted down to finger a golden curl and lightly caresses her .	when
0	50171	It takes me over an hour to finish working on her face and neck .	The maid is long gone by .	and
0	148348	Worn blankets were pinned to the windows for curtains .	His bed was only a threadbare sleeping blanket on the floor with a single pillow that was so old and flat he might as well not have it .	and
4	76818	I saw that stone was still giving his .	I finished giving my statement .	when
2	133491	Lisa was too weak to move .	Through the back window , she watched dark woods and tall cliffs roll past , suggesting they were in the mountains .	but
4	100614	Half the children begging for a jet-airplane trip to america and the other half dreaming of the day .	They can own a telephone-computer like yours .	when
2	133273	Veda ( in sanskrit ) means knowledge ( gnosis ) , deriving from the root vid - ( indo-european ) meaning to see/know .	The term has come to signify , for the english speaking world , the hindu bible .	but
4	63284	Sympathy softened her face even more .	Colin lowered himself painfully onto a chair .	when
4	148375	The ferry was already moving .	The humvee skittered onto the ramp .	when
4	28771	But my anger caught .	He smiled and winked at me .	when
3	132069	`` , you have to be naked , too ! '' .	You 're going to do this .	if
4	98398	She let out a little scream .	She was abruptly jerked .	when
0	39069	Instead , she turned , forced a small smile .	Gingerly took the picture .	and
0	146733	Heven when i opened my eyes , my vision was blurred .	The room was dim .	and
2	16629	She would have liked to blame her lack of comprehension on the pain medication .	Since she hadnt taken any recently , she supposed that wasnt sufficient excuse .	but
0	159785	Striding past the desk , coming even closer to the glass than mab had .	Walking over to the windows .	and
4	23702	The office had apparently been created .	A bedroom had been split into two smaller rooms by means of a drywall partition that interrupted the crown molding and baseboard that otherwise continued around the room .	when
4	42583	I lose all sense of myself .	I 'm with you .	when
2	95319	Cole had slight reservations about being questioned at the check-in point .	Oddly , it was unmanned .	but
4	96137	Kylie took his hand , ready to help him if needed .	They reached the five-foot fence .	when
0	147637	Doyle put a hand on either of rhys 's shoulders .	Began walking him back toward us .	and
2	66239	She felt he wanted to cry out for salvation .	Something he had done earned him that place in the car , sealed the doors shut for his journey into a waiting hell .	but
3	39240	Then it will be .	The clue is carved in stone .	if
4	158165	My chest would get .	I thought about him leaving .	when
2	28865	I am ashamed of myself far too proud to admit it and .	He is in too good of a mood for me to destroy it .	but
3	10833	I was in trouble .	Jesse assumed it would carry on the rest of the summer .	if
0	88318	That held her gown to her body .	Let it fall in one piece .	and
0	116390	To go down after him .	Bring him back when puckens and shortear returned with a grey-haired man between them .	and
4	118377	He got raina the job there . '' .	She first moved to town .	when
2	74127	Samuel always seemed so strong and confident and to have no interest in me at all .	Now i could see that i was wrong about that , at least a little .	but
3	93369	I 'd beat it .	I had any sense .	if
0	53624	Nearby , leyten laughed .	Gave him pointers on how to hold the thing .	and
2	34187	Violating his vows was bad .	To consider misusing this beleaguered woman was horrendous .	but
2	62180	Belgarath had not contributed anything to the discussions .	Rather had sat brooding out at the storm from a deep-cushioned chair by the window .	but
2	64	I got up , circling as far around the body as i could get .	Before i reached the veranda door , i had changed my mind .	but
0	134975	Nearest us cling to the wall .	Use a smaller tentacle to put the safety on the gun .	and
0	66171	Cans , pots , and jars rattled as they collided with shelves and stored goods .	Crashed to the floor .	and
4	83805	I now know a little better .	I look at photographs from that period .	when
1	28158	My father had been andais 's unofficial ambassador to the goblins .	No one else wanted the job .	because
3	82885	Then there 's a danger that some very vulnerable people will be left without support . ' .	The parish refuses to renew the lease on the building , and the district cuts funding .	if
0	140241	We 're trying to restructure our duties . '' .	Some of us are in disagreement about who the new leaders should be .	and
2	69753	In a short time she had become less reticent about her pleasure .	She had yet to initiate any contact .	but
0	34759	Before the disastrous war , the emperor of mallorea had often been little more than a figurehead .	Power had largely rested with the bureaucracy .	and
0	97554	I returned to my rooms .	Went looking for mother with my mind .	and
4	114267	Everything had been okay .	We left the beach house , at least i thought .	when
0	13992	Last night i also comed general therman .	He assures me that key aspects of the report in the data cube on the two extraterrestrials are false .	and
0	24850	To welcome you to another year at thomas jefferson high .	To remind you that it 's time to put away your summer brains and bring out your thinking caps .	and
3	51536	But , itll be more than they can handle .	At the same time a rat comes sailing down from above them .	if
0	104034	He staggered up on his own .	Walked to the center of the arena .	and
4	150072	To see the look on that bitch 's face .	She saw you in the darkling 's color .	when
3	28157	How they would feel .	They knew we were sleeping .	if
0	125987	About was the possibility of being an orphan .	Never seeing janelle again might be true this time .	and
0	36196	Him to come to flukes the next evening .	I hung up the phone .	and
2	24010	Not all of them who waded into the waters of lethe found it necessary to take a bath in it .	There were enough - kids who had made dreams their protein .	but
2	144571	Twice he almost stopped .	Both times he reminded himself that this was for her good .	but
2	30132	The good doctor was running more tests .	As of now , dallas was stable .	but
2	70828	After homework was done , he would try to get her to sit and watch a basketball game or an episode of the simpsons with him .	She only wanted to watch her movies .	but
4	33783	I found myself standing in the middle of the lounge at council hq .	The brief darkness lifted .	when
4	62148	Let you break my heart ? '' .	It 's al said and done .	when
2	66223	Looking out the window at the passing scenery for a while .	The overtaking darkness took care of that .	but
2	124989	It was hard to imagine tommy pulling a plow with henry , who looked very much the part .	Tommy was clearly born for rock music .	but
4	67957	Lashonda 's green eyes shone from the darkness of her black-furred face , and her mouth twisted into a mischievous , mysterious smile .	She finally looked up at him .	when
4	122164	He shook his head , so she pulled harder .	She tugged on his horns to pry him .	when
2	45580	Pointing out the obvious .	Mike , you 're gorgeous .	but
2	9569	He 'd laid the groundwork for her returning to new york as he 'd promised her he would do .	Damned he would give her up that .	but
2	12235	Until then , i 'm you 're mom , and .	We 've got to stay .	but
4	154837	He found cassidy , human again , sitting in one of reid 's ordinary kitchen chairs , the man 's groceries spilling over the table .	He came back to the kitchen .	when
0	64220	Tie me , with the baby right beside me . '' .	Leave me there for hours .	and
4	107100	His hands slowly glide down my arms , my sides , up my belly to my breasts .	The last knot is cinched .	when
4	147358	Frank lonergan was waiting in the lobby of the four seasons .	Jackie houston returned from the white house .	when
2	153722	Christians also were sometimes known to sin .	The grace of christ provided the remedy of penitence , even for those who transgressed against the law of chastity .	but
4	105780	How wonderful things were really going .	You considered everything with max .	when
2	14653	She asked when she found them .	She had eyes only for simon .	but
2	93024	`` dis , be quiet , '' kate snapped ? '' .	Stayed cheerful when she addressed the brothers , `` how do the two of you know this woman that you 're asking about .	but
2	40226	Her singsong voice was barely above a whisper .	Trapper could still hear how uncomfortable she sounded .	but
4	18473	I am a total nincompoop .	It comes to trying to figure out women .	when
2	113738	You can suspect all you like .	I gave that money .	but
1	127499	The reason why your mother left your father was .	The queen didnt give permission for her husband to officially take another wife , and you mother couldnt accept that .	because
0	119086	The commune could still be under control of those gangsters .	We would think trevor was dead .	and
3	7710	He looked in her eyes .	We werent in the same band .	if
2	50634	His sources are trustworthy or , belnavar said nonetheless , i will carry out your plan .	Not is what bothers me .	but
2	54519	He repeated his command .	The outcome was no different .	but
2	66509	Under the onslaught , he briefly thought about driving over to the caldwell international airport .	He decided to keep driving because he needed to get a grip and that was going to take time .	but
0	72857	The stranger was yelling .	Marwan felt chills down his spine .	and
0	94251	Lukas dropped his shirt .	Joined his father on the bench .	and
3	128890	Sir robert can mop them up .	We can lure the frenchies .	if
2	147364	The room was crowded with not only the husband , whose accent seemed to have changed several times during the hours of waiting .	The mother had insisted on bringing her assistant into the delivery room .	but
0	145573	Did you use your magic .	Cause their minds to forget .	and
3	18180	It would be nice .	We brought dad a glass of wine every night .	if
0	106210	Clancy opened the cupboard and climbed .	Took out a leather-wrapped package .	and
0	134460	These two have crossed our paths .	Come to our attention numerous times .	and
0	129610	I picked off another guard , close to the path .	Jumped to my feet .	and
0	135531	Alex ran her fingers through jaklin 's thick hair .	Then went to get the brush her grandmother had used on her own .	and
3	128317	And , it was strider .	Anyone understood the sting of rejection .	if
2	19481	To ask about these people , whoever they are .	I understand enough of the picture he 's trying to paint .	but
0	125469	How the wind might drive off the mist more .	Give them an early answer .	and
3	6002	`` , you must have one .	We all have triggers .	if
3	18595	Would have been nice .	They 'd asked her first rather than just frigging selling her to the highest bidder .	if
3	141851	This building the size of a small city .	Even her cousin and his snake people could find her .	if
2	90336	( recorded as such since life was indeed aware of firing it no data .	The polarity was not certain .	but
2	70455	I was covered in a sheet .	There was no outline of my legs .	but
4	103512	I breathed a sigh of relief .	Liz settled in and started going on and on about the gym she probably hadnt stepped foot in .	when
3	18153	He 'd be lucky .	He had a couple of coronas in the fridge .	if
2	128060	As it happens , i will consider marrying you for the sake of our child . '' .	Only certain conditions are fulfilled .	but
2	77881	His face was difficult to see in the dark .	His voice sounded a little wary .	but
2	131651	I find his version quite plebeian , in fact .	What matters is that he bought it .	but
0	87694	It is not well known , if you dont mind .	The squire would rather like to keep it that way .	and
0	141741	He reached out grasped the djinn 's hand , pulling him to his feet .	The crowned sun , mathias said , and .	and
0	43795	He watched it more closely , but alive , a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived .	Saw that it was not dirt at all .	and
2	84772	I want to get our son back as badly as you do . '' .	This is not the way .	but
4	37200	He said that it was like trying to love and discipline a child .	Asked to explain complementarity to the copenhagen pta .	when
0	10221	He looked up at the dark trees around him , at the pines soaring above the scrub oaks , at the dark tortured shapes of the monterey cypress forever grasping in desperation for what they would never reach .	He felt a strange longing to shed his clothes and to move off into the forest alone-to break out of the shell of this all too human discomfort into a different and savage realm .	and
2	1574	It was hard to tell from my vantage point .	I 'd bet big bucks it was a vice royal .	but
0	13539	He disregarded her heated words . '' .	Said , `` there are things you need to learn .	and
0	116374	Skinner , one of his newly acquired crewmen off the shipwreck , step out of the focsle .	Wondered why the man was not at supper with the rest of the crew .	and
0	27650	The two brothers laughed and through the woods .	Soon shot off down the mountain .	and
3	155277	You are excused from the table .	You need fresh air .	if
0	72701	Her hand dipped into her pouch .	Came out with three simple metal hooks .	and
4	124779	But , you will be moving in with us , and you will be going to counseling .	You leave this hospital .	when
0	133302	Charlie grabbed the envelope quickly ! '' .	Called out , `` hey , baca .	and
3	644	For all those numbers , there are .	Countless more who wish for it , dream of it only i could they may wistfully ponder .	if
1	117084	Turned to them with calm , patient and what must have been very detailed reassurance .	It defused their tension .	because
0	48028	Then he brought her head to his .	Did what he had been fixating on for the last two hours .	and
1	141782	No one would dare attack our country , ever . '' .	We 'd annihilate the running dogs and capitalist jellyfish mongrels .	because
0	45897	My heart clenched at the thought of owen , imagining it as a drumbeat and letting it steady me .	I focused on the tightness in my chest .	and
2	29015	Know i am not good enough for you and i will prove myself to your family if i have to .	I am a hard worker .	but
4	131597	Both summers , she did it often for him , his family , their friends and she 'd cooked and served fabulous tasting meals like it was second nature .	She 'd been there twenty years .	when
3	75218	Justin had no idea .	It was from simple exertion .	if
2	128876	They could have fought to keep their prisoners . '' .	They were more interested in acquiring ken .	but
3	137026	`` , '' she sniffs , making me laugh .	Not you use language like that around our child .	if
0	137230	The word pops unbidden into my mind .	I try to shake it off .	and
0	85422	When it hit the bottom , it smashed into hundreds of tiny pieces . '' .	When i looked more closely , i saw that they were all drops of blood .	and
0	16164	Since the child had always been fed in the shallow pool at the grotto 's mouth , she was swimming even before she began to grow teeth , but she was soon toddling about the grotto , squeaking dolphin words as she went .	She started walking-and running-not long after her diet changed .	and
2	77008	I know this is unorthodox .	I have a feelin ethan will surprise us all .	but
1	125410	This was a mistake .	One second later , i felt tack 's heat against my back .	because
4	82984	That 's worrying-it 's always a horrible feeling on a plane .	You see the professionals acting like there 's trouble in store .	when
0	103629	She 's sipping coffee .	Thumbing through the art info .	and
0	34013	You have held the post for sixteen years .	If rumors are to be believed , you are the true ruler of the empire .	and
0	153803	We could be facing cells ! '' .	Watch each other and howl at the moon .	and
2	10543	You 've claimed that the love of a simple soldier is nothing before the mantle of a queen .	I say the measure of a man is not in his title , but in his soul .	but
0	157640	But the vineyard of eyes drank in their sounds .	Gave them nothing in return .	and
2	135343	The gas released will go .	The gel left will linger .	but
0	9769	Slipping her hand into her deep pocket , she closed her fingers around the kadhara 's handle .	Walked briskly back toward the corso .	and
4	123786	`` there 's no reason to leave now , '' cole said .	My tears finally stopped and i could breathe .	when
3	53677	Then would you mind getting the hell out of my personal space .	Youre not going to kill me .	if
4	16173	First night were foolish-no , shameless .	We met in the garden and i asked you to dance with me .	when
0	119690	Zakath was a fencer .	He feinted and parried with his massive , though nearly weightless sword .	and
0	99854	What must be one of his greatest secrets .	Paul had no idea why .	and
0	44094	She wants to be treated like other valkyrie .	That 's how i treat them .	and
2	78456	Terror turned his blood to ice .	Adrenaline spurred him into action .	but
0	31790	Her eyes lifted to his .	He knew she was pissed .	and
1	104349	They cruised down the strip it was on the way , and jazz made verbal note of all the things she wanted to do later , when things were .	It was there and besides .	because
2	101091	He scanned the messages on oasis .	Again there was nothing .	but
0	98566	I got out dumont 's guide .	Read over the entry for ulsharavas .	and
3	118474	She will destroy the entire world .	She is ever released .	if
0	119338	To leave his father .	Come to england to stay with her aunt alanna .	and
0	141671	Joe spared a quick glance .	Saw krieger checking the sight on the machine gun .	and
4	94237	Who came over to our table .	I was at carmelita high school .	when
2	24956	She 'd recognized no one .	She supposed the person could be wearing a disguise .	but
2	70855	I bowed my head , wondering what torment i should know .	My mistress said very gently that i was to rise .	but
0	21292	He took deeper into the labyrinth .	When after only a few minutes , he looked back the way he had came .	and
4	155257	She stared up at three armored shapes silhouetted against the dull light .	The locker door tore .	when
4	7240	After all , here he was , at the same place in the middle of the day .	He was supposed to be at work .	when
1	124074	It then must have somehow reached my heart .	I could actually feel it begin to slow .	because
2	122566	He was a handsome man .	His eyes seemed different from other people , like he had walked out of the medieval times in europe .	but
2	90260	He either noticed my eyes widening or heard the collective gasp of the crowd , or quite possibly , his super accurate hearing heard the crack and calculated the destination of the ball without ever looking .	His head snapped around at the same time that his hand snapped up .	but
0	65256	I swallowed the growl in my throat , feeling stupid .	Rubbed the still-tingling skin on my neck where he 'd kissed it .	and
3	37168	It all being so fantastical and even if you force yourself on me , because you will have to every time , i will never love you .	Even my parents force me to marry you upon hearing all i have to say none of which they will believe .	if
4	159937	He kissed the back of my hand .	I stood to clamber out of the boat .	when
3	143160	They 'd need to figure it out .	They were going to learn anything about what had happened to mistress jane 's creatures .	if
3	142142	I had to get these .	I wanted to make any real money .	if
0	23348	... '' she came over .	Wrote something on the little pad on the bedside table .	and
0	4512	After something like nine or ten minutes , the yogi turned his head to one side .	Speaking either to the flowers or the splashing fountain , ordered sweet tea and honey cakes .	and
4	133365	Her fingers moving in his hair , zayn knew that this path was not a good plan .	She was trembling in his arms .	when
0	37283	My head ached , but not nearly as much as .	My vision was beginning to slowly return .	and
2	87251	A shiver down my spine as it once did .	Now it burrowed to the core of my being , deep into my soul , a sharp sword piercing my body , my spirit scrambling to reassemble all the broken parts .	but
2	154390	It was me , of course .	Had i not put on the dress beforehand , i would have really been thrown for a loop because i had never looked like this in my entire life .	but
2	20071	The high-school-caliber groping we have going on is nice .	I know max is ready for more .	but
0	125036	However , the human race is not prepared for access to our technology .	We have therefore decided that you will not be allowed to settle on this planet .	and
0	91893	Winter may arrive early .	May be colder than expected .	and
0	11527	We helped the flight medics set her on the litter .	I squeezed her hand one more time , and she gave me a weak grin .	and
1	143304	I was carrying my big slouchy purse .	Matt had insisted i bring the sex toys .	because
4	157850	Colt was nowhere to be found .	I walked out of the bathroom .	when
4	105618	Chugach and iluliaq looked upset .	Especially tarleton described the old-fashioned robes .	when
2	139665	He might better have been named sparrow .	Apparently his mother had thought to give him a prouder name than that .	but
2	61574	I had something a little different in mind .	You 'd rather watch tv .	but
4	31725	Her breath caught and the same emotions filled her chest .	She met his sexy , hooded eyes and saw the heat and desire .	when
3	141709	They 'd just earned themselves an automatic pass to the interview stages to be his new pa. too old . .	Any of them happened to mention their coffee making skills .	if
0	154898	Nothing i did was ever good enough for him .	After twenty-two years , i was beyond tired of it .	and
4	107573	It to take place on the feast day of st. valentine .	It would be such an auspicious start to the marriage .	when
1	7160	He still wore a business suit and looked utterly terrifying .	His face was devoid of any joy .	because
3	55247	Then that is their future . '' .	The lassie says the boys will die if i dinna come in .	if
1	145795	Most of which i had rejected earlier , but it only had to be large enough to conceal one end of a tunnel .	I was looking for a basement large enough to conceal at least a couple of dozen women .	because
2	31709	We 're already improvising .	Maybe the bastards can still be drawn out .	but
0	29258	Adrian had just texted to let him know that sissy was reading in her bed , and .	The angel was counting the lint in his navel .	and
2	154559	She didnt care about her husbands state of health .	The longer they took , the more time there was for him to come out of his doped-up stupor and beat the living crap out of her .	but
2	40300	I just put them there for testing purposes .	I never took them down .	but
0	65612	Wearing the frock coat of a vice admiral , adorned with the four stars of the highest orders of the land , is lord viscount horatio nelson , hero of the nile and copenhagen roads .	The burden of history weighs heavy on his narrow shoulders when i read through on the screen before clicking the send button .	and
0	155078	She placed her hand on her chest .	Felt her heart galloping .	and
3	102497	I 'll check and call .	It 's livy and you 're needed .	if
0	3068	Demurely , callipygia rose .	Gracefully crossed the floor to the window .	and
0	5000	His lips were demanding .	When he tugged on her lower lip with his teeth , she yielded to him .	and
3	3580	Anyway cause thats what started the whole thing .	Gretchen went down the cops would figure out that junior killed amanda .	if
2	150190	Grandpa 's watch had been sitting idly in my hands .	Now i started twirling it .	but
2	18402	My dad had a heart attack a few years back and he loves those weekends .	It 's tough on him .	but
3	116590	`` but , it 'll be my fault . '' .	Something happens to you .	if
2	41700	She tried to talk herself out of watching him as he walked across the room .	It was no use .	but
3	79707	You will forfeit your weapon . '' .	You strike her once she 's requested a break .	if
0	101557	His head was bandaged , but the pain had lost most of its sharpness .	He could feel his leg still hurt .	and
0	109612	The past will come .	A new generation will take their place , as arria cries out for salvation .	and
4	16834	It came back a list of u.s. and european operatives in the area .	I put those names into the database .	when
2	75683	The subject is not about truth ideas , and .	Covers everything from politics to the paranormal .	but
4	151477	They were sometimes called .	Men wore them-were a look that worked on very few men .	when
3	11470	We 're going to have to start within the hour .	We 're going to get anywhere and do what we came over here for .	if
0	151648	When my people went to war with the white men , many were killed .	Many of those killed did not receive proper burials .	and
0	119728	He flipped it open id card .	Pulled out his farnsworth industries .	and
0	118460	Let go of the trapdoor .	Made a motion to stand .	and
2	128406	I know it 's really last minute . '' .	It starts in like an hour , and we can just meet there if you want , or i can pick you up , or ... whatever .	but
4	122283	He would be observing .	No one could possibly have known .	when
0	133174	A few more insincere pleasantries exchanged .	Then the constable was gone .	and
2	34920	He fell to his knees and nothing caught .	Blew on the puny embers and set fresh kindling over them .	but
3	118831	Theyd soon be dead .	They didnt do something .	if
3	131634	I 'm also wondering .	You could take a look at this .	if
0	130246	Allison shook her head .	Hurried to thain 's side .	and
0	64614	He closed his eyes .	Murmured , its only a text book .	and
0	158746	Niobe grabbed his hand .	Dragged him away from the burning salt caverns .	and
2	129148	The tower still grinned across the valley .	The light was fading in it .	but
4	25091	`` you scared us , honey , '' raid said .	Ryker finally let her go .	when
3	50640	For instance i could have cast a spell to lower him safely to the ground .	Coco had slipped when i was trying to haul him in off the roof .	if
2	63214	She couldnt see his eyes behind the dark sunglasses .	She had an impression of cold fury .	but
3	73894	I 'd appreciate it .	You gave me a little time to make sense of things .	if
2	24532	That 's one option , and it 's my sense that that 's the big mistake the residents of abandon made .	I looked at the door .	but
4	145838	She was not going .	To he saw and heard heidi 's opening remarks to the libyan that had stepped forward to speak to her .	when
2	49328	We were at the library a lot longer than he wanted to be .	We ended up having to wait for my manager to get there so i could explain to her exactly what was going on .	but
4	24016	He dragged a thumb across his bottom lip , and i was ready to jump him .	His gaze reached my hips .	when
4	134	It was never storybook blue .	You could find the sky .	when
2	1217	Wo david williams ( and he now had an aching jaw to prove it .	The sas was a very unconventional service , striking an officer was still a serious offence , or so he thought .	but
0	98676	The snow will stop by morning . '' .	We 'll hit the store .	and
2	11795	It was old grey wood , splintery and plain .	It stood to the right of the door through which she 'd entered .	but
0	52090	My gloves were leather , but i dared not take them off ; her shirt was sleeveless and her pants were short .	Not meant to get soaked .	and
0	5693	Hes badly bruised it looks as if his arm is broken .	Hes now in his human form , but .	and
0	46580	She reached into the locker with both hands .	Pulled out two big fat bulbs .	and
2	115382	There is not so much work in this area now , and .	I have people relying on me for employment .	but
4	51822	He sighed and blew into his hands then rubbed them .	She closed the door behind him .	when
2	157686	Making love to her was better than anything he 'd ever experienced before and he already wanted more .	A silence stretched between them and he figured he 'd better fill it .	but
4	83596	There 'd never been another man for her in all the years since .	She was eighteen years old-almost natalie 's age-and .	when
0	47556	Sixteen fallon i sat down in the armchair nearest the fireplace .	Watched as my uncle placed a glass of brandy and lovage on the wooden table beside the arm of his own very upright chair .	and
3	15564	How even a murderer can go free in no time at all .	They know the right strings to pull .	if
0	117669	After the first fifty or so , i started getting thirsty .	Walked over to the mini-refrigerator in the corner of the garage .	and
2	40414	She guessed the man in the doorway would know where durham avenue was .	She had no intention of asking him for directions .	but
1	77292	He seemed to sit up in bed .	She could hear the bed covers moving .	because
3	89520	But , they wouldnt come for another ten minutes at least .	Any other bomb squad guys showed up .	if
3	27417	I 'd play it even harder .	Colin 's parents were going to play that game .	if
1	131523	I could tell you guys what to do .	I was afraid its illusion would be so strong it could hide its reaction .	because
3	80550	I can find a date and well double .	You want to invite shane adams .	if
0	144738	Jaden wouldve been incredulous , the sense to do exactly that and also had the skill to isolate the intruder in his mind .	Angered as well as startled and highly displeased to know the boy had both the ability to mind .	and
1	67048	She bought me the ticket .	She says i should take more chances .	because
4	5050	How one could deny other spirits .	You had allowed one .	when
0	64517	Wearing a long white jacket .	Holding a medical chart in her paws .	and
2	95639	I think about the protective bubble that i so desperately crave .	I know that it has already cracked .	but
2	95712	I 'm sure that it is . '' .	We went to duluth .	but
2	7117	It was fussier than tessa would have preferred .	Jessamine had liked the design very much in the shop and had insisted that tessa have it made for her .	but
0	16279	His mother reached over .	Gathered him into her arms .	and
2	155054	He had lost many in such a long and terrible battle , counting the man who had fallen but was still alive and sitting up against the wall of the pub .	He began to laugh with joy as he reached 47 , 48 , 49 and 50 .	but
2	27139	You 're the richest nation the planet 's ever known .	You manipulate and hoard and then wonder why no one thanks you , much less likes you .	but
3	27029	Surely youll get bored with him too after a while .	You swap him in for hank .	if
0	23614	When he reluctantly pulled .	Looked into her eyes .	and
0	93063	Once night has fallen on the following day , they will bring down the walls , hopefully catching the enemy asleep and disoriented .	Our army will rush through .	and
2	4227	Pain had crept back in hours .	He 'd remained silent , not wanting to say her name .	but
2	41905	She had tried to talk to andrew parker about it .	From him she got only muttered comments that were contradictory in themselves , or didnt make any sense at all .	but
2	85252	There are people you know , and , and i had thought that you 'd only had a connection with me and jack .	There are people you have a connection with .	but
4	7647	Joe was there and i was .	Mike asked me over for dinner .	when
0	143332	He pulled a slip of paper out of his pocket .	Handed it to me .	and
2	103618	Even as i thought it , my throat closed , and .	I felt a pang of homesickness .	but
0	146613	They were targeting our support bags .	I knew it would not be much longer , or many more bags , before our ship was no longer airworthy .	and
3	98132	What mrs. halifax would do .	You shat in the castle .	if
1	133110	We always used a condom . '' .	We would never want to bring a kid into this messed-up world .	because
2	147373	Let us know were on the right track .	They can not just hand us the answers of the mysteries of the universe .	but
4	80569	`` and they will all get their badges out and flash them at the princess . '' .	We walk over there .	when
4	123434	What you were anglin ' .	You threw that hissy fit , not more than a half hour ago ? '' .	when
2	38906	Joshua hated to admit it .	That was pretty good .	but
2	101321	Meledrin began to say something .	Kim continued , cutting her off .	but
1	39634	Was clearly in a snit .	Janey , god help them all .	because
2	142817	Even anchula admitted being upset with thornbird at having been cheated with the bette davis house .	Told him that it wasnt worth murder .	but
4	93348	Where griffin was coming , here in the palace .	He was locked into his own little fantasy world .	when
1	100242	He 'd shoved some of the power to all his vampires .	The power had to go .	because
2	27686	We can not bury them .	Let us not bury our quest in their stead .	but
3	68680	What would 've happened .	Zayne had answered his phone .	if
4	124542	He thought wistfully of the younger days .	He had both feet , and .	when
0	459	`` i know you 're only trying to be respectful , but please ... '' she began .	Then made long uncomfortable eye contact .	and
2	110994	There was a motion at the edge of his vision .	He felt too tired to turn his head .	but
0	122214	She threw her arms around him .	Mumbled something , nonsense , into his shoulder .	and
4	156782	The silence was only broken .	Dexter said , thanks for coming to get me , as they entered the hotel .	when
0	58920	He knew the words to activate the protection in the event danger was present .	The gift was a treasure .	and
3	64147	He could pull it out , but only a little would come out at a time .	He wanted to , try to use it .	if
1	48265	Who was always gambling debt .	Although he was a good writer , he knew next to nothing about odds and mathematics .	because
0	72473	He popped the top off of his coffee cup .	Hurled it onto the table .	and
0	70299	She shook her head .	Began picking at lint on her karate uniform .	and
2	75406	Our chaplain took divinity classes .	That was about it .	but
2	15798	His lips were wide and meaty .	The thing men noticed first about him were his eyes .	but
0	145599	I 'd adored my father .	I 'd always known ( and my mother herself definitely believed ) that no matter what mother put me through , she was acting out of love .	and
2	42922	Before i can even begin to wrap my head around what that might mean , ethan takes my hand and .	Tugs me toward the closest bathroom .	but
2	4182	I kept low to the ground and the darkness kept me camouflaged from the germans .	I still ducked behind everything i could , which of course were mainly dead bodies .	but
0	119062	I mean , laylen was understanding everything , but .	Telling him that a talk-show-host voice told me i needed to visit stasha ... i even thought i sounded crazy .	and
2	4456	It was a mere reflex in front of armed people .	He didnt even have a knife with him .	but
3	129291	Hell have the money to make this palace look like a hovel .	Our investments work out .	if
2	114562	Bercelak was his father 's son and .	When he took a woman he wanted everyone to know he 'd claimed her .	but
4	45033	She tangled her fingers with his .	He handed her the gloves .	when
0	147258	They sat , as if i wasnt .	Stared glumly into the fire .	and
0	129390	A flurry of snowflakes whirled , only to land softly on the ground as they soon faded into mush .	Hurtled through the air .	and
3	17927	You 'll do what i tell you to .	You want her to stay out of it .	if
2	139885	He is in a half-rear before i realize it .	Then he brings both his hooves down in the exact same place they left , making a mighty wall of water spray my face .	but
0	154317	She slit the tape reached into her desk drawer for a pair of latex gloves , which she donned before lifting off the top of the cardboard box .	Put the box down on the table .	and
0	94837	To get out but i havent had anyone to go with .	Go for a while .	and
0	95406	She raised her thin , black wand .	Pointed it towards a large clearing .	and
0	120170	Considered myself a bright guy , and realized we were faced with two viable realities right now : either wed traveled back in time or this was all an elaborate setup by our enemy , one meant to confuse and then inevitably destroy us .	Had taken plenty of philosophy classes in my time .	and
1	2458	Its , the light instantly replied me .	You see what others dont .	because
2	141226	People-watching had taught me to avoid eye contact at most times .	Id missed something important in my observations .	but
2	140320	He looked like he wanted to run .	My infection held him in place - the way i moved , the radiance of my eyes .	but
3	145989	Id say he looked a little spiteful .	I didnt know better .	if
2	53504	Was to risk exposing herself .	Curiosity won over caution .	but
3	1654	She can ' help it .	She jus ' wants t .	if
2	5620	The fact that a branch of the firm was about to produce such results had everyone excited .	The waiting had become worrisome .	but
3	41271	Hey i 'm all ears .	You have a better idea .	if
2	19817	`` they were not my tribe .	They were my clan .	but
3	59062	In all honestly i would have been okay .	A random carjacker would have walked up and shot me in the head to take my van and my purse .	if
3	25745	You can take the escalators up to get to the bus terminal , but they moved it a couple years back when it was expanded .	You get out of the metro station .	if
2	154285	Pinned to his lapel , ritchie from oklahoma .	Youre going to have to go back there and tell mr. douglas fairbanks junior that if he wants our table , the polite thing to do is come over here and ask for it himself .	but
2	135789	She began to fold the paper in half .	I grabbed her arm .	but
2	98018	I wish i could tell you more about this mysterious pilot .	He was badly injured .	but
1	124214	'' roth muttered under his breath .	That would be too easy .	because
1	1563	She was purring at me .	She was pretending to pity me .	because
0	135021	Of all the factions in atlanta , the people and the pack were the largest .	The two i most wanted to avoid .	and
0	12850	What i scrambled to stand in front of him .	Tripped over my suitcase in the process .	and
2	33586	Not to dispel the notion .	To keep her mind from slipping all the way out of reality .	but
4	114823	I asked them to pull over .	We were close to the apartment complex .	when
4	133079	To hone his temper .	Anyone questioned his mental or emotional stability .	when
3	59657	Indeed her breath undoubtedly could have been described as heaving .	Her body had not been crushed under the wheels of ricky cordigans overpriced and oversized vehicle .	if
2	157497	Was going to get .	At least it was something .	but
0	74709	Overcome by her curiosity , she took a deep breath .	Pushed the door open just enough to peek inside .	and
2	20391	Gerald worked an ugly smirk on jamie .	His eyes stared over the detectives left shoulder .	but
2	125180	I thought he was an american .	He was n't . .	but
0	119065	Marisabel turns , biting her bottom lip as though struggling not to cry while vlad looks like he could whistle .	Stares intently at a far corner of the room .	and
1	157707	Shed start to go on at length about how she doesnt approve of such and such couple anymore longstanding friends of theirs .	They engage in premarital sex .	because
0	116077	Felicity loontwill entered the shop .	Wafted over to him in a flutter of raspberry taffeta and a great show of cordiality .	and
4	96655	He took a different tack .	I ran into him at the esfahan hotel bar .	when
2	19793	She wants many grandkids running through these cold hallways .	Children never think of their poor parents .	but
4	2614	I 'd felt pain and that had been worse .	Richard and jean-claude had been hurt .	when
3	143115	The story was their story .	Not embellished a bit with more romanticism than he remembered .	if
0	117651	Despite their agreement about the difficulty of identifying undead in this crowd , neither of them would stand .	Do nothing when a vampire was .	and
2	11247	To maintain a fast pace .	Still listen for men moving either ahead or behind him .	but
4	52221	We saw it . '' .	The image started rolling .	when
4	130006	He heard the winding of gears inside his arms .	He rolled his wrists and the clicking of his body when he breathed .	when
2	10250	I may not return home nearly as often as i should .	I know my grandmother better than just about anyone .	but
0	47157	I sprang at him .	Knocked him to the ground .	and
2	154973	David has lifted again then the head from the gazette .	With a more definite movement and scattante than you/he/she had not made few minutes and you/he/she is inserted in the matter .	but
2	110072	Now it was just screech owls back there sometimes , sometimes she thought maybe it was the ghosts of those women .	How some years before , abortions were done in the backseats of cars in the woods with nothing to kill the pain and .	but
2	15324	Not only were they monitored by a stealth-orbital system .	Their locations were kept a secret , with several decoys .	but
0	83577	He thought he was .	Was surprised that someone was .	and
2	86157	Answered willing to go along with deuce 's unique way of getting around to a point .	Confused by the question .	but
4	133783	Macy found sammy curled up on the welcome mat , his chin resting on his paws .	She reached her front porch .	when
2	109309	It was only the marking for a young water elf .	It made her feel self-conscious .	but
3	155453	Jesus , just get me the nuggets , frank threw his paws in the air .	Youre going to make a big deal out of it .	if
0	122378	They were not very nice , by the way , wild parties at all hours .	They let their dogs do not good things in our front yard and never cleaned it up .	and
4	79999	I had to ask him .	Was the last time you actually saw them .	when
4	32277	For all its weight , it rocked .	He applied pressure to it .	when
3	49171	... a gamble , but what other choice did he have .	They went around to check out the back of the house .	if
3	95392	There was no way it could lead to the outside , and then she 'd have proof .	She followed the same path she 'd taken in the dream .	if
3	128249	I would 've turned bright red .	I had any capacity left for embarrassment .	if
2	3445	`` chill factor '' running in sand was twice as tiring as on a flat surface .	I relished the burn .	but
2	67428	She could be so cutting .	I thought i might just have the upper hand .	but
2	85915	Ares , for instance , was the first underlander to fall .	He shows remarkable resistance .	but
2	16754	I reach up to hold him around the neck .	He resists me , sitting up .	but
0	81110	He eased the door open .	Strode to the bed .	and
2	148906	I didnt want to do anything closed and feel the hot air blow across my skinthe perfect reversal to the cold death id been living through .	Lie there with my eyes .	but
0	114352	Shield wise , jay had completed the actual shape of the shield .	Had started putting spells on it using his books .	and
2	32465	I smiled , warming at his compliments . '' .	Said quietly to him , `` i appreciate the vote of confidence , but no one can hear you but me .	but
4	94865	I was walking out .	I heard her ask asa if he had seen her daughter .	when
0	129025	A spark that was equal parts fear .	Understanding flared in mason 's eyes .	and
4	76430	Traelorg can kill a shadow .	It 's a shadow .	when
0	10023	Gomez and ying were common surnames .	Molot was not infrequent , so i looked for konova .	and
0	91397	She touched my cock , bending it down .	It came to life .	and
4	25229	The weed-spirits dont die , they just go .	We uproot the weeds .	when
2	27684	It 's very strange .	I feel like i 've known her an age instead of a day .	but
2	25832	No one seemed particularly jovial .	There was a nice buzz of conversation going on .	but
2	28266	You do not like .	In punishing dortak before all , he was telling his people you rule at his side .	but
0	51705	She gets up , closing it behind herself and locking me in .	Heads for the door .	and
3	48054	They may have possibly killed hundreds of people , including government forces .	They had pressed on with the kidnap and subsequent suicide bombing at the same mosque .	if
2	1405	Langdon 's mouth went bone dry .	He managed a polite smile as the woman joined him .	but
0	37172	I wore my belt with an array of herbs in small pouches , my leather wrist guards were full of silver needles , and my second saber , which i wore on my hip .	I had taken both slayer , which was on my .	and
4	153057	And , rachel very practically handed sarah a scrapbook of the cheatin ' hearts death watch , which was more complete and informative than the dossier stargazer could have compiled with any amount of digging .	Sarah asked rachel to fill her in on recent events .	when
1	101325	Even when he 'd been pushing her away he had always thought of her as his .	She 'd been so determined to be his .	because
4	75714	He 'd shrugged me off .	I 'd asked him .	when
3	88597	On the bright side at least they issued you a phone that works over here . '' .	We 're looking for a bright side .	if
0	73818	He was researching portals , how to use this knowledge .	Trying to figure out .	and
3	130933	You can even spit a cornnut right through them .	You get it going .	if
4	75546	He 'd felt something , something he never had before.something that confused him .	He 'd kissed her .	when
2	136546	It 's a different kind of danger now , and .	It 's even more potent .	but
2	107115	It might nah look lacka forest .	Trust mi , deh are days when yuh could swear it was .	but
4	111029	You 're usually a decent driver that is .	You 're not crashing into angels .	when
3	134594	He knows the ride is only open to him if he has the clearance . '' .	A driver is free to take the ride and sees this .	if
2	13064	The first few miles of the road were dual carriageway , which helped her confidence a little .	Then the road became two-way again and she slowed to about twenty miles an hour .	but
0	114565	It was barely midmorning , had all the laundry washed and hanging in the drying room , dusted the furniture , and swept the floors .	She 'd already made a casserole , cleaned up the kitchen , stripped the beds and put on fresh linens .	and
2	101445	Helmut to tell in the dark .	The dunce did look relieved .	but
0	54265	Dragging him to the ground .	Shoving ashlyn from his head .	and
2	57562	He pulled the cord .	The mower didnt come to life .	but
2	7612	I spoke with him earlier this morning .	He knew little of jennas daily routine .	but
1	135613	My language is malayalam .	I am from kerala .	because
0	105108	To break down their tents .	To obliterate any footprints that might alert the soldiers to the fact that someone had spent the night in this secluded place .	and
4	138129	He went on hurriedly and with apparent composure , i am not confounded by the wagging of their heads ; for everyone knows everything about it already , and all that is secret is made open .	Both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the innkeeper smiled '' no matter .	when
0	94613	The rage in his eyes died to smoldering amber .	He stood before me , relaxed , loose , and calm .	and
0	20483	When the hearse came to halt .	Then started reversing down the lane .	and
3	110103	That meant she had an affair with damon .	That was his baby , and dreamer was a month pregnant before she died .	if
2	968	Id tell you to look at what youve done .	You wont see it .	but
0	128862	The club was warm packed with bodies , and .	The music was to die for .	and
2	7707	Sylvie taught the boys piano herself for a while , drawing from her ten years of lessons .	Scott immediately lost interest .	but
2	33780	I shake it off and .	Grab my phone from my back pocket .	but
2	75284	Above him he heard voices .	Nothing was making sense .	but
2	120652	He went back out to the field to drive the tractor came in late while we were asleep and woke lenny .	We 'd all gone to bed except papa , and .	but
0	99474	To make the rider swerve .	Spoil his aim for his next shot .	and
4	44209	It was bitten by a felokar wolf .	I challenged them to combat .	when
0	47552	You invest just one dollar ? ' .	Wait for - how long , mr bent .	and
3	55278	I was going to lose our witness .	He jarred my mind .	if
0	20667	It knocked the old pirate .	Nearly made him add his own body to the pile-on behind him .	and
4	5696	I hated my daughter .	I believed her to have run away , perhaps to the city .	when
4	113744	It apparently changed due to some sort of eighteenth century tourist gimmick .	The villagers realised that they could cash in on the tourist potential if they had the battle renamed .	when
4	135927	Burnett repeated , `` show me the damn picture ! '' .	Della and chase sat there glaring at each other .	when
2	3562	Rosa and jilla heard it .	Went right back to sleep .	but
2	119793	I felt stiff and sluggish .	I stretched out anyway , preparing to at least trip around the track until i hit a mile .	but
2	110623	His methods are strange . ' '' .	Perhaps it is what is needed .	but
2	96288	The thought instilled a fierce ache in the deepest recesses of her soul not for one moment would she regret being with him .	Oh , she knew their time was drawing to an end , and .	but
4	44437	Why you were always so willing to do that for me .	I never gave it .	when
0	93781	The princess wore a short , pale-green dryad tunic .	There was a smudge of ash on one of her cheeks .	and
0	100249	Claws formed swiftly as we approached .	A hundred-foot swath of the enemy died in that first sweep .	and
2	55404	I 'll increase your fee of course ! '' .	I need you to stay and oversee the next phase o ' the operation .	but
4	94428	I did the same for him , concentrating on his sculpted chest .	He finished washing me .	when
2	11261	Simple beasts they may be : they knew where they were .	Each whiskered face betrayed a glimmer of dread .	but
0	349	I stiffened as a flare of ever-after shot through me .	My eyes opened at trent 's hiss .	and
0	62133	To call the science team .	Tell them to drive out to where were landing .	and
4	1618	He sat back in his chair and didnt attempt to talk to her .	They finished with five minutes left in the class .	when
2	49243	Myself wanting her fingers .	I get up quickly before my brother gets the wrong idea .	but
3	116087	You 'll be the first person she 'll find .	She 's in need of a hug .	if
4	115015	He had to do that at home .	He had his barn at least but he only had to clean up after two horses .	when
1	97836	Pretending that the life he 'd carved for himself was exactly what he wanted .	Perhaps he was sick .	because
0	56753	Peaches were the most disgusting fruit .	The world would be a better place without them .	and
2	87004	He had installed generators from bahrain to the western deserts of saudi arabia ; nothing like this .	They were temporary , to be used only until electricity could be cabled in .	but
0	128902	Thatcher tells us to do things for ourselves .	Has grants to help .	and
2	34063	The applause seems to go on .	Eventually the stage manager lowers the curtain , and the entire cast gives a huge cheer of self-congratulation .	but
0	81879	Cronus sighed , `` my words yesterday were purely my own , not a reflection of what kate expressed .	Said in an annoyed voice .	and
4	89397	To pull out more , stopping her .	Rose put a hand on her arm .	when
0	117395	The atlanteans are trapped slaughtered .	Atlantean archers give cover for their infantry , but .	and
2	133818	Not only would the world know about dallas .	His family never thought for a minute that he would become the man that he became .	but
4	42	He started to cough .	He opened his eyes , and he could see his foster father frantically trying to resuscitate him .	when
2	23871	Maybe i should have been outraged .	Mostly i felt jealous .	but
3	61810	It might never come .	He didnt take the opportunity .	if
0	111081	She tried to reach past it , churning with unfamiliar violence .	Glimpsed a hint of a form .	and
2	115409	The idea sounded crazy .	Maybe his blood was .	but
2	153520	The thoughts of his mother and father lying to him his entire life about the existence of the wind warriors .	Even that invasive thought kept creeping back into the forefront of his memories .	but
0	130475	He scuffs the dusty ground with his sandal .	Speaks to me in a worried stutter .	and
3	116277	Uh we could hire you some protection .	You dont mind parting with some of that advance .	if
3	74055	As bill had said she would have to do it herself .	She wanted it painted .	if
0	99505	The cellar was small .	Had a dirt floor with rough , split log walls all .	and
2	157064	The noise echoed through the empty street .	No one came to their window .	but
2	41803	I tried to get down the driveway .	I got hung up .	but
3	94680	They had better be gasping their last breath . '' .	Anyone calls me that week .	if
3	103477	And , youll have to arrest me along with ms. dodd .	You try to stop us .	if
0	135018	Weldon placed six cookies in a sandwich bag .	Took them with him .	and
2	109497	I 'd stopped taking my meds .	I still saw dr. o'connell once a week .	but
0	136186	I yanked him from elder zeller 's grip , which meant elder zeller had been giving him peace .	Antonio instantly started trembling .	and
4	98671	He might have taken marietta into his arms and held her as hed wanted to hold her in the cabin .	They sat closely together on the carson sofa , when marietta took his hand if amys kitchen accident hadnt diverted their attention .	when
4	13947	He was just about to step into it .	He turned to me and grabbed my arm .	when
2	47903	She had not done it , switching the poison with a sleeping draught .	The woman had done many other travesties , which was reason enough why i should keep her whereabouts a secret .	but
1	59043	She 's never noticed me .	She 's always been into kyle .	because
2	19015	Immortalised in plastic and print we may have been .	The world was determined to carry on as if we were ordinary , less than ordinary .	but
3	153082	`` , my lord , which i very much doubt , you would know what kind of affection i mean .	You have ever been in a war .	if
0	50241	He looked at the two of them .	Commanded hold out your hands .	and
4	150945	In some half-forgotten time a light-hearted wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed .	He had still been a hobbit .	when
4	88293	To go to lunch .	Someone whirled into the room .	when
2	84358	The paw was for wishing .	The price you paid for each of your three wishes was a black one .	but
0	143081	Mathew 's green eyes widen .	He quickly tries to turn away before sylas can see he 's healing .	and
3	9813	I could only imagine what happened when he got on stage with his band .	He could do this to me .	if
4	140868	I 'd find the assassin .	I found the little girl .	when
4	21610	He 'll never want you again . '' .	I 'm done with you .	when
2	54555	Green didnt believe in coincidences any more than he believed that the guilty went unpunished .	In any case the scorched number plate on the back of the wreck confirmed to him that the most recent clients of wilderness tours had met an unscheduled halt in their trip at this point .	but
2	137774	Her material might be funny .	She was n't . .	but
2	98279	When you did , valentine was bound .	You and valentine arrived yesterday and . '' .	but
0	69999	A uniformed man nodded at mr. grimsby , and mr. grimsby led me up to the house .	Opened the gate for us without looking at me .	and
4	14883	To realize what this meant .	She felt ronan grab her from .	when
2	98399	Ibardia said nothing to that , merely studied him .	She still carried the earlier flush in her cheeks .	but
0	112582	While lodestok gulped rather than sipped his wine , the reader 's eyes opened .	Lodestok saw they held the oddest expression he 'd ever seen in jaden 's eyes .	and
4	54309	The boy 's family will probably not bother him .	They see that he is sleeping .	when
2	83568	Daniel had callie 's suitcase hoisted up over his shoulder .	It was cam who was leaning in , smiling , his hand on callie 's right forearm as he chatted with her .	but
3	26593	You would never forgive yourself and decided it was a mistake .	We slept together in the heat of the moment and i woke up the next morning .	if
0	148351	It maneuvered around us sped off .	Joey started to pull over , but .	and
2	122288	I have encountered attractive women and even some with wonderful souls .	None of them have ever compared to you .	but
4	111909	What they intended ? '' .	They siphoned off your blood .	when
0	44159	He had certainly not intended to drink so much the previous night , but the knowledge that it would soon be all gone had somehow translated itself in his fuddled mind into a compulsion to drink it all before it got away from him .	The knowledge that he was reaching the bottom of his last cask of arcian red had worried at him as he had grown progressively drunker .	and
2	75728	I knew things were rough with them .	This was for cc .	but
4	118296	How bad have things gotten .	Churches have become targets .	when
2	12574	He grinned down at her .	His eyes showed a different story .	but
2	90461	She did not expect him to back out .	At that moment she knew richard no longer belonged to her .	but
0	93879	When his son was born .	The infant 's cries filled the room .	and
0	94527	They remounted and there with groves of trees .	Rode on up out of the pass onto a hilly plateau dotted .	and
2	108522	The men closed in on miles .	He was now staring at the floor , body mostly motionless except he was breathing .	but
2	63086	I lift up to get a better view , wondering if the scenery has changed any .	It has n't . .	but
2	25921	There was only a subtle change .	This was my number one most favorite sleeping position with vance .	but
4	9658	And , she had felt totally empty .	She had finally fallen .	when
0	62931	They snarled because all men were traitorous brothers , but the female intercepted them .	Rushed forward to attack the man .	and
2	602	One of my freshman composition classes had a debate about the military after the tribune story appeared . '' .	That 's about it .	but
0	64100	I would also talk to carl .	Explain just how dire this was .	and
2	22603	She had been listening to the clone 's private thoughts .	Her telepathic invasion only confirmed his assessment of her identity in his mind .	but
0	142990	Belle heard the blood rushing to her ears .	Wondered if you could fight back a stroke .	and
0	93088	The same men in australia and then in combat against the japanese but his coffee was wearing off .	His thoughts continued to wander back to his own struggle .	and
0	155703	Navani arrived , then started reading .	Looked over the letter .	and
0	63888	She 's one of us now . '' .	Whereas we would rip someone 's throat out for her , she is willing to do the same for us .	and
2	113192	You may not want to hear this .	I need you to know .	but
3	51290	Galloped for the ball .	Its life depended on it .	if
4	19349	In a day once and still , nothing .	Dr. miletus said i was totally fertile .	when
2	1771	I 'd picked up the spanner .	Now i hurled it across the room and heard it clang off the stage .	but
3	98069	More easily and the blade is at your side .	Your arms are locked in battle .	if
2	130629	Now he stood away from the ring of contestants , taking his aim from the back of carlys head , and .	Waived his weapon about in front of him .	but
0	19921	If it was not for him we would not have made it .	Would have perished with the rest of the crew and slaves .	and
2	48860	Sex had always been a thrill .	Right now he stood on the peak of a tall mountain ready to fly .	but
0	15445	The gate shut behind her .	Went looking for simon .	and
3	149037	What , without knowing the pigeon was under it , unable to escape .	The owner of that car came out and drove .	if
0	139563	Once changed , these spirits could be released into reality .	Denied their rightful existence in the spirit world unless defeated .	and
2	49519	We have no trace of her at present , although our exertions to discover her are unremitted .	They will not restore my beloved wilma .	but
4	96783	The drawer was empty .	They got to the morgue .	when
0	107565	He took her arms from his shoulders , she thought , but the touch still made this cold , sterile room feel as if it glowed with warmth .	Held her hands in his-only a gesture .	and
0	80485	Giddeon grinned after delivering his complement .	Tipped back his corona .	and
2	95641	We also have a lot of engineering versions in service , and .	The two aboard my vessel are just that .	but
3	5507	Some will gladly come and visit .	They know there are no humans .	if
0	125979	Rhyllann settled into cruise mode , keeping clear of other small aerodromes .	Avoiding raf bases like the plague .	and
0	26586	The inside of the cupboard was also present .	It was in that shadowy , paper-smelling recess that she kept the stars .	and
0	104768	There was a delay .	It would be one more day before i could move in .	and
2	73071	I held my weapon out , wanting to pull the trigger .	Wondering in the back of my mind who once loved them , who might be unaffected and be at home , barricaded in the house , perhaps even calling their cell phones wondering why they werent answering , but fearing no , knowing the worst had happened .	but
2	701	It should have been afraid of her , should have bowed to her .	Had probably sensed her fear and reacted , racing straight for her , hungry for her living flesh .	but
0	84623	What was left of the mirror .	Slowly made a deeper cut on her shoulder .	and
2	30326	Hoping he still had time .	Knowing at the same time that he was deceiving himself .	but
1	156363	I couldnt find the resolve to kick against the current .	Despite everything , i still wanted him with a passion that overcame reason .	because
2	44392	God , aly , when you were here last week , i knew you were hurting .	I had no idea how much you were dealing with .	but
2	119864	The corridor was too narrow for two people to walk side by side .	Smith was close behind her , pistol in hand .	but
0	22523	Distracted , every wall , a foreign conscience invaded mine .	Every barrier around my mind seemed to fall .	and
2	94531	Well , he didnt really know that for a fact , hadnt asked anyone to confirm it .	It was widely rumored , common knowledge , as it were , especially amongst the kids .	but
1	125694	If you ever do something like this again , get hurt , i will kill you myself .	You 're getting the fucking shot .	because
3	31713	I wont kill you .	You wont kill me deal .	if
4	115851	Who 'd been sparring with liv in the courtyard in rim .	They 'd first arrived .	when
0	153579	`` no doubt about that , '' he said , taking my hand .	Leading me toward the throne room .	and
2	13502	Some had nothing on them bits of shaving soap , but .	There were wet snots and big boogies in some of the others .	but
0	49621	But yesterday he yelled at nurse dempster for forgetting to put out an instrument .	Today i heard him yelling at dr. shortt .	and
2	43660	The man should have a familial resemblance to beros .	That 's a wide area to cover .	but
0	158111	Then a small burst of warm air enveloped her body .	She found herself sitting in the sand , looking out across turquoise waves .	and
3	118492	Why would he go to such lengths ? '' .	All he wanted to do was make slade look bad .	if
0	151393	At grantworth house the hackney pulled up at the curb by a yawning barth .	Victoria and verbena slipped down and onto the walk .	and
0	75779	Suddenly the ghost lurched .	Threw up all over kylie 's shoulder .	and
1	103799	Frank wanted to make an important bust .	It would look good .	because
4	62891	The money was in your brothers pickup truck .	He questioned her at the trailer park .	when
1	44538	I dont really get the point of making a vin de primeur of a white wine .	By the time the season is right for it its regular wine .	because
2	121501	Thought i was skilled with scalpel and forceps .	You put me to shame with your ability to tease a body into so many perfect anatomical sections .	but
4	27719	Vinca sat on the couch .	I got back the apartment .	when
4	43577	Dr. parker said , `` renee , i need you to concentrate . '' .	Renee did not respond .	when
0	136304	My throat was on fire .	My head was pounding .	and
4	41662	Walter must have confronted him .	He received the report .	when
0	77443	He walked down to the boulders he 'd chosen for shelter stringing the powder-primed fuse cord lit the fuse with the last ember .	Hunkered down behind the rocks .	and
1	36874	I spent most of my money on the rent .	I wanted to be in a nicer area of the city .	because
2	103526	What she had previously told him .	Which also explained some of the confusing parts of the story karen had pieced .	but
2	55976	They have scheduled another meeting for next month . '' .	Our answer will remain unchanged .	but
4	135117	I barked out a laugh .	I saw his shirt .	when
4	118028	I fire into the intersection , and the meat grinder activates .	Everyone 's joined me .	when
0	74325	He could see the spaces between atoms .	A deep sadness filled him without apparent cause .	and
0	103007	He went to sit in front of me .	Gave a happy yip .	and
4	104038	As always i think of the day she died .	I think of her birthday .	when
2	78312	She was in a wide street .	There were no cross streets .	but
2	104655	I did not know what to make of any of this .	It made me feverish with theories .	but
4	84689	So i come here . '' .	I need to be humbled .	when
4	66369	You believed in me .	I didnt even believe in myself .	when
3	114863	`` , they can get sick .	People stare at paintings .	if
1	41652	Put her foot on the bike petal .	Her entire body was trembling .	because
2	116678	When i looked directly at him , he immediately averted his eyes .	I was certain hed been talking about me .	but
0	23918	Unable to dig them into the dirt , they positioned rocks to act as fulcrums .	Planted a foot on the blunt side to keep them angled .	and
4	109955	He saw her eyes were rolling up into her head and her legs were collapsing under her .	He reached out to give it to her .	when
1	34997	She threw caution to the wind .	It was unlikely she would ever see him .	because
0	119777	It has no straps .	You can easily get into it .	and
0	34278	What was left after the fire was clean and tidy .	All of the furniture was .	and
0	141739	He managed to break his fall .	Landed with a roll to his knees .	and
0	147623	He agreed that the other younger gods would lend aphrael some of their children .	He went to chyrellos to ask dolmant to offer sanctuary to aphrael 's surviving worshipers .	and
2	62606	He had grown up on the streets .	He 'd had mack and jaimie and the others as a family .	but
0	107987	They stopped in the center .	Pivoted toward the class .	and
0	137059	He seized her finger .	Held it against his chest as she tried to tug it .	and
4	142459	You two are most powerful .	You put your wits and strengths .	when
4	52497	My mother and father had been murdered .	I was a child .	when
2	30028	She 'd bought it for the store .	Had wanted to keep it for herself .	but
2	132468	He had never needed to study in high school .	Found himself spending a lot of time hitting the books .	but
0	100623	When the depth of sibyl 's emotions and her lovemaking with colin finally stole over her , letting sleep take her .	She relaxed against him .	and
2	132697	She shocked most of the women .	I was fascinated , especially with all of tristan 's talk of restraints .	but
2	43726	When they said something nice to him .	Were thinking something cruel .	but
4	90911	I still get hot around the ears .	I remember that particular expression .	when
0	37999	A blush stole up her neck .	Flushed her cheeks a soft pink .	and
0	140543	There might be a way to free your dad although , it ll be kind of difficult .	We have to do a little bit more research , but .	and
4	26075	Why you 're taking adam out .	You 've been leaving him with me for weeks .	when
2	29124	Loren and i separated .	He stayed close to me .	but
0	128277	June 21 , saturday 11:30 a.m. woodlawn memorial gardens kathy santos , dressed in black , walked slowly toward the open grave .	Tossed a single rose into the deep dank hole .	and
0	118244	He breathed a sigh of relief .	Continued , anticipating that she was most likely a refugee from the alamo .	and
0	94605	I paused at the edge , twisted .	Fired my crossbow back up at the mansion .	and
3	569	We have the upper hand .	Everyone thinks you 're dead .	if
4	154401	We could always what , turn him into a hybrid so that the rest of the world can think hes an abomination .	He gets to a certain age .	when
3	41477	You can raise an entire cemetery .	You cant control them and send them back to their graves youre going to get everyone killed .	if
2	2785	I 'm sorry , lee . '' .	That 's the way it is .	but
0	94323	Then she threw with her left hand .	Fought her whoop of triumph as the blade sank into the handle of another dagger .	and
0	36373	Paris 's hair was multihued .	Each of those hues gleamed .	and
2	30696	Al of which were petty punishments .	When added together and carried on for long periods of time would leave her exhausted and despairing of a life of such steady , smal tortures .	but
4	110982	She told him she 'd thought about him that night .	They met again at the lake .	when
2	101089	`` i would go myself .	My arthritis is driving me nuts .	but
0	108007	Which had probably been in place for at least a thousand years .	Most of the city 's buildings showed a similar antiquity .	and
0	26321	The alien 's cool haughtiness made gregg 's temper flare .	Puppetman rose with the irritation .	and
2	112379	It was very quiet and serene , with a tiny view of the mountains through a small window .	It became as famous as a single bathroom .	but
2	42206	Slicked the street outside .	A light drizzle of rain beaded on the glass and .	but
0	91162	I pull us down to our knees .	We practice for hours for our first meeting-our first kiss .	and
0	69864	They had remained in the garden to hold their low-voiced discussion .	Temeraire now observed , in faintly wistful tones , `` it does sound like a very great deal of gold .	and
2	87184	He had told jabal that he could use her as templar bait ; it was as simple and as complicated as that .	He wrote in his journal that he liked to have her with him .	but
4	67718	Waving a pointy stick .	Faced by a gorilla .	when
4	69711	Plus well get a reward , and i can buy you all the tuna you want .	We hand him over .	when
0	98356	For a moment , the entire world slows .	Takes on a green hue .	and
0	21846	His fire-whisperer veil was .	Verica saw his true face .	and
4	88362	Smacking the thing in the face .	It tried to bite him .	when
0	143747	He opened his eyes .	Found himself staring at a faceless black head , inches beyond his nose , and screamed again , recoiling as best he could .	and
0	121718	I let you come this .	You almost ruined things with those riders .	and
0	133820	She took a deep breath .	Pulled at the ends of her weave .	and
3	71369	He will be able to use its powers .	It is given to him .	if
4	50007	The cream smearing across her lips , he 'd had to turn away before he rushed in and hauled her out .	He 'd peeked into the tea tent and seen her closing her mouth around the profiterole .	when
3	147590	It would be on the side of caution .	He had to err .	if
0	123	They are ugly . '' .	I have done a lot of ugly , rachel .	and
3	34172	She would misread his intentions .	He turned and walked away , or got angry .	if
3	32155	Nothing like i describe it .	It does , let me just say , what a cool town .	if
0	127407	They screamed in unison .	Reached for the buckets .	and
0	91868	She then got up from the couch .	Sat next to me on the coffee table .	and
1	58547	She became a writer .	She wanted more money at a young age and because she wanted freedom .	because
1	85310	Only to remove them days .	All they could smell throughout the house was popcorn .	because
0	35417	He raised his musket .	Took aim between the spread antlers .	and
4	58252	Gnak was happy to see the look on his face .	He realized what it was he was seeing .	when
4	71090	The day would eventually come .	She would have to submit to her fathers wishes .	when
0	155902	I stifle a smile , stroke the star on his wrist , giving him a quick kiss .	Graze his lips with mine .	and
3	100151	He felt he could hear something .	He drew close to them .	if
0	125872	When i turn my head .	Look in the direction of the doorway .	and
0	12109	He hopped silently onto the other end of the tree trunk .	Said , `` why do you cry , girl ? '' .	and
4	439	To make a wish .	You blow out your candles .	when
2	146493	Vib consulted with its union representatives -- who complained mightily about the change in the work load just when they all had families to raise .	They ultimately signed the contract .	but
2	94094	He almost pulled the blankets .	Pushed himself through the cabin door .	but
0	13114	Even spring had arrived .	The trees and weeds were in full bloom .	and
2	13182	He planned to get out in less .	Then died of a heart attack during the first 10 years of his sentence .	but
0	92162	The moment i pressed the crescent .	Let myself into ravenwood manor .	and
2	57233	Hate losin ' you .	You got ta shift off me , honey .	but
0	28658	Sighing in defeat , i shrugged off my leather jacket - which i knew she loved a little too much so i wore it all the more .	Hung it over the wardrobe door that was wide open .	and
0	79671	He swiped a claw across his lips .	Stalked after the chaos with murder in his eyes .	and
0	98892	With more confidence , cathy stepped .	Walked back to the chair .	and
0	28278	The men had arrived in their huge truck .	Soon the shack the little family called home was ablaze and her sister and father were no longer of this world .	and
0	61415	When the cage jerked to a halt , jon swung down onto the ground .	Rattled longclaw 's hilt to loosen the bastard blade in its scabbard .	and
1	59287	That had been felled by beavers .	The women had no iron tools to cut and plane the wood .	because
0	80507	Earl sat up , as if he could still look cool sitting on the gym floor .	Pulled on the collar of his jacket to straighten it .	and
0	58284	He nodded she saw him work to pull back his discontent .	Burnett frowned at the mention of her grandfather , but .	and
0	121713	She was actually serious .	The chain at his neck confirmed it .	and
0	44096	Tomaz himself ate nearly half the animal , enormous though it was .	Looked as though he stopped himself from eating more .	and
1	156498	The goal for tonight , to be postponed to another night if no decision was reached , was to figure out how to preserve all this art .	Leaving the paintings as they were , exposed to the cold and damp , was going to result in permanent damage .	because
0	152487	Link opens his eyes .	Finds himself in the forest .	and
4	81314	It suddenly dawned on henrietta .	She had walked all the way into the hall that she would likely be doing a lot of waiting tonight .	when
3	35150	Scuba diving can be hard work .	Especially you are fighting a strong current to stay below the boat .	if
2	59900	Antonietta obviously viewed it as a tourist restaurant .	The two of them had to admit that the peasant style fare was interesting , and the boisterous crowd made for a festive evening that seemed to fit with the revelations they had discovered earlier in the day .	but
0	42263	Who would be faithful .	Love her for the rest of his life .	and
0	62846	I made myself visible for a while .	My gray skin showed .	and
4	53019	A shudder went through her .	She felt his heavy , warm cock drop into the widened crack of her ass .	when
2	151480	The camp moving around outside i stayed there for a moment , picking out bits of conversation , listening to voices drift through the walls .	Getting ready to head out .	but
2	10205	Mom and dad would have come .	They 're off sailing with dylan for a couple of days .	but
3	31150	The sky was so blue and wide open , she wondered .	She could see up to heaven .	if
1	40799	Everyone nearly laughed their sides .	Everyone knew that elise grandeaux was his mistress until the day he died .	because
0	48180	The lu roared in anger .	Cocking back her arm shay lofted the pot of nasty witch 's brew directly into the bloody wound .	and
2	10886	As far as i can determine , he worked on some advertisements for the telly .	Wanted to eventually make flicks .	but
0	59490	Anyway-i touched his face got his blood on me .	I think isabelle must have clawed him , but . '' .	and
2	37439	She was not looking at him now , and hearing his voice in her ear , and it had all seemed like a dream at the time , moments drawn out of real life , as if they were taking place in some other world .	Seeing the firelight against the walls of the cave .	but
2	37000	All things considered , we could have done without these cozy get-togethers .	Our grandmother insisted on having all of us .	but
4	2134	His mother had bought him .	He 'd moved in .	when
2	51696	The first man swung his gun stealthily down from his shoulder , reaching for rod and cartridge .	One of the others stopped him with a hand on his arm .	but
1	28628	He 's blaming himself , and he was never there for you to see nor save you from whatever happened .	He thinks that something must have occurred in your childhood to lead to this .	because
2	110742	Isabella started to answer . '' .	Jason turned ( again ) and corrected ( again ) , `` ambidextrous .	but
1	38632	If you believe castor , he trained her .	It was kinder than kicking her out on her own .	because
1	13011	Then he must 've said something funny .	She laughs and puts her hand on his chest .	because
2	81064	The form was a heat signature .	It was still too faint to be sure if we were perceiving what we saw .	but
0	159109	He continued to choke his brother while jhovahkans face turned red .	His eyes began to bulge out of their sockets .	and
4	66872	He was so taken by the beauty of the area that he affixed his name to many sites , including isla coln ( columbus island ) , isla san cristbal ( saint christopher island ) and baha de almirante ( admirals bay .	Christopher columbus visited bocas del toro in 1502 during his fourth and final new world voyage .	when
3	133247	I 'd be lucky .	I ever spoke to him .	if
0	42871	This man is my patient .	He is under my orders and care .	and
2	101523	She needed the job badly and , prompting lacey to hire her .	Lacey knew exactly what the desperation she saw in serena 's eyes felt like .	but
0	41083	He was too quick to use the black magic he kept trying to kill the very people i needed to survive .	Thought i might have loved him once , but .	and
2	134784	His entire left forearm had become a shell filled with molten lead , causing blistering on the outside of the skin .	He made it through .	but
0	156252	Look down at your feet , thomas delvecchio .	Then you call me when you get scared .	and
2	6557	All right , go if you have to . '' .	Know that i 'll be here waiting when you 're ready to come .	but
2	46083	Foster was the son bubba had never had .	Even more than that foster was the enthusiasm of youth which bubba had never really felt .	but
0	58928	I 'll need scarpa 's permission to set up shop here . ' .	I 'm not going to go anywhere near him to ask for it .	and
1	96653	Chapter eleven japtan show his thanks to his heavenly father .	All we were not caught converging outside when warned to go for sleep .	because
2	9182	Then you go up the stairs .	Watch out for bernie .	but
2	68571	My boarding-house is down pearl street .	Thats the first place theyll look for me .	but
4	79886	*** katie norman was listening attentively to her lecturer .	She heard a disturbance behind her .	when
0	102757	I 'm one woman who can find bodies .	I never claimed to be more .	and
2	13708	It would have been deeper and it flew across the floor into the dark of the room .	The girl on bottom with the dangling arm had wrenched the weapon away mid slice .	but
2	125288	I should 've already left the house .	I really had no place to go and ... and i wanted to see them .	but
4	44376	The engine gave an aggressive grunt .	He put his foot down on the gas .	when
0	111394	To go back to maiwenn .	Consult her on this .	and
0	101820	He put his gloves back on .	Picked up the box of gene spheres .	and
0	84124	He went for sonia 's wrist .	Demanded to the room at large .	and
2	155880	You 're the lead on this investigation . '' .	I 'm going to put everyone on it .	but
4	101665	We were all still lit up .	We hit orlando 's city limits .	when
0	2976	He begins to feel a personal connection to the tiger .	Wonders if he feels it .	and
0	46385	We haggled about it for an hour or .	Pol 's eyes got flintier by the moment .	and
4	12407	To get some information about pythonand .	I still refused hehe shot me .	when
0	33901	Jumping up from her seat .	Backing away from the spill .	and
1	160336	I 'd let her .	I 'd be helpless against her charms .	because
4	154529	Hank came around from the other side and smiled .	I sat down at the east bar .	when
2	58079	Before he left the garden the hour of the bell came , and .	He heard the shivering clang deafening above him , and the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by the gates .	but
4	39329	Who forgets about her best friend .	She gets a boyfriend .	when
2	121861	I was in control .	The shift of power in this form hung on the tiniest thread of thought .	but
1	142147	I also start the tour here , like that of a ghost from a cartoon .	... his voice adopted a quavering quality .	because
0	136331	She paused for a moment .	Then breathed a long slow breath over the boy 's face .	and
2	136336	They used the one towel to wash off as best they could .	A lack of shower for that many days resulted in discomfort .	but
2	73848	Suella had offered to send for her by paying the airfare .	No , jillian would have none of that .	but
0	154061	Our vast supplies and resources have all been preserved .	Since we have been studying the effects of a solar minimum for several decades we are prepared with all the weapons of antiquity .	and
2	1071	This lack of comprehension was not from lack of intelligence , he had always been considered one of the smartest kids in his class .	He was devoting all of his attention to summer wallburn , who was recognized in most circles as the prettiest girl in the sixth grade .	but
3	144483	Spencer wondered , but even if she did yvette simply held up brady 's arms and clapped them together , smiling proudly at her husband .	Yvette knew that her husband was a letch .	if
2	22496	For caliburs sake she endured and her despair grew even as she clung to life .	Did not turn back to the void .	but
2	87027	Oh , she still felt his presence , still longed for his company .	Those feelings were presently masked with exasperation .	but
4	152799	I went straight home .	I got off work .	when
2	73284	Dinah and lucy warned muriall might appear .	Jessie was not ready for it .	but
3	104922	She may tel her kin and the male .	The male made a good impression .	if
0	52895	They are quite comfortable .	Also have all the facilities necessary to care for a patient .	and
4	57374	Youre a man of honor .	You give your word .	when
2	122481	I destroyed the radio in the process .	At that point i didnt really care about the radio .	but
4	86000	I abandoned the wine to buzz him in .	The buzzer sounded from the intercom on my wall .	when
4	59615	You take away the person .	You take away memories .	when
0	45082	Besides , they are d'albret 's men .	They know too well the punishment that will be exacted if they fail to stop us .	and
2	131349	It was tiring , no doubt about it : it required only practice before she perfected it .	She realized it was like any other effort .	but
2	86545	Her hair is black and straight .	In the light i see that it is streaked with gray .	but
2	69333	The bodice was covered with silvery flowers .	Then the empire waist fell directly to the floor with delicate lines of more silver flowers flowing down .	but
2	31493	She was growing exceedingly warm .	Found she did not have the heart to reject a one of their offerings .	but
0	15826	Logan stayed behind at the kraggers , so i gave him the keys to the mustang .	Offered to give my sisters a ride home .	and
3	144151	My gods will never reincarnate me .	I dont prove to them that youre still the enemy .	if
2	70671	`` we 're not sure .	Your kind is so much closer to nature than the vampirian bloodline and all its created .	but
2	13325	Old man winters thick eyebrows moved .	It was the only sign of motion on his face other than some faint curling on his lips as he spoke .	but
1	46574	Whatever , if i would not see her in my eyes , so much the better .	She could wake my inside monster .	because
4	17324	To dump all over you .	I 'm sure it 's the last thing you need .	when
2	113353	Alanna was clearly struggling to pull the heavy weight behind her .	Was too proud to say anything about it .	but
0	158718	The first was that at least six hours had passed , because she could wriggle her toes and her fingers .	Those movements were enough to tell her that all of her weapons had been removed .	and
4	77134	`` , aye . '' .	It suits your purposes .	when
1	85442	Then i 'm really sorry .	Up against the wall or door while he 's between your knees , one leg slung over his shoulder is .	because
1	90943	But we have to keep quiet about it .	The elders were clear .	because
4	4184	To be the cutting edge leader in the new industry .	Oil inevitably fell into disuse .	when
0	92931	The wine was potent .	Pigafetta had trouble descending the ladder when it came time to leave .	and
0	30011	Jo noticed my expression .	Nodded again-you deserved that-but kept talking .	and
0	130296	But nothing happened next .	They lapsed back into waiting .	and
4	104365	I suppose all traces of them were erased .	It was time to move to another region .	when
0	91689	Her face had blanked .	She was pressing the cloth to sonia 's forehead .	and
2	103472	The possibility that she might run into mason while she was in summer river had occurred to her .	She had dismissed it as extremely remote .	but
2	140037	I recalled a few of my most recent interactions with him .	Couldnt pinpoint any particular evidence that made me doubt his ulterior ambitions .	but
0	153860	The family of the boy offered many ears of dried maize , five turkeys , and a yellow-green feathered belt , along with endless prayers , to ah-kawil .	Because of this , and perhaps because the boys lineage-father is strong in the keeping of the holy days , the soul of the boy entered into the garden of the gods and did not become a wretched slave to ah-puchs servants .	and
2	62474	When her friend reached them , she tried to grab tam 's arm .	Her ghostly hand went right through .	but
3	91035	You come up with some very funny ideas .	You sit down and think about it .	if
2	58244	Ta remember , the first time i met her was in lifeblood .	Then she came to my apartment-jackson porter 's apartment-right after i woke up there , and she looked basically the same .	but
4	126820	I 'd never felt it stronger than in that moment .	Elizabeth had backed me into a corner with that expression on her face .	when
2	8425	There 's no dress code . '' .	You 'll get the picture .	but
2	4800	Nanto raised a hand .	Her warning cry stuck in her throat as queen nuada charged , eyes blazing , swinging her sword high to slice off niallkeareys head .	but
2	142800	She had been retreating into herself from the moment he had first discovered her scars .	Now he felt her hesitation , her tentative trust in him slowly returning .	but
0	110988	She looked up at him .	As though understanding all at once , she opened the waves of energy and let them flow .	and
1	121063	We were just talking about cabbing it .	We 've all been drinking .	because
0	71302	She stepped over to it , soaking her gear .	Plunged her dagger into its body , black blood spraying up from the wounds .	and
2	116422	As she entered the room , then came to an abrupt halt when she realized the tv was still on .	The room was empty .	but
0	4926	I told them how it had been speaking to me for years , how it talked of beauty and love .	How it had nudged me once to burn and destroy the mavericks in paris .	and
2	49084	Mottled surfaces covered some of the items : that bumpy , barnacle-like crust that was on the metal chunk he had taken from the wreck .	Most were covered by something chris was already familiar with .	but
0	136426	Andand several animals were killed by the blood-wizard .	Garrett did not avenge them .	and
0	46183	What i take you .	Turn you into a toaster oven .	and
2	29652	Janos slynt had turned from red to purple , jon saw .	Ser alliser thorne had gone pale .	but
3	26636	I think i can make this ride a tad safer and more of what you john wayne types might call bad ass .	You can spare about fifteen minutes and pitch in .	if
2	31516	I 'm sorry to intrude , and i thought you could maybe use these .	I heard you had troubles .	but
0	15749	Her father and lysssandra would go off to adventure .	Kill this felix and .	and
0	51304	I smiled a shaky smile at her .	Looked up at lahn to see him eyeing his wife .	and
2	32900	He might be a forger .	He could never kill anyone .	but
0	85474	Inexplicably walking through the walls of his prison .	Shouting at him to close his eyes .	and
2	8475	The warm weight comforted her .	It was a small consolation , for his slow breathing and lack of purring worried her .	but
3	41654	Its a bit difficult to take advantage of my fathers legend .	He has been a naughty boy .	if
2	79998	I wanted to be .	I had my own life to return to .	but
0	88706	Any of these lusty soldiers get within five feet . '' .	They 'll regret it .	and
0	140645	To watch the little beast .	Reach a village in the middle of dhemlan .	and
3	100669	He could carry her every damn step of the way .	He wanted her at the bottom of the cellar stairs .	if
4	140607	`` , my heart overflowed .	Flynn asked me to reserve your table .	when
4	98743	A little relief eked through me , but i still delayed .	I realized it would be way too hard to slit my throat with me lying on my stomach .	when
2	2269	Dad had originally restored this one for himself .	Gave the car to me as a gift when he and my mother moved to texas a little over a year .	but
1	160176	My expression must have asked for me . '' .	He said , `` please , princess .	because
2	31292	My skin was a beacon of light in the darkness that surrounded us .	His only let off the darkness that at one time would have shone as radiantly as the sun .	but
4	94643	I had forgotten where i was .	I woke the next day .	when
3	64544	Besides the signal had already been sent .	Even he could disarm the thing .	if
0	58291	Almost you said something to me .	Then i said something back that you found funny .	and
0	141868	He just leaned back against the door of my garage-turned-studio .	Waited for my ranting to subside .	and
4	145667	She wanted to melt against him .	His hands tangled in her long , black hair .	when
4	145320	My father was outside .	I reached the cabin .	when
4	52190	After all , he 'd experienced her sharp tongue .	Once she was cornered and surprised .	when
0	115396	Natasha turned scolded him , look at you .	Saw her brothers wound .	and
4	107269	`` maybe in a few days we can go look at those apartments across from the pork pit , '' .	You 're feeling better .	when
3	8212	Then , he asked me , but he said it in a way that was completely unprofessional . '' .	I tried to stop .	if
4	18228	I remembered the smile i admired when he first walked into marshburn library .	I saw the smile on his face as he looked at the cake and read the card .	when
0	116738	George sat on a fallen log .	Looked at the three dead crows lying on the ground before him .	and
0	58752	That radiated through every part of his body .	When she spoke , her tone was light and teasing .	and
0	23517	I hit the concrete hard ran for the nearest street pole , my heart racing quicker than my feet .	Rolled to my feet .	and
3	142174	`` but at least we can fly over it , and perhaps even over canton . '' .	The mandarins do not object .	if
2	6478	Sprayberry never voiced it to anyone .	He considered the activity to present a very real danger .	but
0	151065	She was at his mercy .	He hated her with an unfathomable depth .	and
0	23585	Then turned spied marsh .	He jumped at the sound of the rap , and smiled .	and
2	149292	Aluminum is very difficult to acquire .	When a noble family recently left the city , i was able to buy some of their diningware .	but
0	34406	Vaulting into the bin .	Holding out his hand .	and
4	97883	Moreover she was often alone in the shadows .	Both her son and her husband were .	when
2	77182	He drove his power into her so hard and sharp that it tore her mouth from mine , and she was his animal to call ; the death of one might mean the death of both .	Spasmed her body underneath mine as if he meant to kill her if he could not keep her .	but
1	153792	Ryan must understand this .	I feel his hand leave the small of my back as he moves in front of me .	because
2	4313	It was clear lauren did not think the clothes were good enough for her .	She had the good sense to keep her opinion to herself .	but
4	15860	Her leg muscles seized up .	She sat for more than fifteen minutes and hurt like a son of a gun when she stretched them .	when
2	39467	I can not help .	Wish she were less observant .	but
4	117301	The city took over .	The former tenants vacated .	when
3	92935	There will be drama .	I let her linger for any length of time .	if
2	12875	Not in a panicked , get me off this ride kind of way .	In a this is awesome , i could stay on here for another loop kind of way .	but
3	137267	There 's a chair .	You 'd like to sit .	if
0	70378	He bobbed his own head .	Reached out to gently tussle her from one side to another .	and
0	55143	Angry , the women protested .	Told us to take it to our room .	and
3	142269	`` why do you need them ? '' .	You never plan to go back and rule .	if
2	74360	There were forests in the mountains east of tol honeth and around tol rane , of course .	Those forests were fir , pine and spruce - all softwoods .	but
0	138795	I 've heard awful stories about places before . '' .	They usually turned out to be about things that had happened generations before .	and
2	110183	Hoover was doing nothing .	Keeping the raptor in plain sight .	but
3	34159	He and olivia would have to go elsewhere just to get some damn peace .	Bram and his staff were going to be down his bloody throat this much .	if
2	126999	Meant to say this in my head .	I whispered it just loud enough for alex to hear .	but
4	35194	Mommy got grumpy . '' .	She was sick but daddy said it was the pain that made her that way , not the real mommy inside .	when
0	32535	My instincts had fully overtaken me .	All i could think was about piercing his skin .	and
2	44766	He was always the bachelor , the charming guy . '' .	Not the one anyone could really count on for the long haul .	but
3	37080	She might have some additional discomfort .	A woman has had little or no previous sexual experience .	if
2	156619	Her voice was shaky .	Her legs had become just a little bit more sturdy under her .	but
2	32857	Goliath insisted that everyone use his wrestling name when communicating to him .	He would use his real name at the hospital .	but
3	138003	So he could tell .	Anyone tried to get in .	if
2	40466	That was pretty lame .	I didnt think a book was what dr. shadows was referring to .	but
0	39455	You could walk down the street .	Meet yourself coming the other way .	and
2	144004	I got a job back in phoenix at our neighborhood public library .	Three months cam got in touch with us our small library was closed due to lack of funding and i was out of a job .	but
4	157951	She relaxes against me , resting her cheek against my shoulder .	We 're both satiated .	when
3	70200	He could resume his education .	He returned to civilian life .	if
1	144652	The shares would rocket up in price and trade around the $ 12.00 bid price .	Once the announcement was out about the proposed take-over bid .	because
0	10868	Marcus looked at me .	Chase 's need to rip his throat out became palpable in our joint mind .	and
2	133077	A pretty blonde nurse is telling him his burns need to be treated .	He shakes his head .	but
0	36878	Miriam had her way dreamer would leave with her .	Stay with her at her bungalow .	and
3	149476	Feinsilber felt so secure that he urged her to persuade all those from dolhinov living .	One could call it life , in kurenitz to come to the camp for safety .	if
2	107646	These are no ferals after all , plainly under harness ; and : we ought make amends if we can .	If we have trespassed upon the cultivated grounds of these men , we are in the wrong .	but
0	158513	To plugger the shoemaker in new cobblers [ 28 .	A hundred shirts had just walked out of the shop , which was more than plugger 's merchandise usually did .	and
2	29333	His team knew it .	Felt hindered at times when trying to plead to others for the same type of understanding .	but
3	138926	And , anderson lake would certainly be on his list of places to look .	He does start a search .	if
2	148885	The sound of the fire across the water was deafening and we edged our way slowly in spite of it .	The smell of smoke behind us was almost suffocating .	but
4	64589	I was in my car and driving nineteen hours straight to chicago without stopping , my own chest ready to explode from fear the entire way .	Rob phoned to tell me that mama had had a heart attack in the middle of his kitchen .	when
1	5447	I can not read the secrets of the universe .	You are an athene , and i am an ares , and though i can read the secrets of this heart she reached out and walked her fingers lightly over my heart .	because
3	80713	There were no serious repercussions .	Even i did get caught .	if
4	40046	My heart dropped a little bit , but there wasnt anything i could do about that or the food that wouldnt make it .	I saw how many guns would get left behind .	when
0	48538	Teddy took advantage of the room she gave him to maneuver , her body arching and straining .	Slid a finger inside her even as he continued to caress her with his thumb and katricia broke their kiss on a cry .	and
0	8910	Willy boy lay with his head on his saddle , his feet to the fire .	Wondered where the murderous bounty hunter was .	and
0	106473	He kicks at the tire of the car .	Slams his fist into the window .	and
0	27058	He turned without a word .	Left the red-haired boy yelling after him .	and
4	36060	I was watching him .	I said my boyfriend 's name .	when
2	13386	I resumed writing in my chart to kill the guilt .	It was too much that i stopped .	but
0	15225	Her all confused desperate and .	To be blunt , damn horny .	and
0	69422	He sent sportscenter into oblivion .	Trudged towards his door .	and
0	2576	Cried the stranger to her servant , without checking the speed of her horse .	The woman , after throwing two or three silver pieces at the foot of mine host , galloped after her mistress .	and
3	129296	You should assign someone else to deal with him as i suggested in the beginning . '' .	You think i 'm compromised .	if
2	33549	They had to produce id .	It was fairly painless , and one of the security guys detailed himself to escort them up .	but
3	39721	It was time to get to work .	Especially i was going to start studio classes .	if
2	157035	He attacked many phits with his powerful jaws .	It did little to prevent them from continuing their offensive .	but
2	76173	The future was clay , to be molded day by day .	The past was bedrock , immutable .	but
4	148254	He 'd called them .	He 'd learned bethanne was in branson .	when
4	64392	Who liked to keep an extremely low profile .	They were out in public .	when
4	53497	What they 'll look .	I let them out all over the floor .	when
4	816	He gave me a jolly high-five .	I saw blake on his way out .	when
0	48613	She took amira firmly by the arm covered her halfway with the sheet .	Guided her into the bed like a child .	and
0	124643	William wrapped his jacket around his sleeve .	Pushed aside some of the roof .	and
0	15934	I closed my eyes .	Gradually relaxed my clenching fingers .	and
2	14072	Yeah , my instinctive antipathy was spot on .	Then , it usually is .	but
4	93577	Now i 'm not scared at all .	I should be running for cover .	when
2	27263	They thought it would stand for eternity .	Now it 's no longer a dome at all .	but
2	23971	He is the lord of the crossing .	I am the lord of riverrun .	but
0	90481	Then she gasped , again and .	Her song became a shuddering wail , thin and high and full of agony .	and
2	133669	He shook his head in amusement ... and toward lindsey 's room .	Then turned around and headed right toward the stairs .	but
0	27765	Michael and bryson exchanged a quick look of alarm .	Then they were both beside her , helpless but .	and
4	73123	She shivered from head to toe .	He lay keeley on the bed .	when
0	84152	Cruz put his hand in his pocket .	Retrieved a peppermint wrapped in cellophane .	and
0	49468	Aimed the flashlight at the ground and across the rocky headland where the outhouse stood .	Quickly picked my way over the path .	and
0	112924	Crawled over the floor .	Crackled on each angle .	and
0	36638	That side of his skull collapsed .	Blood squirted out of him like juice from an orange .	and
3	133809	We could easily recreate the average halloween haul .	We had a quarter or two .	if
1	14368	How you really feel and come on to me .	That 's the only time you 're attracted me .	because
3	115883	Why havent you made a shelter for yourself in the woods .	You desire to do .	if
3	142510	Somewhere in that time , he could not remember .	It was one moment or a slow understanding .	if
2	115709	Once the couple were gone , eibhear headed back to the closet .	Gwenvael 's next words caused him to hit himself with the closet door .	but
2	160573	She hadnt anticipated any more killing .	She knew that arguing with barry was fruitless .	but
2	61284	Omcom ratted her out .	That is neither here nor .	but
0	93918	There are fewer than six hundred in the vaults . '' .	Assigned in the field .	and
4	61705	But , rod grew impatient .	His teacher had only arrived at the era when joseph had been sold into slavery to egypt .	when
2	88534	If luis put it another way , especially if it involved food , jase would agree and .	Luis would get to do a little shopping without actually saying that was what he wanted to do all .	but
3	116972	It would all be over and he could live a normal life .	He could get vince to confess .	if
2	32659	Olivia was mortified , so she smiled blandly and felt the heat radiate from her cheeks .	She knew better than to say anything .	but
0	53755	That 's horrific heartbreakingly unfair .	I 'd like to smash logan and gage together until they become one person , but .	and
2	157106	Clay tried to twist .	Stone pulled a move on him that put him down on his backside looking up .	but
4	34694	Growing old is such a delight . '' .	You can spend it witnessing the bravery of your grandchildren .	when
2	97457	Ice pops are in high demand by mums with young kids and .	These have not long been dropped by ken into the freezers .	but
2	47788	A few flakes drifted down and she could see the road and the horses up ahead , and that 's all she really needed .	Were cleared by the wipers .	but
2	58775	It was unusual for seth to be in his office on a sunday morning .	Things were coming down to the wire on the merger front and there were many important details to be worked out .	but
4	36537	He still burned at the memory of the moment he 'd gotten what he deserved for such idiocy then told him to go find someone in a lesser ... situation-who 'd deem him good enough to ... be with .	She 'd stared at him as if he 'd lost his mind .	when
0	2873	He was now adored by the crew .	Seen as the logical replacement for bluebeards role .	and
1	90035	What happened next they could never have anticipated .	The man stepped aside for them and pointed his sword towards the mountains .	because
0	39355	Instead i took lucas 's hand .	Attempted to feel that , only that , just his fingers in mine .	and
0	86693	It was on the way .	Jazz made verbal note of all the things she wanted to do later , when things were .	and
2	83536	Which is a lie .	It 's called for at the moment .	but
0	153807	Only when he found it several seconds .	Brought it back to the desk .	and
4	3083	She 'd almost done in europe .	She 'd first met max .	when
4	20207	I was almost seventeen years old .	I joined the confederate army in 1861 .	when
2	62015	Im just being paranoid , especially with all the stuff people are saying .	I have a really bad feeling .	but
0	922	Ardor turned from han ; i am greatly ashamed you took this beast and taught it the high guard way .	Said , i am ashamed .	and
0	126127	Going onto his knees , as if someone were forcing him down .	Fell , awkwardly , to the floor .	and
4	113426	To dip my pizza .	I read his letter .	when
0	68192	I was watching the stars . '' .	Wondering how the starmistresses remember them all .	and
1	67632	It just made the offender mad .	He suddenly reached across and grabbed the young ladys wrist .	because
3	47880	Daisy wondered ; or if the class difference would be so easy to tell .	They thought she and william were sweethearts .	if
3	31118	It necessary to talk extra loud on the phone .	Especially it was long distance .	if
2	92837	She thought he would speak .	He swallowed his words and followed .	but
0	99138	We 'd been mated .	His furry majesty had walked out on me in a huff .	and
4	65884	The tiara will glow with radiance up into the ceiling for all to see .	You and the tiara are a perfect match .	when
0	113344	She grumbled something under her breath set about preparing breakfast for tabitha and herself .	Gave the reflection a disapproving glare .	and
0	54331	She reached up , and she made a small , pleased sound .	Squeezed his hand with hers , her fingers fever-warm .	and
0	140750	This was an unprecedented event , for the horns were used only for the opening and closing ceremonies .	The other horns replied questioning .	and
2	79646	It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done .	When had the gods ever been fair .	but
4	56434	Hart pulled his thoughts from his frustrating dreams .	Reeve 's words caught his attention .	when
4	553	The truth just wouldnt come out .	He opened his mouth he planned on telling amin the truth but out of condition .	when
0	4920	He wrenched the torch from him .	Waved it over his head .	and
0	132981	To know what you like to eat .	What you will eat .	and
4	24930	They felt it was their duty to fix it .	There was a problem .	when
2	126972	It was never made into a ceremony like this .	... isaac better come up with something .	but
0	75715	Who 'd told yuri , except mona , in whom he 'd confided , preferring to talk than to make love on their one and only stolen night .	Maybe nobody else in the world knew what aaron had meant to yuri .	and
4	72524	Her gut tightened for a split second before she picked it up .	She looked at the caller id and saw her mother 's number .	when
0	10342	It smelled like bleach .	The squeaking wheels were only making ashton more and more nauseous .	and
2	153577	His smell was gone .	She would forever feel his presence .	but
2	33748	Jacob nodded along in agreement as angela spoke .	Added nothing of his own , just turned to william with an expression that was almost pleading .	but
4	101657	He can choose , and it carries an extremely powerful message of warning .	Other animals can pick up the scent .	when
2	37386	He 's never admitted it , despite his disdain for luxury .	I think he 's curious about the premier watchmakers .	but
4	143321	She was looking skeptical , to say the least .	I looked back at .	when
2	85937	Once mike came out swinging they fought .	What else could be expected from someone related to you .	but
0	87655	Its fruit was small , and although it looked easy enough to climb it had a habit of breaking twigs and dislodging feet at inconvenient moments .	Went from stomach-twisting sourness to wasp-filled rottenness .	and
2	137160	Ethan hoped she would decline .	He could tell by the light in her eyes that she was eager .	but
2	26787	They should have called the police .	They never got that .	but
0	11384	Oseth retrieved his spell .	Felt a bit of fatigue .	and
4	52113	Who had seen her potential .	She was a young witch still learning a priestess 's duties as well as the black widows ' craft .	when
0	147830	Claire cried , stretching out on her side , her head in her hand and she settled in .	Then threw herself on the bed .	and
0	57121	The hunter stepped carefully into the prow .	Sat on the narrow plank behind the tripod , where he set about quickly and expertly mounting the assassin 's silver pistol onto it .	and
4	51624	To take my misty carcass back to christophers house .	I noticed something strange within christophers blood .	when
0	146957	Mrs arcanum considered foreign parts only marginally less unspeakable than private parts .	Therefore added the curious yellow curry powder with a very small spoon .	and
2	155731	I warned you both .	You have just carried on doing what you wanted to do , not thinking about the consequences .	but
4	93717	He collapsed next to her .	Another jolt of sound and quaking shook the world .	when
2	10615	You did help us save elizabeth , and .	I swore to her that you would be not be harmed .	but
0	73545	He carried a carved staff in his right hand .	Bore a long-bladed sword on his left hip .	and
4	95866	The realization dawn on mr. whittemores face .	He matches the gunshot wound on my shoulder with the wolf he shot .	when
1	105851	You kidnapped olwen as retribution .	Your wife ran away from you and ended up with me .	because
4	106767	He 'll need more than my nine-to-five skills .	I 'm through with him .	when
2	41046	The grass was so overgrown , it looked more like a vacant lot than a school commons .	A faded scoreboard and a small stack of wooden bleachers argued .	but
2	140183	What was that message and .	Who had sent it .	but
0	74316	I 'm going to handle everything .	Then we 're going home .	and
2	10450	Paul had only disappointed her .	Clayton had destroyed her .	but
2	4517	Which has sustained us .	We are nearly at the end of our rations .	but
4	114091	It seemed to be working .	He was bucking against her , telling himself he 'd been using her from the start .	when
4	121382	The line of taur urgas became extinct some twelve years ago , king urgit 's seneschal . '' .	His last son was strangled in a cellar in rak goska upon the command of oskatat .	when
0	82298	Her parents were flying from chicago , meeting danny 's family .	Then they would all hop a plane to the caribbean .	and
3	141022	Tucking her hair behind her right ear .	Even there was nothing to tuck .	if
2	7739	It quickly became unpleasant .	She could grit her teeth she could get through it .	but
4	36416	To bother her with such minor complaints .	They had greater worries .	when
2	58679	You 're a good man . '' .	You 're not for her .	but
2	124188	He calls a couple times a year .	Hollis never makes me talk to him .	but
0	73665	You missed a rule , '' luc said .	I nodded , already anticipating the joke .	and
0	127570	His gaze tracked the graceful arch of the column of ice back to the aqueduct .	He flashed his hand in a quick wave at them before turning back to the stairs behind him , beckoning .	and
2	27387	He might not be a dwarf .	There had to be some of the blood in his veins .	but
1	100347	Beppe laughed at the thought of a retired farmer having rented his land to another farmer .	He had had enough of working on the land , and yet , he still spent a lot of time there helping him .	because
1	17027	How to do it .	Adrian had told me himself that touching me was his weakness .	because
3	66106	He thought , she 'd drown us both .	We were in water .	if
3	12052	I 'll never get another .	Even i start to dislike this one , or if they fire me .	if
0	71994	I was , but .	At the same time i was mildly aggrieved .	and
4	79991	Several of the horses whinnied .	The monster entered the clearing .	when
2	96514	He turned away from her and paused to look at her before he left .	Went towards the door .	but
2	12215	I tried to help .	My legs were shaking .	but
2	60095	She 'd continued with her calls in case the chef whom sam was sending over was completely unsuitable .	It seemed he was her only hope at this point .	but
4	12614	She felt like he was truly listening to what she was saying .	He looked at her .	when
2	127380	For a minute , i regretted sending the text .	Then i figured it was ashley , and hopefully would stay between us .	but
4	56763	Brant breathed a sigh of relief .	The bathroom door closed behind emma .	when
2	140509	It might be weird . '' .	It 's who we are .	but
3	148544	The only way the other children would get to play with this lovely snow was .	She had ms thropes cooperation .	if
3	22451	She would have been safe .	She 'd just gotten on that helicopter .	if
0	23193	One of the lizard-forms had swarmed over a nearby wall .	Leapt down onto one of the water-drenched cages holding the miserable firecrafters , raking at them with its talons .	and
4	142400	Asking for a new form .	She 'd written down the real year she 'd been born instead of the one she kept on file with actor 's equity .	when
3	108819	Jerrick suspected gary could be mean .	Someone were stupid enough to piss him off .	if
2	66323	It was raining out and cold .	The air had the sweet humidity , rare in colorado , that reminded her of the south .	but
4	58452	Still , bailey had never been wrong .	It came to her hunches .	when
4	55615	*** i startlingly woke up .	I felt the cold air hit my back .	when
4	66084	She could identify his scent .	She was human too but it was stronger when they were in wolf form .	when
2	146445	He was still stiff from his beating .	Internally he was at peace .	but
4	28941	I lost count of the number .	I passed one hundred .	when
4	95922	She knew she couldnt report shermans death to the hotel manager or anyone .	She was finally able to think clearly about what she should do .	when
0	152991	He ran his fingers over his flute .	Said , `` it 's been a while .	and
4	148745	She peered into the hole .	She made it to the trapdoor .	when
2	30362	Couldnt get in to either of them yesterday .	They seem to have finished .	but
2	98459	There was a slight twinkle in her eyes as she glanced over at lexi .	It immediately vanished when sean spoke .	but
0	97728	Wiping off his blood-covered blade .	Placing it in its sheath .	and
0	137008	Lunestra jenson put on his goggles .	Flipped the switch that turned on the vision setting .	and
2	27358	With the other , he pounded shumenko 's side .	He lacked shumenko 's leverage , and his blows did no damage .	but
4	37380	Sometimes his cousin rakkel comes .	He cant find a woman who will bed with him , otherwise it is only the two of them who lived there .	when
2	45576	I know it 's crazy .	I promise it will just be a few days , just an appearance , and then you can leave and go home for the holidays with your family .	but
0	119978	His stomach was as flat perfect as his illusion once had been , but .	This was no illusion .	and
3	84963	Socotra has other names-better names , : the isle of enchantment , the isle of the phoenix , tranquility island , among others .	Names matter anything to you .	if
3	93228	Are he 's been recruited by lavalle .	That 's the case chances .	if
0	649	I turned around to watch bodo go .	He was limping and reaching down to rub his crotch .	and
4	112052	The silence was broken .	The stranger suddenly said , mister wilson , we must leave .	when
2	138039	Yes , he 'd relinquished control to her .	He was still very much in command of the situation .	but
3	12627	`` , you 'll hate yourself .	You act on what you see in your head .	if
4	116858	She headed straight for the shower while he took the fish and a bag of charcoal out to the dock where there was a large outdoor grill .	They got back to the motel .	when
0	96385	When i was done , i slid it back into the sheath with a zing of sound .	Placed it on the top of the bureau beside ethan 's sword , already scabbarded .	and
4	25644	The ians voice trailed off .	He realized what he meant .	when
0	95156	In the near distance , less than a kilometer away , an enormous bluish shaft of light rose out of the ground .	Soared into the shelf of clouds that still lingered even as the rainy season had begun to fade .	and
3	31414	Moaning like id moan .	I were just playing a game of it .	if
4	49663	He had looked something like father callahan did .	She had told her brother .	when
2	88198	Steve glanced around in the hope of seeing an object that he could use as a weapon .	Instead found a potential way out .	but
4	127238	Helel would just stare coldly at his old friend .	They did happen to run into each other .	when
2	147918	Maedhros heard them amid his torment and cried aloud his voice was lost in the echoes of the stone .	Then the elves smote upon the gates of angband , and the challenge of their trumpets shook the towers of thangorodrim ; and .	but
2	158433	It was bad enough what they did to each other .	To do it to their children .	but
1	23242	To wait until the last month of my pregnancy .	We didnt have a whole lot of room to carry stuff around with us for four more months .	because
4	81648	She pulled the telephone number logan had given her for his friend eddie myers , who used to own the bar and grill , out of her pocket .	The phone was ready to go .	when
4	115654	In that corvette you owned back , i take it .	You were a senior in high school .	when
4	77643	They had needed a card and a code to get out .	He had slumped in the hall listening to those two officers fumble at this door earlier .	when
1	148489	To remain with them `` in spirit '' .	Simply it was so very rare for any dying person 's spirit to remain .	because
2	12120	She was still alive .	Couldnt survive much more smoke .	but
0	18748	When it had died away he cleared his throat .	Went on : `` twenty-seven abominations have been committed under nugganatic law , sir .	and
0	65016	The death of ismets brother will be difficult .	With this new threat , we will need him .	and
2	14507	I 'd been feeling good about my plan .	The good feeling was going .	but
2	124740	He had told her that they could not trust them .	She had still been holding out hope that everything would work out , until .	but
2	160684	She 'd slammed the portal door in an instant .	Her room had still smelled like gastric acid .	but
0	122705	We have kept our secrets for .	Now is not the time to form an allegiance with anyone even if we will be fighting for the same goals .	and
2	138464	Sitting on opposites ends .	Inexplicably drawn to each other .	but
0	106024	Last of all turgon arose , and , and passed the gates in the mountains , and they were shut behind him .	Went with his household silently through the hills .	and
3	122823	Then you need to go with an image - go with a body .	Youre going to make a launch into new markets .	if
2	44242	To see you as often , of course .	I still felt the same about you .	but
3	80770	And , then maybe the hassle will be worth it .	Daisy can put a smile on lily 's face .	if
2	70218	Jordan wanted to protest , and remembered the pilot who with his plane on fire had turned again to attack .	He remembered the island .	but
4	68967	Stubborn woman would stay up with him .	Even she had an early shift at the bank the next morning .	when
2	21130	He wanted to get in touch with wo and ask her about it .	He had other concerns , and the matter kept slipping his mind .	but
2	78676	Rochefort and d'artagnyn coolly greeted each other with their lips .	The cardinal was there , observing them with her vigilant eye .	but
0	16393	She poured the water from the kettle .	Proceeded to whip the tea with a bamboo whisk until it appeared slightly frothy .	and
2	22626	She tried to struggle .	Every move was met with a tightening of his viselike grip .	but
0	19093	She squeezes my hands .	It 's almost i can read her thoughts .	and
0	78916	I feel the same way .	It was my idea .	and
2	76931	I could see there were a few elves lying dead that i didnt kill so he couldnt be that bad .	The fact that he could just disappear in the blink of an eye made me uncomfortable .	but
2	112495	Before digby could finish his sentence , a dazzling ball of energy skimmed the top of his head and .	Exploded somewhere behind them .	but
2	4130	He 'd contacted doc monroe .	She 'd already gone to the hospital in spearfish to consult on keely 's behalf .	but
4	53070	But the imagination can not prepare for this . '' .	One has no feeling .	when
0	159202	The alianna avoided the fate of the new solara , she danced her majestic ponderous dance , perfectly precise .	Timed swinging around the deadly rocks .	and
2	17675	Facing mrs. hamilton , laura agreed .	Agonized in her mind about the decision .	but
4	91135	She reached into her reticule and felt the gun .	She was directly behind him .	when
2	10343	She couldnt wait to see bear again and maybe ms. clarissa and jack .	She wasnt sure that she wanted to leave her new family .	but
2	57767	She opens her mouth to speak .	A blinding flash from beyond the windows interrupts her and sends her reeling backward with a cry .	but
3	3692	I know all about your world . '' .	Even i 'm not part of it .	if
2	38404	Didnt have to do it too often these days .	Pulling myself into perfect military posture gave me a sense of purpose , not to mention a few extra inches which demanded respect , something this little man did not show much of toward me .	but
4	78873	Your dear beloved father mated with my mother .	Your mother was with child with you .	when
2	100258	He took the sheet .	Rather than look at it , his eyes were on my lips as i spoke .	but
0	111487	He got to his knees .	Crawled before launching himself to his feet and bounding .	and
3	86091	Please take a second to click that button and let your friends know about it .	You enjoyed our book .	if
0	112498	Sydney led me from the classroom .	We walked out into the sunshine of the day .	and
0	116440	He put a hand on her handlebar .	Leaned forward , eyes staring as though he saw right through the mirror shield .	and
2	90542	- you have been amazing , and i hope i 'm not forcing you to be someone you 're .	I know it 's just been a few days .	but
0	78866	Fine , send a group ahead to claim it , rhaldan said .	Rose from the stone bench .	and
4	97016	To mine ask the server if she could get the manager .	I heard this gentleman at the table .	when
4	16247	Kieran 's promotion and transfer took him to bristol , a city close to gram .	Kieran and jenny moved to england .	when
0	120400	Sipping a cup of tea .	Smiling as he watched tiny trying desperately to get herself .	and
3	60701	Then maybe ... ... or .	She could curl them around the bedposts .	if
3	159462	Every vampire and shifter in this stronghold-besides riley , of course-would want the girl dead .	Mary ann was somehow a hybrid .	if
2	80321	Okay , '' she said , and this time it sounded like at least half a dozen voices .	Then more howls rose in the dis-tance - maybe south of them , maybe east , with the wind it was hard to tell .	but
2	66403	Hed long ago heard what the initials stood for .	Couldnt resist watching them shuffle awkwardly around the issue .	but
0	73589	Groaned in his sleep .	Stirred before settling down .	and
3	78610	Wondered , but then only a few hours later , exhausted and spent from the lovemaking .	Shed ever fall in love .	if
2	50475	There were no trees , of course , since we were way above the tree line .	There were scattered bushes and many wild flowers .	but
2	111840	He allowed himself to merge completely to calm the man .	The cat sensed what was about to happen and raged .	but
2	4400	The wolf howled in the most terrible way as it died .	Mixed in with its cry of pain was a laugh , a hyenas laugh .	but
0	100903	Having the story was a tremendous coup for logan 's .	I suspected a few congratulations were in order .	and
2	131835	He laid the flashlight flat on the desk so that its beam weakly and only partially illuminated the paper and started writing .	Rett , hearing a different noise , interrupted him in panic .	but
2	35561	He 'd been cold cocked .	The other man had been pummeled .	but
2	73073	I know you believe in devon .	You have to face the fact that he may not be able to find us .	but
4	122446	Often thought of this .	I felt scared or lonely .	when
3	5238	The ssd could use the fbi 's satellite technology to pinpoint his location .	He turned his phone on , if he used it to make one call .	if
2	23913	That would be lovely .	I think you will like this .	but
2	13183	They never took food for granted .	Making a dinner for someone you were romantically interested in took a simple meal to a whole new level .	but
4	10923	Hucks dashes behind woot then slides to the side .	The attacker is tossed from the engine compartment door as stray shots fire from the rooftop of the train .	when
3	62951	If she 's ever hurt , i will contact you .	Anything ever happens to her .	if
1	100212	Her the only titan zeus had permitted into his pantheon .	Partially he had fallen in love with her .	because
2	60067	It was proving to be a huge tourist attraction , bringing valuable grockles into the surrounding areas , unless i was covered from top to toe in oil and soot ( driving one of the shielders my favourites .	It could all be bought to a grinding halt if i appeared in the grand central station .	but
2	54986	Then jenna talbot showed up at the beginning of last year , and . '' .	She and holly became roommates .	but
2	116559	I knew he and jake looked like her .	The photo i 'd seen of her had been decades old .	but
2	129424	Oh , yes , it is , '' grey began , with some warmth .	It was unfortunate conversation in the stable at helwater that would have formed his prime example , he abandoned this tack .	but
3	121895	But , then we have come into an ambush . ' .	They are soldiers of thedua .	if
3	51293	Why would you care .	She or he sees your underwear in the trash can .	if
3	140195	She scratched a red spot on her belly .	Especially meant fewer bug bites .	if
3	103703	And then why are governments failing so miserably to meet the major challenges of our time .	The secular way is so superior .	if
3	70743	She 'd be dead by the end of the day .	The ouroboros on bethany 's back was real .	if
2	76472	Once the doors closed shut , nolen released gabriel for a moment .	Quickly put the pattern back up as gabriel reeled around with his fists clenched .	but
2	9075	Of course , he might have his own listening devices `` .	Put your hand down .	but
4	160121	He eased into me as though it was our first time .	I was whimpering and ready for penetration .	when
0	94483	Okay , '' i said .	Her soft , pleased sigh slipped over my skin like a silk scarf , raising gooseflesh .	and
4	126584	To refer to people .	They can not connect to each other .	when
0	60729	Dressdon pulled the door open .	Looked pointedly at zanas .	and
3	145931	See like switchin ' a body for your own , they 'll know , and ... and why in hell am i even discussing this with you .	You do what you 're thinkin ' .	if
2	92727	No one here was built like an olympic athlete .	No one was a complete and utter slug .	but
3	86675	They would have been shed .	I had tears to shed .	if
2	39693	New year 's celebrations were going on all over the city .	Here , on the outskirts of an old industrial park , it was dark .	but
2	2339	Who visited him , who knew him .	She was more than that .	but
4	118205	Did he kick you .	You were a little boy .	when
3	22440	`` , that 's your business .	You want to go to cel-romano with mr. scratch .	if
3	102487	Of course she could just imagine what they were thinking .	She thought it was odd .	if
4	35587	She pulled over into a parking space right in front of the famed abbey road studios .	She was safely around the corner from grimm 's estate .	when
0	143478	When i came into his presence , he was seated .	In his lap was a fat yellow cat .	and
2	104192	True to her word , kristine asked no more questions .	Accepted the peculiarities of their life .	but
4	55066	I never liked to smoke that much anyway , rawlie would explain in his gentle , distracted voice .	Someone asked him about the pipe .	when
1	7041	It took me fifteen minutes to get all the instruments out .	Mainly every time i offered one , someone else piped up that they wanted it .	because
0	110315	When last they came to the bend in the river .	Saw the road in the moonlight .	and
0	126585	She glanced quickly to the side to see that brick was fine .	Had just whipped out his crossbow , pointing it towards the fire .	and
3	56388	The rest was taken with vitamins and hormones that would not alter or harm you .	Even the injection was the same amount .	if
0	61443	To face my problems .	I must say it felt good .	and
1	126594	The only reason she had a chance to ask again was .	The man in the expensive suit and the eterna-shine shoes had developed into something of a problem for the jaunt attendants .	because
0	36975	The blast wave rolled over us .	Pushed her hard against me .	and
4	117594	To get the rest .	The job was done .	when
2	27054	For the edge of the forest is .	Calnibur is many miles across empty land .	but
0	138187	They 'd dressed her in flowing gowns of lavender gossamer .	Placed a crown of purple dried heather on her head .	and
0	137726	Hurt flashed across embers face .	Was replaced with anger .	and
4	62995	It felt good to see lily 's obvious relief , though he tried not to let it show .	Ryder made it back to the safe house .	when
0	81075	Being committed by the time max and stood waiting for our bags at baggage claim .	I cleared the overly suspicious french customs .	and
0	35830	Our hearts no longer beat , no longer sustained our lives .	Yet we needed them wholly intact to function .	and
3	15622	I 'll sell it to darnell .	I 've got any grade lower than a c .	if
4	109906	Chapter 5 casey was waiting for in a gas station near the airport .	Bev 's plane landed .	when
0	30325	Where anything from the yellow-eyed monsters to sophia and/or alex could walk in at any moment .	Take me by surprise .	and
3	110188	I would not be able to make my legs move .	I let myself think about where i was going .	if
4	160306	I felt the draw of the familiar , of the one thing , the one person that consumed me .	I 'd pulled the covers up to my chin and found myself staring blankly at the ceiling .	when
4	82720	The pimp had said to her .	He made her braid her hair and put plastic barrettes in it before she went out on the street .	when
2	132582	It had taken me a long time to put myself .	Slowly and surely , i had .	but
0	103797	They were not of this earth .	Perhaps their connection lies with another world we do not know of .	and
2	38608	Mark knew nothing about bergs .	Alec knew more than most .	but
0	124340	Blaine was rolling full out now , leading his last sonic boom across the waste lands to the place where mid-world ended .	Jake also found it easy to imagine the transteel piers at the end of the monorail .	and
1	103969	Apparently my dive-for-it tactic was warden-approved , ; he waited until kevin threw the fireball , and then threw himself flat in the snow .	Lewis did the same thing .	because
0	112967	I will rise now , and in the broad ways i will seek the one i love .	Go about the city in the streets .	and
2	119748	Ginger adored her boys .	She 'd never hesitated to call them on the carpet , even as adults .	but
4	13531	What 'll happen ? '' .	You find eden and you need to protect him .	when
3	30043	I wonder , she thought , crossing her arms on the table as she watched the dancing .	They even notice the outside world .	if
2	113041	He braced himself for the worst : the same casual cold shoulder from the cousins and measuring stare from kevin .	Tuesday was a repeat of monday .	but
2	90190	I pulled him inside , `` .	What does sneaking into a hospital room have to do with it .	but
0	60828	Rotting bodies were lying flat in the grass and in the streets .	Hanging over porch railings .	and
2	16814	I wondered if it was safer for us to just stay at level seven and wait for all the killing to be .	Sofia stepped up and brushed her fingers over one of the monitors , her eyes wide with surprise .	but
2	74511	Asked grey , for he thought he had just detected the slightest smile at the corners of the mans mouth .	This impression was short-lived , even those memories that were pleasant are rendered at best bitter-sweet by what happened next .	but
3	111691	Why the hades would caia care .	They locked me up .	if
0	71648	I listened to every word of the sermon , though i kept that down to a whisper because i have a terrible voice .	I sang along with the hymns .	and
2	145391	Patients and others were always coming and they did not usually linger to converse in the hall .	Going during wests office hours .	but
2	139746	I inhaled her vanilla scent and we both knew that would be a promise i could never keep , `` go eat , sweetheart . '' .	Wished i could promise her that i would never do anything to hurt her .	but
2	113752	The frame was folded in on itself , and also extremely durable and water proof .	Was made out of an extremely thin , flexible , and lightweight material .	but
0	63605	It would be the merlin 's call . '' .	He 'd love nothing better than to buy more time to work out how to get morgan out of this mess .	and
0	51727	I killed his brother .	Apparently he is a little upset about it .	and
2	100122	She had some general conversations with salander and salander was simply so drugged and exhausted that she would fall asleep while giannini was speaking .	Hinted at the outline of the strategy that she and blomkvist had planned .	but
2	30729	Funny , his eyes may not be the windows to his spirit .	Their ghostly shadows still amplified the soul within .	but
0	127027	It would suck the life out of me .	Spare the mess of a bullet .	and
0	41312	He got his shit .	Dedicated himself to service .	and
4	80934	The only light is the dimmed bulb above the bar .	We walk into the kitchen .	when
0	47363	Gnomes and other species treated the dead with veneration .	For the first time , i began to understand why .	and
3	66177	The funeral will probably be thursday .	We can get the body released in time .	if
0	68043	I pick up a loose branch .	Give a hard jab at the creature 's groin .	and
4	88094	He picked up a small painting he had set carefully on his bed , and hung it on the wall .	His chests were situated .	when
0	149607	You will cry to your mother at how good it is . '' .	I 'll spoil you from ever eating anyone else 's .	and
0	12558	That is all i see of you in my thoughts .	That is all you will ever be to me .	and
2	103298	The remaining iraqis ran under withering fire .	One stopped to peer under aarons tank .	but
3	31214	I 'll tell you .	You want to know what i 'm doing .	if
2	131501	The evening meal was made more festive by the stories told by jeremy .	Heather worried about betty .	but
2	74623	Catrina was still fighting against him , trying in vain to get closer to the doomed man .	Peter was still the stronger .	but
4	52750	Chapter 11 lana , part of me-a really big part-had hoped that it would force drake to realize that he was in love with me .	I had first gotten to new york .	when
4	156202	I guess the das going to give him the treatment .	He brings him in .	when
2	130393	Jon could not help wonder whether the red woman had lied of a purpose .	Mance rayder and his spearwives had not returned , and .	but
4	115083	Until monday , was in the shop .	He showed up at the restaurant in a rental car claiming his pickup .	when
3	56758	How many do you think will trust us to provide services .	The clinic gets the reputation for prosecuting clients .	if
2	1231	The alliance leader , a were-cougar and baths husband , was usually cool and in control of every situation .	He didnt sound calm .	but
4	85794	Of course he was also incredibly unapproachable .	He was all done up .	when
4	30368	Really talked to her since that day in the cafe .	I rushed out of .	when
3	64748	Where it should have stayed .	Even that meant it would go unanswered .	if
0	143109	The dead are getting smarter .	That is not just my point of view .	and
2	65477	At least there was an adjacent bathroom , and the men managed without leaving .	The women took turns going in to put on their costumes and straighten the black wigs .	but
1	91130	Not to think of wolf eyes .	It was too painful .	because
3	7425	Yamhill will be ordering the tribe to perform flavored or favored individual tasks with the populace next .	Maries doesnt emphasize the difference between the dihe and the establishment .	if
2	107664	I got the shield bracelet ready to go as i went down the stairs , just in case .	Nothing frustrated from fruitless attempts to break in was waiting for me .	but
0	94644	Him standing behind me .	Pulling me against him .	and
0	59237	Closing her hands into tight fists , she limped past him with her one broken heel lowered herself down to the ground .	Went to a tree .	and
2	136545	They are even sending down food or water .	We need to stay calm or we will get ourselves in trouble and maybe hurt .	but
2	22998	By - so old are they that their flesh has burned itself to the very tarmac , and .	When they rise , they pull half their faces off .	but
2	76087	I am tempted to pick up some of the pieces of shelter support .	Decide my time is better spent examining this , this , whatever it is .	but
2	44459	He had paid the farmers widow over the odds for a ramshackle truck .	She , feeling he had cheated her , had not told him henty was on the back of a coke truck .	but
3	147476	We had best get you cleaned up . '' .	You 're going to host a visitor .	if
4	129232	Susan 's happy life is torn .	Her teenage son goes missing the same night an explosion rips apart the community .	when
2	73833	Shawn wanted to introduce her to jacque .	Never had the chance because he was swamped by so many people .	but
4	24734	And own a castle like that woman who wrote harry potter .	The movie rights sell , then youll .	when
2	60590	I smiled and then it faded .	He returned the smile .	but
3	117210	Then he needed to be smart about it .	He wanted anything from this .	if
2	132471	The invite was always open to dante . '' .	He just likes to watch with marcus , trick , ryan , and dominic .	but
0	41383	I 'll take care of kincaid .	Protect him from salina .	and
2	158932	She tried to mask it , sense it .	He could see it .	but
4	152821	Dashing in for the kill , rift is surprised .	The injured mutt quickly finds its footing and scampers out of the room .	when
2	88034	He owns my mouth .	This time , it 's much softer and slower .	but
3	1266	And , jack thinks , he 'll probably kick henry 's blind ass for him .	Henry leyden has the temerity to congratulate him on this .	if
2	30880	Whose idea had been so great .	Whose execution of that idea had failed .	but
3	160663	I dont think i want to be alive anymore , i admitted .	I have to remain in this cell .	if
0	149594	They abandoned the lane leading away from the castle .	Struck off at a loping pace across a field of alfalfa .	and
2	90426	I 'd desperately wanted a shower .	Once i was in my room , the idea of getting undressed was exhausting to me , so i just slumped down on my bed , bisque , tweed , and all .	but
0	79172	Octavio took his wad of bills from behind his late son 's photograph .	Walked over to baca .	and
0	76545	The wind ripped it from his grasp .	Threw it against the wall with a bang .	and
4	62178	Kwemuzo had been speaking for about ten minutes .	There was a disturbance somewhere behind me .	when
2	74846	She knew they watched her they could not watch her all the time .	Knew that devon was camped .	but
2	36707	The locking mechanism bolted itself .	He checked anyway out of habit .	but
4	52364	She released a shrill scream .	She finally realized who-and what-she faced .	when
0	80658	It dropped its jaw in a doggy grin pounced .	Leapt away just as two of the staff .	and
3	149534	I would not do to kenzie what i 'd done to sam .	Even i had to make her hate me .	if
4	96220	I took them all down to sir horace 's room and left them roosting in the dark .	I had enough bats .	when
2	102171	I already knew the answer .	I wanted him to say it .	but
0	19508	`` on the three moons ' night , he 'll have his soldiers seize you .	You 're to be sacrificed with the other magi .	and
0	104175	The duchess 's voice echoed along the passage .	A look of terror crossed his face .	and
2	115484	And this is just hearsay , mind you .	The doctors have slowly been getting more and more power .	but
4	77594	They knew they had almost reached their destination .	Hugo reached an invisible barrier that prevented him from proceeding .	when
0	45222	Lady maccon rubbed her protesting belly with one hand .	Sipped tea with the other .	and
0	133238	She was welcome to utter her own opinion . '' .	She was certainly allowed to look us in the eyes .	and
3	121385	`` what , mliss ? '' .	We take him to a doctor .	if
2	38085	I sit across from galadriel .	I am not there at all .	but
1	79094	Not to think anything .	That would set him off .	because
0	52174	His mother would have a two-mile ride over washboards and ruts before she even got to tar .	It was nineteen miles to lewiston after that .	and
2	27550	He had a good reading knowledge of the language .	It was his first oral essay to a native speaker .	but
3	25167	It would diminish this wonderful feeling she had .	He showed even the slightest indifference .	if
1	118710	When mcwindstorm saw what was causing the smoke , maybe he felt compassion inside his evil chest .	He struck lightning toward the piles of bodies until nothing was left but skulls and bones .	because
2	44845	Every part of me trembled with anticipation .	Uncertainty gnawed at me .	but
2	139634	Tommy tried to spin .	The vise-strong grip beef had acquired from topping trees was overwhelming .	but
2	27552	There was no room in those true-blue eyes for pity , which was not a survival trait .	Sometimes it was possible to risk a little kindness .	but
0	4471	I slid pulled myself back up and onto the building .	Caught an iron rod .	and
3	89333	`` , ben , i apologize . '' .	I 've offended you .	if
0	132474	Then he used a pair of gloves .	Lowered the bean pot into the hole directly on top of six-inches of glowing coals .	and
1	109122	The grasshopper 's nous is male .	That 's what he wants him to be .	because
2	62489	He had suffered a severe concussion and he was resting comfortably and would be fine .	Had been unconscious for several hours .	but
2	32809	Well , i aint seen you there since you was eighteen years old .	I have to say that the b & b is doing much better than the brothel .	but
4	33608	I notice a giant image of a short man in a suit along with the members of your toxic sequel and the lead singer of wicked lambs , cilla craig .	We pass through the living room .	when
2	39296	He was up on this pedestal .	It was also a pedestal of suspicion .	but
2	65276	That seldom showed in braith .	On those infrequent occasions when braith let his guard down , he resembled jack the most .	but
4	132220	Or the people he hired , i mean , '' she amended .	No one immediately answered her .	when
3	66391	What will happen to you ? '' .	I go to jail .	if
2	35542	There i was standin in the parking lot , my hospital gown flappin in the wind , and .	Getting drenched in the rain and it was rainin somethin terrible like the skies done split open and were dumping down great big buckets of water on us or like all the angels in heaven was cryin or peein on our heads ( but there i go .	but
3	107217	You 'd have jumped at the chance to work there . '' .	What you 're saying is true .	if
3	81519	Why should we care .	We do the same to one of them .	if
4	9667	Dan spoke over his shoulder .	He went through a gate in the fence and headed for a house in the left front corner of the compound .	when
0	143464	He offered amara a hand up .	She squeezed his fingers once after she was on her feet .	and
3	49105	We 'll be no help .	We have a wreck and die .	if
2	116569	I was still stretching my lips up to smile at the surrounding faces .	It was a real strain .	but
4	145332	We didnt notice any trauma .	He arrived and we applied our first aid sympathy .	when
4	120812	Make sure i 'm not in the foyer .	You 're going to the elevator .	when
2	83243	Her plan was ruined .	She 'd figure out some other way to dispose of the body .	but
0	14918	Kadan came in turned around to regard them all .	Poured himself a cup of the rich , thick coffee nonny kept hot .	and
2	158401	He could 've quietly gathered the pieces .	Instead he is creating a huge public spectacle every time .	but
0	135399	Dropping the shorter spear .	Levelling the longer one .	and
3	97168	I would hunt down the one who killed her and , god forgive me , i am certain i would kill him .	My wife was murdered .	if
2	81418	All the klarn defer to chaytan .	Maintain a comradeship that the traders lack .	but
3	22407	They 're stories about companies we 're buying or selling , people who work for us .	You know how to read them .	if
4	47850	Her eyes clouded with confusion .	She looked at him .	when
2	138342	We didnt see it last night in the dark .	It appears the wolves got to your car .	but
2	151369	My aunt groaned soon we were singing with him .	My uncle started to sing , and .	but
0	15391	He pulled her hand to his cheek .	Snuggled into her warmth .	and
4	55633	So , the first thing he 'd tell em was that he was a recoverin alcoholic .	He went for a job one of the summer people needed done .	when
3	86959	I 'll be damned to helva .	I let her suffer any longer in silence .	if
4	33837	I only felt them . '' .	He covered my mouth .	when
2	141435	He looks like he plans to attack .	Then , surprising me , he takes a step back - on to the river of lava .	but
2	39871	My mobility was limited as soon at that son-of-a-bitch said daddy , every ounce of what little energy remained in me started to swell .	I knew i was weak , and .	but
0	25350	All that 's happened is someone has tampered with the t-3 's programming .	No one has stumbled across the implanted code .	and
2	140981	I 'd rather delve into the dessert section and .	Skip the meal this time .	but
2	109089	I know you 're worried .	You need to trust me on this .	but
0	123227	She held his gaze shrugged with feigned casualness .	His eyes had gone to cold steel , but .	and
3	65106	To go on as he was before she 'd returned , he could do that .	He wanted a clean break .	if
1	77036	Im still here is .	Now i want to kill you .	because
3	83398	But , im going to make you do push-ups all afternoon .	Any one of you tries to help me .	if
2	83231	I was looking at a map earlier and .	There is a town not too far from .	but
0	21244	Elma says , and receives an answer lump it .	Looks at ajbars eyes dropping tears .	and
0	155626	I took watch at 3:00 a.m. .	Derrick went into the tent to get some sleep .	and
4	52009	It caused the transmembrane sections to slide around and the proteins cease to be an effective channel through the cell membrane .	I did this asymmetrically to the four sections that made up the channel .	when
3	39831	So can the demons .	I can do that much .	if
2	70118	He had known ryus meeting with tawnya wouldnt go .	He hadnt expected to see him physically beaten .	but
0	40008	He jumped up then he was gone .	Stood for a moment by the bedside .	and
0	58690	The bruised leach looked towards his master for his approval .	He replied with a nod .	and
2	142039	There 's a couple of day bands . '' .	I 've screened them already and i 'm not interested .	but
0	23036	The tree was full of them .	There were more in the arched windows overhead , all around the yard .	and
2	116037	Your d.c. people had video of the ballroom . '' .	Clearly your new york people never saw it , because as well as being the woman in the party dress thursday night neagley was also one of the photographers outside the stock exchange .	but
2	71713	He had brownish-like hair very dark in appearance , and .	He was on top of that powerful with frightening coal black eyes .	but
2	151102	It becomes dark and smoky .	They all stay quiet .	but
2	78551	It took a never-ending moment .	Suddenly the tension in zel 's body switched to writhing passion .	but
0	44238	Elektra 's green eyes narrowed .	She regarded me for a long moment .	and
2	13402	I am not frightened .	You have every reason to be .	but
4	156646	I feel it quite impossible to do anything but love you . '' .	I think of this being the last time of seeing you for i do not know how long .	when
0	79550	`` oh dear , '' i whispered on my rasp , turning in the circle of frey 's arm toward sjofn 's uncle .	Lifted a hand to my head .	and
2	12100	I 'm not sure this qualifies .	At least it 's a nice ride , and we 're passengers for a change .	but
0	19404	A crash of thunder outside rattled the ceiling .	Made the lights flicker just as there was a knock on the door and mom poked her head in .	and
4	81049	Violet was level with him on her way out of the room .	Cadeon caught her with an arm around her waist .	when
2	13883	Isaac sensed her approach , and parried her blow at the last second .	Picked up his sword from the grass .	but
4	120569	It wasnt necessary and many climbers , of whom she was one , only liked to rappel .	It was impossible to down climb .	when
2	20924	They were new and pretty and by jacques of the rue des balais and .	Could not be resisted .	but
2	109406	None of their earlier hardships had jaded elvira .	Those years had shaped staffan .	but
3	27334	You would not have said it . '' .	I were truly beautiful .	if
0	15081	Suddenly the spinning , lights .	Sound stopped , only to be replaced by the feeling of falling .	and
0	134778	Please be assured that the maggot is not harmful .	The process will be over soon , said the executor .	and
2	49730	I still worked primarily in san francisco .	The regional work was fun and satisfying .	but
4	17594	No holy objects allowed .	Most of your congregation are vampires .	when
2	98123	They rode on in onerous silence .	When they reached the rise over the camp , he found a scene that defied description .	but
2	140510	She tries slipping to her old place in the back where she is shadowed by the overhanging cliff .	Nerin doesnt let that happen and motions serena to her side .	but
2	130742	We appear in public together when the situation necessitates it . '' .	For the most part , my wife and i are friends and nothing more .	but
2	75474	They were alone in the lobby .	She kept her voice low-pitched .	but
0	90858	`` nobody should be walking across our property , '' she yowled .	Tapped donna on the back .	and
2	155952	Barely paid attention to the two older men .	Instead focused on thanatos .	but
2	144985	Their father had never said that was the case .	Budda assumed his schoolmates knew what they were talking .	but
2	120384	Obviously something was bothering the boy .	He wasnt going to talk or maybe he just needed a nudge .	but
0	1422	We crossed it last night .	Slept in the open without seeing any .	and
0	96577	`` pierce brosnan was married here a few years .	That 's been a newer claim to fame .	and
2	45346	Who 's behind me .	I know that others are following .	but
1	104203	It 's good sex . '' .	There 's more than that between us .	because
1	57603	`` and this bothers you . '' .	... '' `` well ... it 's rude .	because
0	119433	`` ha ha , '' jeanne louise said dryly , twisting the hot water tap off as she went .	Pulled from his arms to step out of the shower .	and
3	101940	Then he doesnt deserve to be doing this .	He cant handle it .	if
0	102551	He quickly stands up , folding his arms .	Placing his hands under his armpits .	and
0	83586	Her smile was charming .	Showed no sign of being nervous that they discussed her potential for doing mischief .	and
3	98267	Was the thought that consumed his panicked mind .	Only i could lift that log and let the dragon land on it .	if
2	44034	Candace had always loved tiramisu .	Tonight she just picked at it .	but
1	45180	When people get their hair and nails done .	They have to run their mouths and tell every detail of their personal lives .	because
0	67941	Then go north toward doniphan and hike back west .	Leave the suv near the road .	and
0	151269	She threw her head .	Screamed as it buffeted her .	and
2	35529	It 's brown , like any normal package .	This one is different .	but
2	140375	The latest interception from a papal messenger had contained several letters .	As these were all addressed to james or charles stuart , they might well contain no reference to his holiness 's conversations with spain .	but
0	57136	They are all going to die , she whispered .	Could not keep fear out of her voice .	and
2	136475	There 's a stream not far from my campsite , either from chemicals or sewage or maybe a body or two upstream .	I 'm worried it might be contaminated .	but
2	128357	While i appreciate the thought that youd want us to be able to protect ourselves , tristofer began , holding the small shield as though it belonged to a small child .	I can not see how this will be that much of a help .	but
3	50681	Where the soul came from .	... '' `` that 's ! '' .	if
0	126751	He knew the kid was terrified .	He didnt want to reassure him with false hope .	and
0	69417	For the moment , clearly , he must step out of the struggle , come to himself .	Make a new start later in the evening .	and
1	65644	Then she gasped when he pushed into her with embarrassing ease .	She was still wet from what he 'd done to her the night before and , okay , maybe because she was more than a little turned on .	because
3	115544	Those were a real boon to the neighborhood-as .	She had use for either one .	if
2	64042	Fury had been bleeding .	He was still in human form .	but
4	147538	Most people are weird .	I mention junior college , like i am somehow lesser than because i went there .	when
2	137317	Tink was snoozing in his accustomed place , and .	The howling wind , the gently flickering lamplight , recalled the blizzard .	but
1	11559	Who had started the school 25 years earlier .	She hadnt been able to find an appropriate school for her son who had special learning needs .	because
2	68849	He appeared about to fling something from his hand .	He straightened and withdrew his hands into the fluttering folds of his cape .	but
2	34525	She couldnt even make out exactly what it was saying .	She knew it was a male voice .	but
0	45762	She lifted her feet off the floor .	Felt the heaviness in her calves grow .	and
2	31451	Horatius blasted back up into the clouds .	Above were satarels demons .	but
0	20050	He pulled away , but then he hauled me back and kissed me .	Reached for his crutches .	and
1	103616	Bothered to lock the car .	It was inside the locked gate .	because
2	114790	I would just leave it open , and its stuck in the wall above .	I want my bolt .	but
4	25144	`` i knew i liked you , mercer , '' he said .	We 'd finally stopped cackling , and i was glad i could blame my suddenly red cheeks on the laughter .	when
2	96488	I wish i could help you .	My work is here for .	but
3	148625	`` , in this situation , for the sake of another person , he would consider himself a failure . '' .	My father knew that i deliberately put myself .	if
4	67080	My heart is beating harder .	I look back at ryan .	when
4	31421	I rubbed my head , got up , and started to laugh .	I hit the ground .	when
0	133931	Shawn may be a one star arc but .	Once we take sabola from the summoners , being its rightful king , he will be expected to lead it .	and
0	6535	Ronan stumbled , all his edges blunted by alcohol .	The raven in his hands let out a feeble sound more percussive than vocal .	and
4	7720	I say , `` metaphysical i spy ! '' .	There 's a lull in the conversation and ben reaches for the radio knob .	when
2	29608	He had known when he jumped out of that burning building that his rescuing maly from the fire would escalate his standing within the group .	He had not anticipated that his rise to prominence would unfold so quickly or .	but
4	96512	Proceeded to throw plates at h. gale .	He attempted to enter the home .	when
0	56750	To side with him .	Face execution by the enforcers .	and
2	102280	Sex had been off her radar since before the divorce , and .	She didnt even know if her body could or would respond given the opportunity .	but
2	85641	And winnie hushed him .	He kept whooping and winnie finally said : jason .	but
0	25925	He 'd been a man of little honor , early on , chosen the path of the undead .	It was no surprise to fen when he had .	and
2	34802	Oh , she knew she 'd avoided him only a couple of weeks .	It had been different .	but
2	107444	In the back of my mind it seemed as though i had read about it .	I couldnt remember what it was called .	but
0	95474	But still she noted the way his grip tightened on the steering wheel .	It made him ache for him .	and
2	112288	The officials beside zolnerowich all leered at him .	The governess herself was barely perturbed .	but
0	130417	I 'm not ready . '' .	I 'm not sure i ever will be .	and
0	89984	To wait it out .	If lisser lost the battle , then try and sneak from the city and escape to aader in the north .	and
2	76669	I try to pull .	He tightens his grip .	but
0	67086	Now give me my knife .	Get out of my dreams .	and
3	38803	He could probably find a way to pass the time down .	Grandpa would trust him with keys to the dungeon .	if
2	109096	I could have let him see it .	It would have spoiled his moment .	but
2	79388	There was shocked silence as the music abruptly cut off .	Almost immediately , an uproar of applause startled the shit out of me .	but
2	105720	Usually lily takes care of this .	She 's silent , probably enjoying my uneasiness .	but
1	152629	Im glad i didnt marry you .	You be doing this very same thing with someone .	because
4	154750	He and craven had very quickly realized that he would need a secret means of access to the town house .	He 'd first started his career as the ghost of st. giles .	when
4	18267	Would not see the priest .	He came to him .	when
2	80516	Not they were hurt .	They tried to cheat their teammates and they got caught .	but
0	16593	`` hey , '' she said .	Pushed again , taking care not to disturb the feathers .	and
2	106795	Galen 's hand grew warm in mine , not heat warm .	He had been out in the sunshine and his skin held that warmth .	but
4	70427	They glowed like that .	You escaped the basement and ... '' when i had almost killed him .	when
0	74074	In desperation , cyrgon reached back in time .	Produced a huge army of his cyrgai .	and
0	69198	Go with this dude . '' .	Get something to eat .	and
2	122829	I already have a call in to his daughter . '' .	I 've been unable to reach her .	but
3	83408	It would have been someone .	It had not been me .	if
2	126367	One of the bridge 's supports and two of the heavy butt planks had been washed .	The squad up ahead had been working .	but
2	110893	I was mad about the cat , yes .	Scott would have gone on his way if i had left well enough .	but
2	50789	Mohammed was not only a great prophet .	He was also an ingenious commander and a wise politician .	but
0	110922	He lost the veneer of affability .	What was left had no interest in dessert .	and
4	137901	When the girl is worth it , i 'm not scared to do the work .	It gets hard . '' .	when
0	150043	Her fingers wrapped around a stein of some light beer .	Even at this distance , i could make out a couple of nasty bruises on her forearm .	and
0	16302	Dad 's waiting he 's got an appointment in duluth .	I would go with you , but .	and
2	11508	My heart is with modern history , as you know , and the civil rights movement .	I 'm a bit of a european history buff .	but
1	110865	It will be my last of the day .	I 'm finding this more tiring than i expected , especially with the veteran jumpers .	because
0	87547	`` we 're cuter , babe , '' he told her .	Dipped her back to a rousing kiss .	and
0	111775	He 'll die soon . '' .	I 'll take him .	and
2	121308	Tonight we should have been .	The world is conspiring to keep us .	but
4	119998	Which is pretty funny .	You think about it .	when
2	69982	Lil had done plenty in her life that she considered rash .	She 'd never hidden .	but
1	113289	Or maybe . '' .	Bad guys are dumb .	because
0	22484	He noted my intensity .	Looked to one side , perhaps wondering what i was tracking .	and
2	87699	I saw the back door standing open .	Didnt give it much thought .	but
4	25268	To haul her back down to the ground .	The asari spread her hands wide .	when
0	98536	She lifted the weapon .	Handed it to him .	and
2	136729	It was really sad .	They should have respected his decision .	but
0	96094	To hang out with my friends and talk .	Eat - two of my favorite things .	and
0	142068	Senator valerius , a saturnine man of middle years and tremendously dignified appearance , began to applaud with long , elegant hands .	There was irregularly spread support of the gesture .	and
4	72741	Emma gasped at the rainbow of colors .	They turned the corner .	when
3	101559	I would 've let him , but he was bigger than i was .	The dog weighed fifty pounds less .	if
2	125324	I was not only in danger of becoming a widow .	Having my expectations of becoming a father shattered .	but
2	62986	My favorite natural site in europe is the sognefjorden on the west coast of norway .	The views of the alps or from the alps are also breathtaking .	but
0	134680	A tension set in on them , and only the gentle hum of herrdon lightened the mood , for they were drenched .	Ifferon on several occasions felt his shoes splodge .	and
2	55428	Any person at this table could have helped her , none of them had had five minutes to spare for jill castle .	Could have changed her life .	but
2	40953	I had no idea what was in the note .	I did not want to bring that look back , no matter how incredibly guilty i felt hanging on to it .	but
2	82134	She had run off one night , eloping as she called it ; who need worry about the minor details when an adventure was in the making .	There was no gentleman involved .	but
0	78817	To go around his desk .	Help his alpha rebutton a lopsided waistcoat .	and
4	71133	He seriously creeped me out .	He was looking at me-he just kept staring .	when
2	120831	The cat was out of his sight .	Running flat out for solange .	but
0	10039	You dream you 're someplace back in time .	The dream is so real , not like a regular dream at all .	and
0	50373	Rick going rogue , the government moving in , the loss of three agents .	Now adam having to make a deal with jameson .	and
0	91757	Suddenly , the flame burst stopped .	The dragon let out another screech of frustration .	and
2	5777	She looked luscious and ripe .	If we were going to the fights , we had to get moving .	but
3	44638	Melvin , i dont know .	I can make a promise like that .	if
2	120215	Bret was close to where i 'd been sleeping , i think he had been even closer to me .	Had rolled away in his sleep .	but
2	61345	I dont propose to exercise moral judgment on you .	There are others wholl do just that , professor hobson for one .	but
2	72759	By december third , eleven babies had been born , and .	They were all strange .	but
2	155350	He had to survive .	Things would have to change .	but
4	66166	You were going to attack me .	I told you all that this morning .	when
0	147313	Since i got up this morning i 've watched cinna beaten to a pulp seen peeta die .	Landed in another arena .	and
3	156939	I can finally move forward with my life and be brave .	Maybe i can reflect in an unaffected way .	if
4	152941	Neither he nor his guards ever call you by that name .	They are addressing you .	when
0	40064	The apparition was gone .	In its place hung a few tatters of wispy smoke .	and
3	59507	We 'll have to fight .	We want to stay our own masters .	if
4	159538	I realized it was too late to take them .	The word escaped my lips .	when
0	55556	Luckily , adam cleared his throat .	Stepped in before i could prove him correct .	and
4	41221	That had been shattered by a fist in spain .	He was a young missionary .	when
0	40267	It swept over the marshes .	Finding the cottage in its way , tried to batter its way through and out the other side .	and
0	93317	Mara cut his throat . '' .	Took his eye as a souvenir .	and
2	43079	Grayson has always done his best to irritate me . '' .	Marriage to you is beyond the pale .	but
2	5494	He could see no people moving in either direction .	It was hard to tell for sure because the air was now full of fine dark ash .	but
2	149028	He tried to be gentle .	The excitement got to him .	but
3	61664	I would still insist on this match .	Even mr. coulson didnt so generously offer to move us into a better house .	if
2	146962	I wanted to brush them .	There was no room between us to slide a hand .	but
0	109872	Lj you and rocky , get over to jack rubys place .	Put the bug on our mafia friends .	and
3	109356	Must be a good two , three , maybe four pounds .	He 's an ounce .	if
2	58611	Poppy and john david actually had a human child , chase , as well as the cat .	They 'd had the cat longer .	but
0	34648	It is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by the elven-king .	Imprisoned without cause as we journeyed back to our own land .	and
2	108994	We even began to touch upon the fact that humphries had not only discovered the formula for time travel .	He had also single-handedly built himself a time machine in his garage .	but
2	14861	I loved alice when we were alone together , eating ice cream or raw cookie dough or painting our toenails green or telling stupid jokes .	Sometimes i felt left out whenever alice was around a boy she liked .	but
0	65997	Where he 'd begun gathering paperwork .	Tucking it neatly into a file carrying case .	and
0	29613	He never ceased to be proud of his increasing height .	He took pride in the way he dressed to wring the money from the tourists .	and
3	93364	Our elementary students could revolt and reveal mid-dance .	I dont make alternative arrangements .	if
2	104866	His tone was firm gentle , and , what he demanded .	I wanted to do what he asked .	but
0	19554	He literally vaulted over the railing .	Landed in a crouch on the deck .	and
0	19803	Chapter nine i bid good-bye to gaudreaux outside the bar then turned .	Headed back towards the square .	and
2	131034	I did , and .	It rests inside of this man-a man i 've allowed my heart to fall for .	but
0	87659	It was too soft far away for shallan to make it out , but .	She knew that look in her father 's eyes .	and
4	144029	He called out to me , the breath gone from her body , and showed me everything that had taken place .	Skyler was lying in his arms .	when
2	124557	I didnt want to ruin the party .	I really need to leave .	but
0	69674	What do you say we take our lunch break .	Then we can come back after lunch and i will explain everything to you .	and
2	65156	And yes , there was a group of them .	I had never seen them .	but
3	154522	You might actually catch people unaware .	You changed up your schedule once in a while .	if
4	20153	She pulled it toward her and opened the door .	It had rotated as far as it would go .	when
2	4644	They dont mind trades .	If raiders get wind of their stash , foley would be in danger .	but
2	117806	She was still in surgery .	No-one was harbouring negative thoughts about the outcome .	but
2	40730	She got out one night and and i fear mr fusspot is the son of many fathers , poor thing . ' .	There was an awful lot of barking .	but
2	63620	May i ask , and how the devil did you manage to get in .	I apologize if this sounds somewhat silly given the situation .	but
3	15256	And irreconcilable differences exist , then the waiting period can be shortened to six months .	The couple has not cohabited for a period of two years .	if
3	84932	I 'll lose it in the battle . '' .	I take it with me out .	if
2	56606	The same man answered .	This time when he opened the door , she also caught sight of rod .	but
3	25362	Suddenly , hanna wondered .	This was an incredibly stupid idea .	if
1	9156	We better do it all we can in the next three weeks . '' .	It 'll be at least six weeks after baby d 's birth before we can have sex .	because
0	81028	Every age thought they were so enlightened .	Every age was stumbling around in much the same darkness of ignorance and fear .	and
1	105171	I never did understand it but maybe thats .	I didnt get married myself til i was already past 40 , regular old maid i was .	because
2	24675	She wished she were surprised to see him .	She thought maybe she 'd been expecting him .	but
0	146529	She 'd eaten the candy bars .	Hidden the wrappers like he knew she did then he walked down to join her .	and
2	2469	Chloe hadnt seen jake since .	Their mothers had still kept in constant contact .	but
0	24026	My body was fully rested .	All the excitement of the previous day seemed to have happened in the distant past .	and
3	16739	You speak the language .	Nothing else , you could help me prepare my first round losers speech .	if
2	128204	Wondering if that went .	Then i tell myself to chill the hell out because nothing has changed .	but
3	84820	`` however , it is not me to say .	He is somehow involved in the threats against you .	if
2	88080	She was so tentative the first few times .	Now she 's opening up for me right away and pushing closer and i want her closer than anyone has ever been .	but
4	158530	Earring feels pretty good ! '' .	It 's trailing over my - `` `` too much information .	when
2	151894	`` we 're paid up until thursday , '' he says , `` ; we can leave tomorrow , or stay longer if you want . '' .	It 's up to you .	but
3	138664	At least it could be got on , and with a little padding of straw at the toes , the boots were entirely serviceable .	The borrowed coat was too large .	if
3	79412	`` , he 'll burn everything .	We fight him down .	if
0	9074	Mari suddenly walked up to her .	Gave her a hug as well , nearly causing echo to burst into tears .	and
1	67711	It was a way out .	I could see moonlit clouds scudding by , making me feel like i was moving .	because
4	49090	I was hoping to find it empty .	I got back to my apartment .	when
2	97546	I was not sure how distance used to be measured .	The numerals on the roof of the walkway were gradually counting down .	but
0	148009	As he runs , he fires his beanbag riot gun .	Hits the tiger , which continues to drag its prize .	and
1	7419	She had come back from the abyss .	His place on the sleeping bag beside amandas bed hadnt been appropriate .	because
0	159108	Soon they found a stream .	Decided to set up camp .	and
0	21657	Oh the girls ' working school had burned down , and .	On the same day two slim masked figures had robbed a bank .	and
2	113265	I had my suspicions .	I guess you just confirmed them .	but
3	23793	He was going to go crazy .	He stayed here and pined .	if
2	116217	He pulled on a robe .	Let it hang open as he moved from the bed .	but
4	158595	He hit another button .	He wanted to turn the alarms back on .	when
4	112614	He may have been executed .	It became clear that he had failed .	when
0	39314	Blending in with norms .	Get to new york where there is a full strength guild .	and
0	7929	Unexpectedly , tarren let out a loud snort .	Rolled onto his side .	and
2	102686	Papa , i think between the two of us , mrs. purdy and i can contrive .	First i will have some tea , if you please .	but
1	47221	People who are happily single are that way .	They 're happily independent .	because
2	97040	She sharpened the dagger .	She never sharpened the sword .	but
2	135829	An uneventful night would allay those fears and .	They would head to the scene of the real crime around dawn .	but
3	144717	Well come back tomorrow .	You cant get the package .	if
2	74149	Slowly the bricklike pattern faded , leaving the pale nakedness he thought he 'd glimpsed this morning .	Had convinced himself was nothing more than a mind trick .	but
2	85246	The expedition might not have learned anything significant about the base .	Hopefully the collected samples would help lead them in the right direction .	but
2	72714	To lose the kilt .	At least there was a pair of tartan trousers .	but
0	97022	Cupping the stone in her hand , she spoke in conversational edomic without commanding intent .	A bluish , translucent man appeared beside her .	and
1	53716	The sisters are happy .	There 's always a better turnout .	because
3	75253	`` however , '' the professor enjoined , `` .	I recall correctly the effects of these agents are somewhat cumulative .	if
2	98470	I 've never asked ? '' .	How much do you know about them .	but
0	29516	It was then he realized how much time transpired .	He was no longer in his bed .	and
2	64623	Having an affair with not one .	Two married goddesses might very well be enough of a catalyst to make him believe he deserved eternal torture .	but
3	2033	You have no idea .	We are the same or .	if
2	75981	She 'd already spotted him and .	Was coming straight toward him .	but
2	10980	He didnt want to get so comfortable as to fall .	He needed to be comfortable enough to make it through the rest of the night .	but
3	118007	To take the high road .	Even sitting in a darkened spa sounded way less appealing than just hanging out in her place .	if
2	142465	I owned a mobile spa company in new orleans up until having to evacuate the city .	Overall , i have been in the cosmetology industry for over twenty-one years .	but
0	122604	Expecting it , grace nevertheless gasped , her heart pounding .	Her head exploding in pain .	and
0	92456	They were all sitting in the blue-draped sitting room in the queen 's apartments .	The arrival of caalador with sparhawk 's letter had interrupted a serious discussion about what they were going to do about the interior ministry .	and
0	139372	Every single night she would call henrietta .	Ask her if she had made brick agreed to go with marcia .	and
0	19174	He made a neat incision dipped artery forceps into the cut .	Pulled it open with his fingers .	and
0	81530	He 'd touched his finger to his hat .	Called her that , nodding and smiling , his gray eyes warm .	and
0	118207	Let 's have another cup then i 'll tell you to take care of it yourself , do whatever you think is .	We can get on with the day .	and
0	24914	I went back to rob 's arms as the people trusted his name enough to come .	Soon the square were filled with folk taking their share of flour and grain and cheese and dried meat .	and
3	65231	I had no idea .	They were actually after me .	if
2	38758	You 'll probably never see them . '' .	If you do , you 'll know who they are .	but
1	121496	I wont tie my shoes .	There are children without shoes .	because
2	42615	I start to dial the number .	My hand shakes too hard to manage the little holes .	but
0	6937	He came slithering down a slide of loose stones ( scree , they call it .	Found himself on the level .	and
0	9457	He has been in the grip of the red thirst for uncounted centuries . '' .	I can soothe that fever .	and
2	89864	Her parents would have been happy to take karen .	They were attending a christmas party with their bridge club .	but
2	13288	Wit started to proclaim an insult .	She swatted him in the face with a stack of papers , giving him barely a glance as she continued on toward dalinar .	but
2	71443	I thought he sounded evasive .	Then he met my eyes .	but
4	75941	I 'd fished it out of his jacket pocket .	I packed up his stuff .	when
0	99641	Marsh cussed , and julian whirled , still smiling , and came at him .	Took three impetuous strides .	and
1	119021	That was out of their way .	Their way was whatever way they went .	because
2	144421	It was lowering to have him speak on my behalf .	He was better at it .	but
0	62896	Tomika folded her arms .	Sunk down into her seat to sulk .	and
3	73330	`` , describe my honey bear to me , '' .	So you see them .	if
0	90692	His eyes snapped open .	He pulled me back in .	and
0	123394	The medic nodded , looked into a file , headed : nahum kaplansky .	Then approached the docs desk .	and
2	11283	The nazis did their share of looting .	The soviets far outmatched them .	but
3	117712	My wife wil never let me hear the end of it .	I do damage him .	if
3	143210	Looking up at don , she said , `` we 'll be over in a sec . '' .	You could all just take a seat over there at the patio table .	if
4	122794	Unfortunately hope had mistakenly assumed that jared had sent another woman in poor grady 's direction , and she 'd played the same part .	Emily had answered grady 's phone .	when
0	6105	He shifted his feet to the couch .	Stretched his body the full length , the rich leather crunching and crinkling as he made himself comfortable .	and
2	83055	He knew this wasnt up to her normal standards .	She was being a trooper .	but
0	64926	I lifted the phone to my ear , clenching my hand to control the shaking .	Silently prayed that he could be understanding .	and
3	26983	Several years ago , she approached them with an offer in exchange for help .	This day should ever arise .	if
4	135936	But today nothing looked exactly the way the left brain expected it to .	You turned the picture .	when
0	38818	Senn , turson and senneel followed .	Soon they were walking down the road towards the settlement of the strangers .	and
2	125194	We may never know , all of these are questions that we dont have to answer .	We should take the opportunity to learn from the teachings of religious teachers to become a better people and live in a better society .	but
0	124092	We have had 6 empty seats in our meeting hall .	I believe many of our people have suffered .	and
4	101330	I 'm not surprised to see he 's got a pockmarked face and picket fence teeth .	He appears in the doorway .	when
2	45984	It was a death punctuated with the unsure .	Assumed sight that the cast of more blood on her hands would come of her brilliance in creation and twisted dark in the measures of unsavory minds .	but
2	1918	Oh , i know that you are angry now , brynna .	You will come to thank me one day .	but
0	142260	`` i think you 're more than a little tired , '' she said .	He had to look away before she could glimpse the truth .	and
4	31712	She screamed and ran back toward elizabeth 's chair and hid .	He pulled his hand back to splash her .	when
3	14321	You go ahead and do it , but one thing i know for damn sure is that i 'm your best shot at this , and no matter what my motivation was for being there , i 'm here right now for the three of you .	You want to arrest me and put me in a cell .	if
0	134169	The old man leaned out the door .	Asked , hows that .	and
2	12189	I dont know if youve even noticed .	Eric and chris take turns standing guard at night .	but
0	113975	Taking her time , she unknotted the belt .	Parted the robe to show him her bare br**sts . .	and
2	156096	It would kind of be weird if i just sat around counting his letters to you .	I promise you , theyre all there , every one youve ever received since living with me .	but
4	153396	Dangled the hook in the water .	A car pulled up and a man stepped out .	when
4	141195	You 're prepared to face the world .	I leave this earth .	when
3	63649	He 'd start a porn channel .	He wanted higher ratings .	if
4	110348	Her father held a hand down to her and hauled her up .	Imaya neared the top of the cliff .	when
2	37140	I shake out my arms , trying to rid them of the numbness taking over .	Movement only pushes the sensation into my torso .	but
2	55410	Eggs , milk and cheese were no-brainers .	Suave could never remember the other stuff .	but
2	64122	One bit of happiness , of hope , could make the difference in preserving his sanity .	It was a request easier made than fulfilled .	but
2	81565	We were headed for the cliffs , and .	I knew them better than almost anyone .	but
2	135240	She might have borne two children .	She still had a haunting aura of innocence .	but
4	76253	I was pleasantly surprised .	Gifts were brought out .	when
3	11910	It would be hard to find a more boring person than gwen .	Even i looked at the senior citizens stamp collection association .	if
0	69280	The ogre had gone into the vortex , never came out no one was brave enough to go in after him .	They had come with the chocolate ogre -- but .	and
3	117629	The sun reflecting off this window .	Anyway i doubt he could see us .	if
2	109617	That should have been pleasant .	Instead entered my nose smelling as repulsive as burning flesh .	but
2	59312	I 'll talk to lottie about timing . '' .	I 'm sure she 'll be willing to move a few things around for a chance like this .	but
4	33829	There is something you all will need to practice : swimming from the dock all the way around the island to the river while holding your breath .	You are 10 years old .	when
4	11288	Intending to gift it to my brother and sister-in-law .	Their baby arrives in another month 's time .	when
4	88037	Flashing into a near panic .	His fingertips moved farther .	when
0	58531	He saw the expression in her eyes .	Walked over to put an arm around her shoulders .	and
2	25753	Eventually you 'll refuse , and , and you 'll drag them into court .	They 'll fight it .	but
4	110765	Jacobs spoke to pearl , mr. harper is planning to retire for the evening .	We reached another checkpoint .	when
2	142883	For this one was female .	She was just as hungry and just as unpredictable .	but
4	19511	They were on the road of terror , well on their way to a terrible fate .	Darkness overtook the land .	when
2	130075	We 'll have to make our reconciliation seem suitably gradual , so i 'll keep up the appearance of using my penthouse for the most part . '' .	I 'll be spending as much time as possible as your new neighbor .	but
4	79257	They weaved their way along the river shoreline to a single country dirt lane .	They were stopped by police or military .	when
0	115164	Once when my sister josie was sick she had this substance in her eyes but vincent .	I would clean her face and then we would get on with our games .	and
0	35760	His expression was blank .	Yet her heart fluttered as it always did when he was .	and
0	128162	Fear of infection hit her .	She ended the kiss .	and
4	8695	He saw that she had tears in her eyes .	Carter looked up at his mother .	when
0	83559	Morris panicked , veron cried out shot its head , and bellowing with rage .	Pulling the pistol out .	and
0	21897	The british sis was more experienced , a formidable foe to canaris abwehr and himmlers sd .	Better equipped than her french and american allies .	and
4	111930	It was a desolate , thieving place .	I knew it and it was alive .	when
2	9931	They have several hours while they change trains .	That will be in four days .	but
0	118556	Sensation assaulted me - pale , distant ... heartless .	Yet my mind was still predominantly fixed on the way derek had looked in my dream .	and
0	80623	The cast hit them .	Then they were the ones doing the pushing and yelling .	and
2	77122	Caryell stayed sitting , chewing his most recent bite .	Turned toward mr. olefften with a bright smile in his eyes .	but
2	96391	I saw her run out of view and thats all .	Watched the guy pull the trigger .	but
4	97165	I like it . '' .	You 're here with me .	when
3	53241	They 'd be far richer than me . '' .	They 'd apply half the effort to earning the money that they spent trying to steal it .	if
1	141664	Living became even tougher .	Writing was getting tough .	because
3	38530	It would take longer for them to get there than she had .	Even i sent help .	if
3	40271	Then i 'll look for falco on my own . '' .	You 're thinking of going after him .	if
2	10412	It was a big commitment .	It kept me busy , which i preferred .	but
0	46914	Brielle chats incessantly about her dead bff as we get ready for cheer .	We face my parents and i spill an apology about my behavior earlier-lying like spilling oil .	and
2	34583	I would keep writing .	I have to get to class .	but
2	78754	He grabbed me and .	Shoved me into the trashcan .	but
2	14661	Mygle spend the night with me .	In the morning i made him go .	but
0	141978	To insure the safety of his people .	On his deathbed gave it to us out of respect for our ability to manage it .	and
4	8468	He probably saw me .	I was near the body .	when
4	58063	Was still fighting for his share of the suns rays .	Pablo had first flown onto his branches .	when
0	51230	Rae dropped her head , staring at the floor as she passed her .	Ran toward the marble steps as fast as she could .	and
2	39253	Aaron 's death was terrible .	She could handle it .	but
0	55209	A dry cleaner was next door .	In the next building was the insult to our existence , the vampire registration office .	and
0	137405	But brandt found me .	He told me that i 'd never get .	and
4	158236	I opine you 'll feel different . '' .	Your business partners fill your head with gum-flapping nonsense .	when
0	88215	Or i can touch these talismans of power .	Absorb from them pockets of energy that i had stored in them during moments of overwhelming beauty and positivity .	and
2	115113	Blinking , della tried to focus .	Then something weird happened .	but
0	36166	Branislava closed her eyes .	Bit back a sob .	and
4	135259	Enter the lift himself .	He froze in mid step .	when
2	155155	Lexi tried her best to ignore vincent the only time her heart did that crazy flip-flop thing was when she saw him .	Tried to date other guys .	but
2	19176	She was rapidly losing the fight .	They had very little they could do for her .	but
0	13552	I shut down the stereo , set the alarm system .	Turned off all the lights .	and
0	14300	Dagmar carefully placed the quill on the desk , placing her arm on the back of it .	Slowly turned in the chair .	and
0	156588	As they entered the room , he went to the first chest .	Began inspecting it for traps .	and
2	100530	He supposed there were quite a few of them .	Still ... it was just lights .	but
0	156944	He pulled out a key from a desk drawer .	Put it on the desk .	and
3	61112	He 'd surely kick himself for being so brash , but he had exhausted every other way of finding out why he was plagued by magic .	He wound up on the executioner 's block because of it .	if
0	90133	Talking to several of the neighbours .	Investigating the streets adjacent to the retirement complex .	and
0	13859	A group of louisianan ladies surrounded him .	She quietly made her escape .	and
4	158135	Her heart beat a little faster .	She saw the name ser willem darry .	when
2	159366	Farid bypassed the weakling german bureaucracy and he was unprepared for their response , which was one big shrug .	Went straight to the americans with his concerns .	but
2	90012	I wanted to beat him off of myself .	I couldnt move my cut arm .	but
2	160209	It was only a sliver .	She so rarely saw it in the forest .	but
0	28392	The vines had been completely tangled .	Had obviously grown here over a long period of time .	and
4	124312	My mom was a showgirl at the tropicana .	My dad met her .	when
0	147106	She was very lean , and were they up close , she would probably only come up to draegon 's shoulder .	Had a girlish figure .	and
0	1250	To get their heads .	Decide not to end the world .	and
0	114678	Came flying the guard ran .	Massed in a desperate arrow-head lunge into the sudden gap in the cross-fire .	and
3	11451	His eyes had been so hard , so cruel , as though he would have relished an excuse to fight .	Even it was with his best friend .	if
3	132997	Most would admit-allie and noah would use it as an excuse to build a fire and lie beside each other , falling ever more deeply in love .	It rained while they were out together-a miserable experience .	if
3	143049	Therefore , glendes and raffian chose to take this opportunity .	You can call it that .	if
2	36451	Eleanor gasped in surprise .	She was so slick that hart slid right into her .	but
2	95824	So i thought i 'd try this old thing .	It 's no good .	but
2	22182	Rob anybody was still hanging in the threads .	All his hair had come unplaited and stood out from his head in a great red ball .	but
2	45022	`` very well , '' rebecca replied .	Samuel was already at the door .	but
0	64820	She took his arm .	Led him back toward the deck .	and
0	103145	I was in trouble i only saw one way out of it .	Hated to say it , but .	and
2	142042	The left side of my body was out of the gray .	The rest of it was still in .	but
3	41971	I could get my message through .	The rest of them witnessed the devastation .	if
2	105579	Val and thistle were being stubborn .	That was hardly surprising .	but
2	154152	We 've got scout parties out , we 've been pulling in six or eight people a day .	We 'll keep you off that detail for a while .	but
0	148046	What happened to her .	Constantly fretted over what she 'd do when age finally claimed the other woman .	and
1	90623	She made the vow .	She was determined that it would be .	because
2	94735	I so badly wanted to run my fingertips down his chest and then across the stubble on his face .	I managed to stop myself .	but
0	141787	She opened her black bag .	Set it on the floor .	and
4	147793	Id finally drifted off in peaceful sublime .	The first pounding of a fist sounded loudly through the empty room .	when
0	195	Abide the idea of changing his mind now , especially as he thought that his actions might be justifiable .	He didnt want to shame the memory of his boys by cordially welcoming their potential captors to their hometown .	and
2	60408	Know i give him a hard time , nor does he ask why i 'm in the city to begin with .	He works really hard , and never says a word to dad about me crashing in his spare bedroom on most weekends .	but
4	110032	Was this the moment .	We were supposed to stop her .	when
1	144934	He is doing it .	He likes her and appreciates her innocence , honesty and simplicity .	because
0	119989	He slowed down , dancing closer , rubbing his cheek along mine .	Pulled me out of the thick of the leaping throngs .	and
0	63860	Were in some problem .	He with this auspicious mark may be of some help .	and
0	98238	The smaller man dodge while steele chipped away at him .	Block like a maniac .	and
3	138414	Maybe she would have .	I had called her .	if
0	70800	Once that was done , loki slowly moved out of the way .	The first wave of reapers surged through the opening , their swords up and ready to attack .	and
2	111023	He may recognize you as part of my team .	I can trust him to keep it to himself .	but
2	150247	Contacting me now like that is a completely bastard thing to do .	The more i think about it , the more typically him it is .	but
0	129012	He read the guardian 's agitation .	Smiled in gentle sympathy and understanding .	and
4	66981	Ms. gunderson was talking with a client at her desk .	She entered the bank .	when
0	35458	He searched for anything else hidden away on his person .	Found success in a wide pocket on the inside of his cloak .	and
2	30671	Whiskers covered his weathered face .	He approached her respectfully and aundy appreciated the way he took off his hat and tipped his head her direction .	but
4	93446	I clutched at him .	He tried to pull out of me .	when
0	128512	Ouch , '' he said .	Pulled the knife free .	and
2	93799	Ignoring the flutter in my stomach , i walked casually toward him .	My confidence slipped a little when jake 's eyes found me .	but
2	106295	Anyway i wouldnt have thought any more about it .	Two days later , i could swear i saw him again loitering on a street corner while i was doing the shopping .	but
0	148508	She reflected for a long moment ? '' .	Then asked : `` what about you .	and
0	73471	He kissed her once more , her sweet , drenched , mourning face , and he pressed his lips to hers , meaning only to offer comfort , as much as he could .	She lifted her face to him .	and
0	45125	She headed back into his bedroom .	Locked the door behind her .	and
2	34297	You have my ear , aunt , and my audience . '' .	Considering your fated mates spell did saddle me with a wife who doth refuse to obey , i can not promise i will heed your advice .	but
4	101506	Patricks heart sounded like a train chasing me down the tracks .	His lips moved against mine , smoothing and gently sucking with the skil of a man whod had countless decades and even more countless women to perfect his craft on .	when
0	8893	The room to which tajak took them was large , swinging on chains from the ceiling .	Was illuminated by costly oil lamps .	and
3	123220	He did not know .	He , a commoner , would get in trouble , walking like this with the king 's daughter .	if
0	110781	Within seconds he was silent .	Nhar made a number of hideous sounds , but .	and
0	39932	Thou may return nextday to fetch my clutch .	Place them in stasis .	and
2	29842	You could call a nine-foot-tall man lesser .	In that moment we were all just simply fey and it was good .	but
0	10588	I begin to stand to go get cleaned up for the evening but ephraim grabs my arm .	Stops me how do you feel about training with me tomorrow for a change of pace .	and
0	31748	Or would he bring her back .	Expect the two girls to accept her as their mother .	and
0	136972	Maeve can not testify to them because she is exiled .	An exile may not give testimony against another member of faerie .	and
2	81968	Mr stingy sat on stadium carpet grass wishing doing same .	He was not allowed based on his personality .	but
4	927	You 've been highly trained .	That adrenaline 's flooding your system , it can be difficult to remember intricate moves . '' .	when
1	1545	Despite being seven years apart , kayla and her sister shared a close bond .	Perhaps they had no other siblings .	because
3	112265	Once again answering with my thoughts .	Even they were starker than i would 've put into words .	if
2	85298	The window beside us has a view of the school 's courtyard .	Everyone is gone for the day .	but
0	39258	Turning her back to the scene , she looked over at leon .	Forced a smile to her face .	and
0	108157	It was completely free of shadows .	I could see all the images of the battle that we 'd just been through .	and
2	111482	I told winter i was coming to see you .	I never expected to spend the night .	but
3	35517	Ill burn this entire street to the ground .	You dont come out and face me .	if
2	17586	General chu , moscow is in some sense the central city of their nation-it is not formally the capital .	The tsar is crowned .	but
2	132248	Mrs. walters is a good soul . '' .	I fear she has an inept cook .	but
3	19065	She could sense them .	She really focused on the leopard .	if
0	23321	I 'm only partially buzzed . '' .	Was hoping to be totally and completely smashed by the time the sun set .	and
2	94492	He glares at her .	Says nothing because , actually , he did .	but
3	6461	To eventually move my father .	Our relationship was strong .	if
3	134108	Treacherous bastard . '' .	He told me the sky was green before i would believe a word that came from your filthy mouth .	if
0	146309	To ease the land .	Subdue your people with an overwhelming invasion .	and
4	127290	She 'd look like a fool .	She wrongly declared that seth rafferty was a carpenter on national television .	when
4	145054	She waved at paka .	She spotted him and he waved back , thinking that she must be one of the friendliest mothers he knew , besides his mother .	when
4	154677	And now she needed her son 's level head to steady her .	She was bound to harrison and close to being seduced by him .	when
4	54360	He turned off the faucet .	The water reached fitzsimmonss neck .	when
0	57961	So when we came to her house .	Saw the cop cars .	and
2	140576	The place was a far cry from the opulence of royal guest housing .	It was cozy and clean and undoubtedly well loved by mia and her father .	but
1	72698	It 's funny that donna listens to songs about freaks .	She is so cool and hip and stylish and smart and together and she is definitely what every woman wants to be as far as i 'm concerned-certainly not a freak like me .	because
2	86247	I am not happy to have been part of it .	Mr.alvarez saw it fit to play me as much of a fool as he played all of you and everybody .	but
0	12675	Instead he wanted to give her the opportunity to talk him into staying .	She did that most insistently , and entirely without words .	and
4	50698	Been there for tristan .	He needed someone - me .	when
1	90317	To even meet up with someone at the bar .	I have to go through so many movements .	because
4	11857	Of course , he would skip over that moment ; much as he tried , he could not help but quake when mr. barnstock glared at him with those steely eyes .	He had felt his knees knocking together from fear .	when
0	145528	Her face was flushed shiny , and .	She dabbed it softly with a white towel .	and
3	46870	There will be a big outdoors party afterwards , with lots of beer for all ! '' .	You recruits do well at it .	if
3	139764	He 'd go into instant attack mode .	He saw the shifter .	if
2	145975	I hated to admit it .	This was because i was chicken .	but
0	26028	Miranda came out of her room .	Kylie dropped socks to the floor and started picking up the mess .	and
4	21696	Thats surprising , vince never holds .	He throws a punch .	when
4	104932	He heard an awkward catch in her voice .	She said the word father .	when
2	148379	He loved good sex , hard sex , and part of him always made sure not to let go .	He did have it with slender women .	but
2	102089	`` and then the king said he would release us .	First he would demonstrate to all the court that we had no power , and therefore the priests would be appeased .	but
2	151371	She had had her fill of smoky rooms and stale beer and .	While uni had been a great time , it would be nice to actually put the resulting piece of paper to some use .	but
3	124002	To concentrate on her footing .	She was to keep up with them .	if
0	63408	Likely lying down for twelve hours .	I winced as the light hit me .	and
2	92867	To top it off , not only was he drop dead gorgeous .	He currently smelled like the most delicious mixture of sweet smoke and spices .	but
1	154053	Her hair was messed .	She had been lying down , which made me feel oddly tender towards her .	because
2	144761	Part of me really wants to meet him .	I am still not sure i want to get involved in whatever sam has in mind .	but
0	155568	Xin scanned it , quickly moved to hovering position over it turned the spacecraft on .	Accessed the ships computer .	and
0	129559	A door freely swung open .	Shut near the bottom .	and
3	149871	Her keys i had pretty much figured out mallorys fate .	Even i didnt want to admit it to myself .	if
3	131234	I 've put my hood up . '' .	You know what i mean , just to get a guy to talk to me .	if
2	141117	`` now , i know you 're enjoying yourself with her .	Tomorrow night i will need my husband by my side .	but
0	126246	Cameron 's arms enfold around me he pulls me back .	When he then goes to leave with raven , i start to chase after him , but .	and
2	63917	The competition between us drove us .	It also made you stronger .	but
1	25293	The challenged measure is an invalid exercise of the police power .	The method employed to conserve the carabaos is not reasonably necessary to the purpose of the law and , worse , is unduly oppressive .	because
3	52560	Here stood judas iscariot , the most infamous man in history , the betrayer who sent christ to the cross .	This man spoke the truth and was not some deluded soul .	if
2	3358	Then greer shouldered into matt , trying to get him to hurry .	Succeeded in almost knocking him down .	but
2	150962	When he was very angry .	Controlling it with an effort of will .	but
0	50177	He has seen the dragon fire pattern .	Is enthralled by how the torch light in the chamber playfully flickers off the blade and animates its surface .	and
0	7878	His jaw was clenched .	His eyes looked blankly ahead as if he were waiting for me to scream .	and
0	41256	The guards began to beat the hag .	Nicolette appeared to take offense to that .	and
0	56867	With that , he turned , his footsteps leaving no trace in the dirt .	Walked toward the sealed crack in the earth .	and
2	78242	It was way too early for me to be up on a sunday morning .	Since the thought of what would be waiting for me if i did manage to fall back to sleep scared the snot out of me , i popped out of bed .	but
2	10000	Gilla opened her mouth , most likely to give a wise guy remark .	She thought better of it and disappeared through the trees .	but
2	39067	The muchdecorated captain not only was in line forpromotion .	Was considered a potential candidatefor the joint chiefs of staff .	but
0	146487	His clothes were well worn , likely slept in for the last few days .	Probably purchased in the eighties .	and
2	84764	He was a solid man , heavy muscle .	She had the feeling he 'd be fast-maybe even as fast as she was .	but
2	146525	One of them pulled a grenade .	It was too late .	but
4	136387	Texas paid $ 18 million dollars , michigan .	We look at coaches pay .	when
2	54562	If you dont tell him , ill percy edged closer .	Nearly stumbled and caught himself as he grabbed a nearby small table .	but
0	40218	If weapons were gathered from off-base soldiers or police in a piecemeal way , the armed forces of the philippines ( afp ) or the police might change their system of operational readiness .	Secure all weapons on the base or station .	and
0	50578	Trevor came all the way to the locker room to tell duke that he did a good job .	Duke and his buddies laughed at him .	and
1	128565	I had you come over to me .	It proved that i can do what i claim i can do .	because
3	19195	Aim it at sharav .	Samuel could use all that power .	if
2	151493	Cat looks alarmed at my words .	Downright scared when i grab her shoulders .	but
0	28257	I stopped about three feet away from the guard , dropped my head , batted my lashes gave him my most flirtatious look .	Struck a model pose .	and
0	59620	I want to marry you , and have sweet weed children with you , and .	Make sweet weed love to you .	and
4	149247	It was easier to manage the pain .	He was focussed on julia .	when
0	132487	You get any other ideas .	You 're the next to die , old pal .	and
3	13849	I 'll feed you .	It 's a matter of you needing energy .	if
4	42200	I finally lifted my eyes to meet his aquamarine gaze .	I was facing him .	when
0	14853	With the decision , relief filled him .	Inside , where instinct swirled , a sudden knowing bloomed .	and
0	118582	But other than that i could still see was about to puke too bad so i was guessing i wasnt about to die .	I didnt feel like i .	and
0	62482	They were shooting for the night of the new moon after the next new moon , roughly 7 weeks .	The plan was to get luke into the walled city before that time , to give him enough time to find a rope without being observed .	and
2	117363	Nate and i looked at each other for a second .	Quickly averted our eyes .	but
0	99815	It was reserved for special guests .	It would normally be an older boy attending to their needs .	and
4	38377	Then i shot at you .	You came in the door .	when
3	77576	As i was certain it was , someone had gone to an awful lot of trouble to keep people .	The inside was hollow .	if
4	97610	Chloe had actually been grateful .	Three weeks passed and they had only been able to find myrna adams , a local black spinster , to take her in .	when
0	51798	He closed his eyes .	Cringed waiting for the impending crash .	and
0	113198	In back alleys and darkened rooms people would gather in the village .	Discuss a story that would not seem to go .	and
0	152846	Still , he looked up at noir , showing off a mouth full of bloody teeth .	Laughed through his pain .	and
0	145759	`` shall i turn pirate king , and fill a covert with gold from spanish merchant ships for you ? '' .	Go raiding in the west indies .	and
0	61959	Cannibalistic vampires target the weaker of their species .	They react to undead blood .	and
3	126841	`` hey , i wonder .	Anyone in that graveyard ever thought about cloning .	if
2	76825	Rasmere was running out of wind .	So was the ganthor .	but
3	95219	After all , how come he didnt know about his death .	He and dad were such good friends .	if
4	33630	Why so much food was ordered for these events .	These women barely ate any of it .	when
4	154236	How company stock values rise .	The employees have stock options .	when
2	122625	You may get the tourists . '' .	Pastry buyers prefer a window shop on the right .	but
0	146308	Wolf 's gun was cocked .	Aimed at his face in a flash .	and
2	8971	It was a farm accident .	Belinda was sure that her father had killed him .	but
2	121150	The anaconda goes after the elder .	As it 's about to open its mouth to swallow him , the inevitable happens .	but
2	128538	He thought he sounded casual as hell .	Jim barked out a laugh .	but
0	63126	To get in touch with mr. vella .	Invite him to have lunch with me tomorrow aboard ship .	and
0	28960	With that she lifted him off the table .	Shoved him from the chamber .	and
0	154128	His answering smile was warm .	Inviting with just enough sexy to make her hungry for more .	and
4	26995	Why she needed the vehicle .	In fact she needed something big enough to carry several alterants if she managed to get some out of the abc .	when
3	113540	I could not reverse the changes . '' .	Even i wanted to .	if
3	82173	To discover for themselves .	The rumor of his cold ruthlessness was fact or fiction .	if
2	135647	When i come back , who 's sitting in the room right on the edge of the same bed where we 'd just been sleeping this guy .	We curled up together and crashed , and the next morning , i went on a starbucks run , and .	but
0	91937	Then it hit me .	I sighed in relief .	and
3	11780	I was wondering . '' .	You had anything to say about that .	if
3	128545	Asphodel thought you wouldnt mind .	We searched for something clean in his pack .	if
0	2204	The wind off the river was icy the warmth was fading .	His hands , his lips , still felt warm from clary 's touch , but .	and
3	39811	It made her wonder .	They could make things work between them .	if
0	36148	The great guide himself is waiting outside .	You will have the honour of entertaining him when he enters .	and
0	46214	He made sure the ladies were out of earshot .	Took his father by the arm to pull him farther from the door leading to the dining room .	and
1	14880	That 's apparently all the conversation jamie can stand .	She closes her eyes , tilts back her head , and starts to soak up the sun .	because
0	149256	I would find out what lay beyond the sphere , i would discover what dangers threatened my people , but the future of all valirons .	I would be forced to make choices that would not only change my future .	and
3	102950	His eyes bored into mine .	Pleading for me to take it .	if
0	106628	That dried at low tide .	Dropped away into unfathomable blue .	and
3	22286	There could be no bravery , but galad would rather have the light shine on him while he continued to draw breath .	There was no danger of death .	if
1	159141	How much i drank .	I am whos driving , in the end .	because
3	66744	It would look odd .	I sought out a particular conversation without my handler 's guidance .	if
0	154447	Yes he was pretty sure the assassins were coming from one direction .	They should head in the other .	and
0	59979	The last tour , we went to sun .	We swam in sunfire pools with the whales .	and
2	14953	Of course , there will have been many affected by the change .	There will be one or two in particular whose destinies were the focus of the change .	but
0	73534	Nothing at first , merely looked .	Under his gaze the brother squirmed .	and
4	53912	She still held the strange key in her hand .	She entered the cabin .	when
2	95911	At first i thought that he was going to talk about charity 's attack .	He was thinking more .	but
2	91495	Only two thin sheets of transparent material kept her prisoner here with him .	It would take a car ramming into the glass at respectable speed to break it .	but
0	107846	Rodriguez opened up a folder stuck in the side pocket of his driver 's side door , obviously off of surveillance cameras .	Slid out a collection of photos-grainy .	and
3	70357	`` they 'll kill her . '' .	The police become involved .	if
0	27646	They remained steady sure , though as time passed he found himself increasingly grateful for the smooth wood of the handrail beneath his grasp .	His strides were not as swift as they had once been , but .	and
2	18292	`` belle - '' he started to disagree , using words that tore through his system , searing a direct path straight to his soul .	She finished what she intended to say .	but
4	11789	Already on the edge of orgasm .	He entered her , alex lasted perhaps four more thrusts before her world exploded .	when
1	131249	Team is nicknamed as a steel bolt .	The players violently discharge like a full crimson shock wave of deadly fighting force energythen ( slams his fist into palm ) bam you ( chuckles .	because
4	82132	It moved across my upper thighs , lightly stroking from hip to hip .	The feather finally came .	when
4	6767	They are looking at the sky , crystal blue and amazingly clear .	You see them up .	when
2	124863	When he spotted me , his eyes lit up , and .	I could tell that he was just as happy as i was .	but
2	129864	I wanted to bask in this feeling for as long as possible .	I was heavy , so i rolled to my side , taking her with me .	but
0	19662	I had never lived .	It was certainly going to be lonely .	and
0	120126	The smell of something delicious from the kitchen drifted down the stairs .	Iona 's stomach rumbled , her insatiable hunger raising its head .	and
4	105970	That barbara had in front of her .	She left those two phone messages .	when
2	22058	I 've spent a good chunk of the money on becca 's treatment , and the rest i could return to you .	I have no way to repay you .	but
2	50622	Since i was incapitated , i lost the fight .	I was still pleased .	but
1	71926	I think hes afraid of me .	He doesnt talk to me .	because
0	15481	Then rolling his eyes .	Shaking his head at another use of his new favorite word .	and
2	146263	All the stones started lifting from her chest like .	Just as she began to tense up , the necklace floated back down , cool to the touch .	but
0	54028	They 'll reason that if sigmund could turn against his own queen , then a vampire surely could ... . '' .	They were punished by sigmund , every day .	and
2	39093	The gown she wore was more elaborate than reece thought possible .	It paled in comparison to her physical beauty ; which alone was put in the shade by the kindness and good humor of her expression .	but
4	33226	She had two glasses of blood with her .	She returned for my breakfast dishes .	when
1	10490	I can see that .	You 're squeezing the ever-loving life out of me .	because
3	65602	I 'm going to suffocate .	We stay here any longer .	if
3	145323	It 'd be open season on her and she 'd end up on a slab in the morgue next to that poor woman missing a heart .	She ran around atlanta without her powers .	if
4	78053	I no sooner gasped , no , out of my mouth .	She inhaled deep and nearly retched all over the place .	when
4	5288	We worked but when no one was around us , it was joke time or time to catch up on the rumors .	Work was to be done .	when
2	95283	She pulled away from me .	Held my arms , keeping me from doing anything other than rocking to the rhythm .	but
1	3903	It was awkward at .	It had been years since we had talked , and even longer since i had been properly sociable towards them .	because
0	81538	The man was twice his weight the hill was working against him .	I ran forward , dancing back when trent tried to lever his attacker over his head , but .	and
0	96968	He did do that .	He had been doing it for a long time without even realizing it .	and
1	77219	How things would stay .	Then i would never have to find out what i have to do .	because
0	98441	Where the weres shed their human skin .	Let their wolves come out to play .	and
4	9517	It came to an end way too soon in joyahs mind ( though really they had been gone for an hour .	Vily came to find them .	when
0	39488	He just laughed , having a good time .	Smiled along with me .	and
3	127756	How will you guarantee he wont be harmed .	I agree to do this .	if
2	98724	I only have a handful of helpers .	The holidays are a busy time for us .	but
3	159656	He 'd tell you ! ' .	Only you people would track down the thief .	if
4	151502	Stacking them by the front door .	I wandered into the kitchen .	when
2	6141	The pain will be unbearable until he does .	... he 'll live .	but
3	74515	It sounded as if romain was asking what francis had been like as a child .	Dustin had known he was dangerous .	if
0	17415	I opened my eyes , maybe five years old .	Looked at a little wallet-sized portrait of a dark-eyed child .	and
0	13176	The master told me to keep an eye on the alorns about five thousand years .	It 's turned into a full-time job .	and
3	20310	It would destroy you .	You let her die .	if
0	9361	Hiding in the house .	Waiting for them to come .	and
2	23490	Tabitha drew her dagger from its sheathe .	Left it under her pillow .	but
0	149164	These marks could be hours old , which meant he would have had hours of healing behind him .	Yet he was still marred and wounded .	and
2	155996	Dont tell anyone i said .	This season is wearing me out .	but
4	114483	It is , '' she said .	He gave her a look .	when
3	133647	He 'd have wondered .	Anything could grow more complicated than thinking his friends hated him .	if
0	92088	His jaw and ears were aching as if he had been struck on the head .	Temeraire 's body was still trembling beneath him .	and
2	88315	I was used to this .	She was n't . .	but
2	138934	All them kinda dvds and cell phones and microwaves .	Still , we know a lot .	but
3	5255	I had no clue .	They 'd found my mother a donor or if the surgery had been scheduled .	if
2	108170	I had pointed out to him that he was welcome to sit on the furniture , and that i wouldnt bite him .	He said he preferred the floor , and so did the cat .	but
3	80247	Ill kick your fanny out of this inn .	I catch you doing anything illegal .	if
0	90670	Anna bared her neck to her .	Sofia dug her fangs in and took a sip .	and
4	91894	I needed to share it with someone , and i think that you 're a man who can appreciate what i 'm experiencing .	I felt the baby move .	when
4	160117	Snatching the bag from her sister , lil let out a relieved breath .	She opened it and pulled out a paper .	when
4	86388	To pass the time .	Dr. demarco 's voice rang out .	when
2	110117	However , her skin was pink and smooth .	There was one draw back , she was unable to grow hair .	but
3	29024	Now in the attire god gave her , she calmly inquired .	I had any bubble bath .	if
3	68753	Mom youre doing it wrong .	You think sex is like milk .	if
2	83722	You might not understand it and you just keep going .	You might not know where it will lead .	but
0	9837	She is azor ahai returned ... ... '' `` do i have to be reborn in this same body ? '' .	Her triumph over darkness will bring a summer that will never end ... death itself will bend its knee , and all those who die fighting in her cause shall be reborn .	and
0	73452	You have to be very careful , because there 's all sorts of news from the hyperreality zone .	In your case all of it comes inside black borders .	and
3	52384	To work instead of taking the bus .	I ride my bike .	if
2	100847	Well , thank you for the invitation . '' .	It 's a little f**king .	but
0	100423	They turned to leave .	He looked down at marit and affectionately pet her hair .	and
2	14776	There was a line at the door .	Hunter went right past it .	but
0	136693	There had been several pauses several numbers missed , before someone moved on to the next number .	The count went up to twenty-four , but .	and
1	100340	Came the ready reply .	You are bogans son .	because
0	138373	She is just a yeoman .	Has not received training to run the weapons station .	and
0	13348	Kurik 's eldest son had snubbed faran 's head up close to a birch tree .	Was carefully inspecting the big roan 's hooves .	and
4	140860	He actually had been out of the country .	Two of the attacks occurred .	when
2	139022	The smaller drawer lets me keep up with the washing .	It saves me water and electricity .	but
0	40183	With that , both women gave him a pinkie wave .	Strode past the open iron gate , up the hill , and into the large ... home .	and
0	55089	The other tenants left him .	He did the same .	and
0	49752	Grinding her teeth , she threw a fully charged blaster to dancer .	Then laid down cover fire for him so that he could reach it .	and
0	76889	She blinked up at him , but the truth came out .	She meant to say yes .	and
2	131958	Andrew had invited him to the sinclair mansion 's game room for a round of pool and it had only taken a few pointed questions on nathan 's part to get to the real scheme .	Presented the double date as his idea .	but
3	138717	`` , i 'll list reasons .	You want me to list reasons .	if
3	23523	`` , you ask me .	You have a question .	if
3	90752	`` but i warned you . '' .	I gag , remember .	if
3	51337	He could be home in just over an hour .	He stopped at the store down the street .	if
2	105833	It had probably once been a brilliant white .	It had faded into a dingy cream .	but
0	16056	According to sam , cristiano was very protective of his sister .	Had never liked other guys being around her .	and
0	148244	*** vianez heard a series of cries .	Felt a release of pressure from her chest .	and
1	132930	She caught a glimpse of my bra .	When i glanced up at her , she flicked her eyes .	because
3	154359	You will come to me .	It gets to be too much , okay .	if
2	86290	I scowl at him .	Part of me wants to run up and hug him-thank him for saving me by giving me the necklace .	but
4	103787	Jonas nearly jumped out of his skin .	The cell phone in his pocket rang .	when
0	41368	The kid was game .	Mack 's respect for him grew .	and
0	18125	Ctuchik dropped a few hints to his grolims after urvon landed in hagga .	His priests have been spreading wild stories all over southern cthol murgos about drunken mallorean soldiers breaking into murgo houses and raping murgo women .	and
1	49026	Well , you 're one lucky girl .	This is the most secret fishing spot around .	because
0	77281	Before aricles could move , haides ripped his helm off his head .	Threw it to the ground .	and
3	153878	His crew and their families fed for a while .	The place she found was ratty .	if
2	95041	Yes you could be .	Let us leave that for after the ceremony , when we begin their training .	but
2	92019	At the bottom , they could only see as far as the lights .	As they rose toward the surface , the ocean changed from pitch black to a kind of twilight that slowly got brighter as they neared the surface .	but
2	90492	I 'm scared of everything .	I 'm mostly scared of losing you .	but
0	144624	Her lips are shriveled .	Both eye sockets have inverted-the eyeballs themselves .	and
0	91565	Wave of sickness rolled over me .	I shook my head , cracking my neck as i violently tried to throw off whatever had a hold on me .	and
2	105890	The methods may not have much in common . '' .	They have to be connected .	but
3	130496	Which you will be .	You go through with this .	if
0	47792	The first breath he took was loud gasping , and .	He thrust himself up off the floor , eyes wild .	and
3	134722	He wonders , but i 'm glad he is .	He should tease me about it .	if
2	90054	I dont know why we have been so blessed .	We will never forget it , raven replied .	but
2	74731	His hand immediately gripped mine .	What made my eyes shoot up to him incredulously was how he also managed to caress my fingers at the same time .	but
0	39134	Ran joey by a mile .	I heaved it to him .	and
0	76790	Then survival instincts kicked in .	A jolt of adrenaline sent them racing even faster .	and
4	136342	But , no one wanted to ride a sweaty train with a pack of strangers .	Cars were invented and everyone could have their own private transport .	when
3	65939	We are kind of .	Even you could just heal yourself up .	if
2	154070	Most of the guests had driven back to their respective homes .	The castle entrance hall was still full of the more exalted citizens of merhaine .	but
3	66	He would have been shocked by the change .	He were suddenly allowed to be happy .	if
0	28772	Lucinda looked over to her husband with a smirky smile .	Laughed a little more than marc liked as she turned back to lynn and nodded .	and
3	80193	Exactly what she needed .	Especially they brought out that spreader thingee .	if
0	36758	She walked to the end of the street .	Followed the bluff path to the weathered cabin that walker called home .	and
4	119307	His lips stretched into a smile along my belly button .	He said our unborn son 's name .	when
2	113873	To drag you half way round the world .	We have a little job to do .	but
0	18594	The air was colder than it should be the clouds were dark and menacing .	It was late fall , but .	and
0	56254	`` as a matter of fact , today 's unlike any day i 've ever seen - . '' .	I 've seen a lot of them .	and
0	29414	When he saw her frightened face was alert , luke slid his arm around her waist .	Started pulling her up the stairs next to him .	and
4	142383	She came running outside .	My mother saw me climbing out of my brother 's car .	when
0	72889	Belle looked to his ear then to the knot in his tie then with a great deal of effort , she forced her eyes to his . '' .	Said , `` no , um ... '' she hesitated then rushed on , `` i was wondering if we could have dinner .	and
0	80508	Then he remembered a spell from the book arek .	He had bought that was full of magical spells .	and
2	130914	Telling her to hold on .	She kept staring at me .	but
2	77163	I hear the words .	Id already seen the truth of them in his eyes before he spoke .	but
0	147219	The creature picks king .	Lays her gently on the bunk .	and
4	58462	She again motioned to phillippe who knew exactly what he was supposed to do .	Mapita saw this stash of bills .	when
0	68125	He pushed back the top of her dress .	Became intent on undoing her corset .	and
2	16892	The new jp president do whatever he wanted .	Him to do too much might raise suspicion .	but
1	48980	Of course , ill be helping .	Were going to live .	because
2	52629	It did not come crashing .	Stopped in midair as if standing there waiting for a command .	but
3	15652	When the wind howls the mountains remain unmoved , however , it will wear down the mountain .	The wind is precise and persistent .	if
4	80210	Mk grabbed quatze by the wrist and silently dragged him into the doorway .	He was sure his companion wouldnt speak .	when
2	44746	The wetware still experiences damage from the radiation , and they are unable to override their programming that forces them to keep running the plants .	The artificial intelligence units still experience suffering .	but
3	26135	He would have strapped huge weapons to his legs .	The gun laws had let him .	if
0	137274	So i sat there and .	Watched the dozens of other tourists laughing and smiling and drinking , waiting for the show to start .	and
0	88430	Once tyhreb was comfortable , lozan was able to get urthaj to his feet .	They ran around the meadow like rabbits , grabbing all the herbs they could and went back to the citadel .	and
2	25497	It was hard to discern between true intentions and crafted bullshit .	I 'd like to think i guessed .	but
3	24581	`` ... '' `` i can .	You can really see it that way .	if
2	149758	She worked from nine until three each day managing a large dental office .	She 'd taken the week off to spend with him and had kept christopher out of day care .	but
2	65993	She 'd called out to rafe and kade .	They had disappeared into tal 's recovery room .	but
3	156104	We will have one .	We want a baby .	if
0	94609	Coonhil closed it behind them .	Remained standing at the front edge of the room .	and
0	4250	Those tiny almost-curls stirred in the breeze .	Made her want to run her fingers through them .	and
2	110573	She did her best to follow his instructions .	It was his expert maneuvering that got her into the position he desired .	but
4	60581	A third pair of hands twist around me .	I scream and fight with my arms and legs .	when
0	93548	I never had a pet before for myself .	He wont be neglected .	and
2	22819	Remington is fighting up there , and .	I 'm not going anywhere until he 's ready to leave .	but
1	63349	If she does , itll be .	She beat the best out .	because
0	18269	I had a spare minute . '' .	Thought i 'd check on you .	and
2	45729	Brother john told mrs. james that they would always love me .	He and his wife had to protect their daughter , laura ( my former best friend ) , from making similarly bad choices .	but
1	104163	The way and the villagers seemed interested to see so many armed soldiers marching through their square , but not alarmed by it .	Possibly they recognized morrow .	because
2	133424	`` i know , '' rhodar admitted glumly , `` .	Our only hope of escape is breaking through those lines that have us blocked off .	but
1	8049	That makes you feel better .	We 're over i 'm a coward .	because
0	140159	To get married to ellasbeth .	Be what everyone needs you to be .	and
1	28296	Arent evident to you .	You live with it day in and day .	because
2	99048	The first ambulance arrived next and there was nothing they could do .	Was directed to saunders .	but
0	56978	He had gone back to his white uniforms .	Stood with a commanding posture despite his obvious frustration .	and
4	113633	Preferred actually to sit in filth then to let george st. clair help her up .	She didnt take his hand .	when
0	101403	He belonged to her .	No one would ever take him .	and
2	48616	Asked shane three dead in crafers .	We dont know how far this tom-cats been roaming .	but
4	74271	That came to me .	I saw your photo .	when
2	126905	Mom , i love you .	I cant keep causing discord in our family by trying to mold myself into something that i will never be .	but
4	131165	You become suspicious of everything .	You find out someone 's trying to kill you .	when
2	47460	`` mother , did you -- '' and jeremy had to run to catch her .	Kathryn was already halfway up the stairs .	but
0	31967	I exited the elevator .	Walked over to the front desk where a man was now working .	and
0	120336	Alone , unsure of myself , and so young i looked up at the slippers .	They began to glow .	and
0	50960	It grew , slowly but .	It grew bigger , its weight increased with it .	and
0	109273	She stacked up the pillows .	Used it to support her back `` what are they waiting for .	and
0	116509	Death is a part of life .	I agree with quentoris intentions .	and
3	71582	`` '' was her only response .	You think that 's necessary .	if
3	158515	It would be me that bought it .	It was a question of him or me .	if
0	79949	Now my jeans were dusty .	My cute shoes were officially dirty .	and
0	75219	When his niece holly arrived tomorrow , he 'd dump the stuff on her .	The overjoyed kid would be occupied with bubbles all week out in the front yard , weather permitting , and leave him to the sacred peace of his back yard or the quiet sanctity of his study .	and
2	49611	Blayle did not get to see any of the other traders .	He looked pleased enough , especially when he glanced across the way at the bored looking berrycake makers from kohr springs .	but
2	43017	I know i seem .	I have excellent hearing .	but
2	151933	Finally i insisted we return home .	There matters soon grew even worse than .	but
0	39160	Nevertheless , join with her he would .	Doubtless this would bring its own unpleasantness .	and
2	39839	I saved it for you yesterday .	You came in late .	but
2	4884	The whispers grew louder , indecipherable .	Made up of many voices , all seeming to speak in another language .	but
2	119376	Little by little , the fires dwindled .	The burning heat within his staff remained .	but
2	158928	I was able to fight them off with the help of my son .	That was going on was there a security officer in sight .	but
2	84248	The first shot missed .	The second nailed him in the right shoulder .	but
2	5065	The crowd was disappointed .	There was confusion on all sides , with many crying the name of little st. william .	but
3	128586	Well then youre going to love this , atreus replied as he turned and walked up to the gold-adorned , double doors in front of them .	You didnt hear what i said .	if
0	98722	She saw wolf smile .	Inwardly she was smiling .	and
4	139513	He blew his top .	He saw the glasses .	when
4	115725	Chapter 46 flaherty rolled out of bed .	The alarm sounded and made his way to the shower .	when
2	60577	That had been mckie 's first clue to aritch 's actual motives and the word lesson had bothered him .	He 'd missed the implications .	but
2	130018	Still be nothing a cocksucking coward .	You could be a big , loud noise with a tough attitude and a face full of piercings and a snarl to show the world ... and .	but
3	30901	He always doubted his own resolve .	He had been in their position .	if
2	66738	Cos if id waited to be called up , i couldve ended up in the infantry .	By volunteering i was able to wangle my way into the service corps , get it .	but
2	73462	I dont know what rumors michelle was referring to .	Ive heard some crazy ones that had absolutely no basis in reality .	but
0	12535	Grandpa smedry pulled open his tuxedo jacket .	Removed two pairs of spectacles .	and
3	35783	Some fresh meat they had picked up along the way would have to wait for supper and a good fire .	Mr. clancy would permit it .	if
2	136364	I assumed construction workers , coming in and out of the main area .	I expended no mental energy noticing them .	but
3	127604	To be more cautious .	You were dating a cop .	if
2	101720	She jerked wildly , trying to break free .	He twisted her around and marched her back to the officer 's desk and slammed her down into the chair .	but
0	150627	Her heart jolted with excitement as his arms slid around her .	She was tugged firmly against his body .	and
2	63322	It certainly was not the sort of thing we find in every town we sack and burn .	Just how well it fished , he 'd yet to learn .	but
3	18788	As lina suggested , it would be atum .	Anyone was going to be hanged .	if
2	36649	I stood in a stand of night-black trees .	Close by , the front lights of the dorms glowed .	but
2	49238	Chaiko sympathised with him .	Said he had to heal this unexpected rift growing in the clan .	but
2	98744	The trials of life were always waiting when the day was .	Those summer work days were irreplaceable .	but
4	159940	Quickly skipping two questions so that he could double-check his answers .	The answers did not immediately come to mind and marking three others .	when
2	398	She had always hated taking any medicine .	Maybe she should take a pill tonight , she was so damn tired she could barely see straight .	but
1	120082	`` , have both told me something else entirely . '' .	What i see in your eyes , and what i feel in your touch .	because
2	136189	He could go off in another direction .	He could be lost forever without knowing where to travel .	but
3	105983	Wont do any damage to his character .	He sing as well as he avoids capture by arthritic dragons .	if
4	115060	I took a different direction .	He continued to stare at me .	when
1	133395	And you can forget using the wetlands and barrier reefs as a buffer .	They 're all but gone .	because
4	81684	That grew into fingers of terror .	Her breathing became labored .	when
3	119848	I was sure the heat between them would start to dissipate .	Sienna would just say something .	if
2	34513	Quickly there would be no chance of saving the citadel , and so risk injuring or even killing some of its innocent citizens .	To withstand this new assault he would have to fire the cannon at targets within the walls of forli itself .	but
4	97178	We will use the jelly beans , trail mix , and peanuts , if we are forced to abandon the aircraft .	We need to travel .	when
4	25728	He held his hand out to me .	I sat down next to him .	when
1	134909	Olivia must have had the tea steeping .	She returned in only a few minutes with a tray bearing the pot , cups , cream , sugar , and a plate of the cookies .	because
0	130223	We held each other 's gaze a moment .	Then he slammed the door in my face .	and
0	62715	He slowly stood up .	Moved to the object .	and
0	23268	The dangling hose ignites .	A flame quickly climbs to the top where the fire spreads .	and
1	64311	Is it true someone came on your property saturday the 29th of march and shot your horse cara , i believe her name was , dead .	He tried to recover himself in the next sentence .	because
4	135311	We had made love .	We had the chance .	when
0	78619	That night jaklin and mikhail , in their dreams , left millennium road .	Traveled east to the chateau .	and
2	15866	My fate was already decided .	At least i could have some say in the timing of it .	but
0	61789	Their lord was dead burned and the new king that had come to them in the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark and terrible for any might or valour to conquer .	Dead lay the king of rohan in their citadel .	and
4	13813	He abruptly shut up .	He saw lissa and me .	when
0	129279	Finn gets vampire killer arrows , i get a stick .	You get a lightsaber axe .	and
0	160692	Then he considered for a moment .	Knew it wouldnt make any difference to him .	and
3	84653	When you had the chance .	Only you 'd staked her . '' .	if
2	72827	`` i 'm expensive , '' liv had joked the day she left .	Neither perry nor his best friend , roar , had laughed .	but
4	11580	You 'll understand that i 'll walk all over anyone who keeps me from protecting you . '' .	You understand just how much you mean to me .	when
2	66248	I went to join my father .	He shook his head and then held up his hand , bringing me to a halt .	but
0	40639	Barely missing them , it rolled across the manicured shrubs .	Slammed against the wall on nick 's left .	and
2	5184	He 'd said she was a natural .	She 'd never actually gotten this far before , so never had the chance to test her skills .	but
2	58965	She was not so well as he would wish her .	There was nothing to suggest the remotest suspicion of danger .	but
3	155235	Then all he had to worry about were the other security guards , and maybe the janitors , blowing his cover .	It were common practice to ignore the working class employees .	if
2	120549	Cain and verin laughed .	She and nehemia walked away , the princess holding her hand .	but
4	58923	That emanated from his office .	He opened the special delivery .	when
3	43988	You can go for the fame .	You think you probably wont get the wealth .	if
2	140328	Everyone thought elena and meredith were so clever and so strong .	Bonnie had saved the day again and again - not that anyone ever remembered that .	but
0	99469	She vented a wordless , furious denial .	Twisted her arm in my hold .	and
2	1273	'' she whispered , and ... blue .	Watched in a kind of awe as her breath smoked not sickly green-gray .	but
3	150798	They will continue their investigation at their headquarters .	The tax is not paid .	if
0	67871	He pointed his staff at the dragon .	Shouted , aknor stellara .	and
2	95380	Betelgeuse holds his horn in his lap , even the blues .	He is too depressed to play anything at the moment .	but
0	115239	The moon really did shine in her eyes .	Helped him see his future .	and
0	158775	When seth had made it to the chairs , she threw him his shirt .	Dragged a cooler of drinks between them .	and
2	51341	Mentioned any of this to john .	She was to find out more she would need his help and support .	but
1	17436	Demonstrated by the common wood frog .	The subjects are completely dehydrated prior to being frozen .	because
0	57419	He roared like the lion , baring his fingers like claws , gave me a hundred kisses .	Then scooped me up in his arms .	and
2	74839	She 'd braided her hair to give it a semblance of neatness .	Could do nothing about her ragged nails .	but
0	153230	Caspian opened the door .	Led them into a cabin which filled the stern underneath the deck cabins in the poop .	and
3	55723	Still , he had a presence about him , a commanding sort of air that probably made people promise him their first-born .	Only he 'd give them a moment of his time .	if
4	62053	They will padlock the bulkhead door , the front and back doors , and the shed-garage .	They leave the house .	when
2	57819	There 's no triumph over a corpse .	A beaten opponent , who will remain beaten every day of the remainder of their sad and wretched life , is something to treasure .	but
2	66083	I still had no idea what it was supposed to mean , and that if and when i called callum , nothing i had to say would surprise him in the least .	I was positive that it did mean something .	but
3	59901	He needed to keep me alive , so hed used her .	He wanted to find brianna .	if
3	119963	I would have probably not heard him with rome shouting at the top of his lungs in the house .	I were not a therian .	if
3	43883	The day was fine and warmer than the one .	Even the ground was still soggy after the brief snowfall .	if
2	141791	Voak blocked the attack .	Even he couldnt deny the power of the blow .	but
0	98750	He was not so weary-looking .	The ruddy blotches which had marred his face then had cleared .	and
0	153263	You step on that mat , and the electric motors open the doors for you .	The doors know you want in .	and
0	15829	Arms draped over the sides , bubbles floating over and around her .	She belonged to him .	and
3	24897	She must be coherent .	Were going to do this .	if
2	129403	She should be furious at his assumption .	Since she 'd been flirting openly , that would be hypocritical .	but
0	78096	Then he was in me .	It felt so damn good i groaned .	and
2	55262	She tried to keep her tone sweet .	Her eyes were cold and angry .	but
0	71756	He loved both of his jobs , but nothing challenged him .	He was certainly great at them .	and
0	128639	I threw my head .	Screamed his name to the heavens .	and
0	27329	Slowly and methodically i returned each root and branch to its original position .	Let the tree rest peacefully , balanced once again deep within the earth .	and
0	61755	That would only arouse suspicion .	The affects might not last .	and
0	35705	It was not affected by the elements .	It withstood the ravages of the deadliest radiation and even the burning fires of a sun .	and
4	38291	It was mostly in times .	He would mumble incoherently to himself .	when
0	12803	`` we are so screwed , '' faye said .	Cassie noticed her reach for the pendant .	and
2	4498	Heard amaranth and she was no match for either of us .	Felt her arms around me .	but
3	125278	However , he thought one must accept it .	One is presented with the upper hand in battle .	if
4	43297	The pharmacist had been at a meeting .	He arrived and that her assistant had convinced him to wait until she got .	when
3	101479	Then why are you working with the death walkers .	The world 's fate depends on that .	if
2	87261	They waited , tense and on edge .	There was nothing more .	but
2	103234	He stepped forward into me .	I hardly noticed , my concentration focused on the target .	but
4	20888	The expression on his face told her exactly how he felt about her , and she realized that what had once been uncomfortable was now the response she craved .	She kissed him once in the midst of hammering .	when
2	46295	The image of that harpy throwing herself at elliot was playing on repeat in the back of my mind .	I was adding things to it .	but
4	41445	Selected from the census .	That frightful birthday arrived .	when
2	47392	Through various stratagems , she managed to keep this revulsion from her parents .	In the end , their attack became incessant , and the only way to ensure both her own lifestyle and accommodate the hopes of her parents was to get married .	but
2	31466	She 'd been dying then , and he 'd heard her .	Her voice had been weak .	but
0	66444	Getting gwenvael off the floor .	Fetching cold cloths for her father and uncles ' heads .	and
2	106512	Remember , mccoy said , regular ammo will slow them down .	It wont kill them .	but
1	145237	It must have been during the night , signore .	I personally saw niccol here yesterday in the late afternoon .	because
0	2004	She struck the surface .	Broke through , into a world of brutal cold and gasping suffocation .	and
3	43002	No , but i wouldnt be surprised .	You told me you did .	if
0	32694	He was thick in his shoulders .	Starting to be almost muscular .	and
0	9217	The hallway was a confusion of fur .	Snarling , yelps and roars .	and
3	121912	That 's going to be a tough nut to crack .	Those are sharans up there '' .	if
0	13319	But that was half a mile .	Would be out of sight of any house they built .	and
4	149874	Me meredith at the beginning .	He first got to l.a .	when
3	139079	I 'd probably learn a lot more and stay out of trouble .	You 'd just take me along on some of your missions .	if
0	138892	`` you just do , '' jack replied .	She made a noise that sounded like she was being strangled so he leaned toward her .	and
2	90659	The office had a couch .	Dana had never laid down on it .	but
2	60857	I 'm crazy about you .	Right now i 'm going to f**k you like i hate you .	but
4	159323	To close my eyes and pretend youre someone .	I have to fight you .	when
2	33579	Because i could not strike him , chosen , i had many attempts on his life .	I could not strike him .	but
2	147824	I 'm sure elias sugarcoated me with his bias and all .	If this story is going to be told , then it needs to be told in its truth and entirety , without band-aids and training wheels .	but
3	37465	I 'll go over there and not help her . '' .	You know what i mean .	if
4	88125	Knew that was laid out before me . '' .	I made the pros .	when
3	111834	If they know , they 'll ... they 'll leave me .	It 's not hidden .	if
2	48779	Trying not to laugh at carthinals discomfort .	When he reached in , he could not lift the sword at all .	but
3	151779	Why kill my entire family .	I was the only thing the sentinels wanted .	if
4	93018	Bit back a groan .	Her teeth closed over it .	when
0	20203	The bedspread was green quilted and slick , and .	The picture above the bed was a bridge somewhere in europe , looked like .	and
2	93709	I eyed the remote .	Decided against turning the tv back on .	but
4	1533	I just want to get naked , get into bed , and spend the rest of the time being with my hot little sex toy .	We get to the cabin .	when
4	52620	Mr. long signaled for her to wait .	They reached the edge of it .	when
2	101642	He told them this .	They refused to get the message .	but
2	99359	She has never seen him resolute or forceful before in any manner .	He is suddenly composed and one hundred percent business now , as he adds , that i am coming with you .	but
4	22726	To touch that knot of nerves , the swollen button that would set me free , i knew i was .	I used my other hand .	when
2	127179	I am manufactured to obey .	The extent of my obedience is myself to determine .	but
3	40404	A few days we enlisted for training he clasped his hands with a certain gravity as he began .	It would be best i begin with the esston attack on gahon military base which occurred sometime near the end of last year .	if
3	139353	Such a miracle , i 'd notify the vatican , no joke .	I was a catholic .	if
0	82369	Him standing outside the red dragon talking to stasha .	When she went to go get him , he took off with her .	and
1	74522	I hoped he enjoyed the show .	He was going to get a front-row seat for round two .	because
4	123568	Kennedy reminded herself of other happy-ever-afters .	She lay awake at night , not able to sleep .	when
2	52812	Danny wanted to complain to the supervisor .	We told him he better leave it alone or hed end up spending a night in jail , or worse .	but
0	108753	In italy , one married for one 's parents .	Sought lovers for oneself .	and
4	77147	Smythe was supposed to be on duty at the hospital and rafferty could imagine the porter 's shifty eyes out on stalks .	He saw smythe in the pub .	when
2	2207	Laurel just spun around and , leaving emma alone in the darkness .	Marched up the stairs .	but
2	129444	She thought she felt him kiss her forehead .	She couldnt be sure .	but
0	142441	That once was an attic .	Was now half full of mud .	and
0	128433	You must try to see him .	Have an explanation with him .	and
0	52028	Then he flipped it .	When he saw what it was , he laughed .	and
0	56648	The vehicles grind to a halt on the edge of the site .	At least thirty people climb out .	and
4	35672	She stopped pressing his wound .	He ogled at the injury and snorted .	when
0	71003	`` his eyes , '' jace said , raising his witchlight .	Shining it into mark 's face .	and
0	54656	His was a terrible choice .	He hadnt a clue of conway dukes neat trap .	and
2	24050	He wants to be friends .	Then he initiates what just happened .	but
2	139458	I can tear up the cushion and .	Felt pads that line the benches .	but
2	155407	Tears should have been forming .	They did n't . .	but
4	115171	Them to breathe they finally admitted defeat and left the planet behind for good .	The air became too bad . '' .	when
4	100050	I come in a beemer .	She 's expectin ' a monte carlo .	when
4	81486	He did not like to be noticed-were troubled , or made uncomfortable , or found themselves unaccountably scared .	He was about his business-and .	when
0	127706	Meera caught a blind white fish with her frog spear .	It was time to climb .	and
2	5867	He made a pass at me and . '' .	He 's old enough to be my father .	but
2	130373	Some people call me a black panther .	My baby , she knows the way i sound a few minutes before midnight , the moon pierced the black sky like a bulls-eye on a desert stage .	but
2	9792	`` he 's fine , '' she said , `` . '' .	If he wants to stay that way , i suggest he get up and come with us before the sheriff realizes you 've escaped the hotel .	but
0	90477	Does she eat birdseed .	Sit on a perch .	and
2	105841	You may not have an ava in your past .	You damn sure have a craig , which is probably worse .	but
4	2734	I asked phil if he could get his brother to ride the bike round to mine when we finished on the friday .	I got to school .	when
3	47002	They could make the arrangements for him right then and .	He was to be flying .	if
2	41364	At that moment not only did i want to curl up and die .	I thought i was already dead .	but
2	101002	I could see she was trying to control herself .	There was rage brewing in her .	but
1	88963	She must have been watching for him .	She threw the door open before he could ring the bell .	because
3	108812	It would add up , but he had n't . .	Her father had made cash withdrawals and flown to vegas .	if
4	135939	Indeed she could tell it went undetected .	She slipped a ten-dollar bill from the matchbox into her palm .	when
3	75068	I would feel more comfortable . '' .	You sat down while we talk .	if
3	101605	He could really have something and no one would be the wiser .	He uses accidents and covers all of the united states , not hitting in the same place .	if
3	125993	And , there 's really no better place . '' .	You 're going to dispose of a body in florida .	if
0	9662	Complete with recitation of its traditional poetic version , which laurence suspected lost a great deal of color in the translation , carried them past the gate , and full of children and hatchlings .	Some distance along the avenue towards a broad grey-flagged plaza set back from the road itself .	and
0	70782	She uncrossed her arms .	Balled her fists at her side .	and
4	101351	It seemed to always do .	She was getting heated .	when
4	111948	They had died two days .	A land mine exploded under their vehicle outside of baghdad .	when
4	41431	The only other ships docked had been .	Shed left the previous day .	when
0	150616	He had fought against the temptation to hate rich people .	He had felt genuine compassion for the karnak fragment in its agony .	and
2	33295	I make less money , and do stress-free stuff like real estate closings and wills .	I take on clients i like .	but
0	87860	Someone bring me a variety of eyepatches .	Someone else burn that hat '' .	and
4	108096	You won ' t know anybody .	You go away to college .	when
4	137313	It reminded her of him .	She gazed at its face .	when
1	112084	He 'd had to turn to other women .	I 'm frigid in bed .	because
3	23079	Chris could probably take him back and join us .	He wants to quit .	if
1	63681	Then she turned the conversation onto us .	Maybe shed noticed my lets-get-going signals .	because
4	74644	They walked back outside , intent to meet them as soon as they arrived .	They failed to find the mercenary leader or any of the others .	when
0	155691	Then i moved up to his chest .	Did the same thing .	and
0	114763	There was no reasoning with the old woman , for when they tried to question her about what had happened to dunstan , all her talk was of one of the prizes of her collection , given away by a good-for-nothing .	That was what came of ingratitude , and of these sad modern times , and of today 's servants .	and
2	54289	Not only were there three of them , on horseback .	They knew where they were .	but
4	117836	He took it out on her . '' .	He was frustrated at work .	when
4	105304	My mother used to give me .	She had pumped me for information .	when
2	42257	The men might not hear the silenced explosion , like he had witnessed it while peering through the houses front windows .	Ashe was positive that they would see the muzzle flash .	but
3	16482	Her outspokenness finished the job .	He 'd thought her coffee was enough to send his system into shock .	if
0	47596	She watched him crawl onto the bed .	Knew her virginity would soon be a memory .	and
3	21105	She would have finished him .	She 'd thought of a way .	if
2	154835	I should be quite happy if i knew that you heard from her : ; and my beautiful guest , i do feel the responsibility , unaided by advice from your mother .	This evening the accounts of the progress of the mysterious disease that has invaded our neighborhood , grow even more alarming .	but
2	19462	I never realized when it happened .	I notice my right hand reaching toward him .	but
0	128736	The blisters on his skin had even faded , just from the scent of her .	Though he was tired , he could function .	and
3	35129	But as the door closed behind the ivory train of the eyllwe princess , celaena wondered .	She 'd been wrong .	if
4	65461	Her mother was above her .	She opened her eyes .	when
0	142006	I could speak their language .	Could make sure that they had everything they needed .	and
0	155775	Worthy fellow met with a bad end when the station was shelled .	It fell to me to direct the removal of the wounded to a place of safety .	and
2	36024	Suspected that they werent good from the brief glimpses of the crashing waves and hellish winds i had witnessed when i checked on him .	I was still hopeful that the boat might have kept to its timescale .	but
0	57289	Gan and sylah broke away , riding to join the community .	It was when they arrived and dismounted to mingle with the larger group that the factionalism within the tribe crystallized .	and
0	105776	Her fingers shook along with her breath .	She realized his hands were moving at his own waist and she put her attention to helping him .	and
2	103216	He had almost told her .	A couple of things had held him .	but
2	145589	Yeah , pudge is adorable .	You want incorrigible / so jake is more endurable / 'cause he 's so-damn .	but
2	11484	Know how good a shot hauser was .	That was the great thing about using an mp40 .	but
0	62192	Enacting the scene where the guide is a child .	He performs his first miracle by curing a dying man .	and
2	9838	I now realize i had always been destined to join the dark army .	You robbed my of my destiny .	but
2	93454	My heart was still racing and i was no longer terrified .	It felt like id just walked in from a torrential downpour .	but
0	24300	My hands wandered slowly to his waist .	He slid my dress up , his fingers hot on my bare skin , making me breathless .	and
0	152668	Pretending was a waste of everyone 's time .	I had endured hell to keep mine .	and
3	73782	Oh , okay i 'd hide behind anything .	My life was on the line .	if
4	138857	You never know . '' .	It will keep you alive .	when
2	24197	The blinds were still closed and decided against it .	He considered going back to sleep .	but
0	7543	But the girl is my daughter . '' .	I have no doubt that once she is left with no one , she will come running to her father , to her family .	and
3	85909	Spend time with , make love to , that he 'd never truly know if it was his money or him she wanted .	She suddenly decided he was worthy enough to date .	if
2	48376	Tasha broke off her conversation with her brother and , giving a slightly off balance curtsy a curtsy all the same .	Walked up to the queen .	but
2	97020	I was proud of her .	I was also frightened for her .	but
1	125920	I think shes angry with me .	I wont drive her home , or because i talked her into coming to camp with us .	because
3	45807	But , she should probably try to help .	Malcolm turner was in that house and he was as dangerous as sebastian thought .	if
4	133355	I had a few messages .	I turned it on .	when
2	101603	Monitoring the diamond mine via the security feeds .	Luke was kind of apprehensive about asking for an update .	but
0	88060	I grabbed his wrist , twisted , then used an elbow at his neck to knock him unconscious .	Sent him to the ground .	and
4	122872	But , nothing about the situation seemed light .	She saw worry etching deeper in the older man 's face .	when
4	96834	Things might have been a little easier .	She was a child .	when
0	103790	He felt sweat breaking out on his still-clammy skin .	Realized he was trembling .	and
3	81815	He wouldnt be coming out alive .	I only had one guy go in .	if
2	142293	I 've already started working on that.the bowies and roger will go out .	We 'll need a few officers .	but
2	118027	My death would not be my ultimate defeat .	Instead would be their failure to extract from me what they wanted to know .	but
2	111145	I 'd worried about the noise from the hammering , and she 'd said any curious infected kept being drawn the other direction , toward the sound of the gunshots .	Tavia had kept an eye out .	but
2	24084	I 'll do my best .	It will still only be a zombie .	but
0	113500	Now i 'm feeling restless . '' .	Want to do something useful .	and
0	63177	He was dressed in a long coat that was slightly too small for him .	Had a black beret perched incongruously on spiky black hair .	and
4	128041	There is laughter in his eyes .	I meet his gaze .	when
0	156042	Piercing the barriers of his mind .	Striking the depths of his heart and his soul .	and
2	94327	He knew the place well by .	Hoped that this would be the last time he would have to look around it .	but
4	139446	He considered writing to you .	He found out what dottie intended .	when
4	151195	I realized that i 'd been crying all .	I reached up to brush away an escaping tear .	when
2	49542	Manfred knew the people at his table were talking .	They might as well have been making paper chains for all he knew .	but
4	74146	We swore up and down she 'd been home with us .	Laurel almost got busted messing with the twelve-foot holiday tree at la encantada .	when
0	134458	I 'm resistant to fire .	Can turn my hands into lights .	and
2	82026	He had no explanation .	He could catch callie 's scent mingled among the warriors .	but
0	116700	To take control of my weak body .	I sat up to look out the window .	and
2	5801	Each sketch was better than the previous one .	Her heart sank at the sight of the black ink scribbled through each masterpiece .	but
4	140003	His father told him .	Asked , that his mother died giving birth to his sister .	when
4	21399	She shrugged at covington .	Nobody responded to sam 's dare .	when
3	50361	We make people angry .	Even we dont have an answer , because hopefully someone smarter than us is watching and maybe they can figure it out .	if
2	32675	The accounts stretched back to when queen elizabeth first formed bur , and there were few references to preternaturals , even less about any female examples of such , and nothing at al about their progeny .	He 'd been scanning through them most of the night .	but
0	102865	Luthen took her hand .	Led her to the corridor .	and
3	28104	We 've got a real chance . '' .	You can stick it till we get .	if
2	45764	There was another smell hovering just below the candy canes .	Tom could not place it .	but
2	157797	We left some garbage and a flag there in the sixties . '' .	That 's about it .	but
2	135277	`` i 'm sorry , mrs cox .	I brought a date with me .	but
4	136852	I closed my eyes in relief .	I saw that he was holding sara , who was making those cute little baby noises and waving her arms .	when
4	153595	She could easily do .	A living being was anywhere within a one hundred-foot radius of her .	when
0	69920	Sold girl scout cookies , helped her build a matchbox car to enter the school race .	Gone on all the father/daughter trips .	and
4	57566	You gave your heart to valentine as children do , and made yourself a part of him .	You were a child .	when
4	105699	- `` `` igorina .	It 's you talking about this sort of thing .	when
2	12825	Michelle repeatedly pulled the sweatshirt down , and it was only about sixty degrees , so frostbite would be a while in coming .	Tucked the little hood around his head .	but
2	140606	She was gasping for breath and the tears kept leaking from her eyes .	Trying to slow her galloping heartbeat .	but
2	31699	Your beef was with peter .	Entire family has been a thorn in your ass for too long , and i love you too much to let this slide .	but
0	82906	Where we could pull over in privacy - a little park that was largely deserted in the cold weather .	Alcide called colonel flood .	and
4	97071	To send you home .	You 're visibly upset .	when
4	47604	There 's plenty of everything to go .	The tourists show up .	when
0	120472	She had been transcribing all morning .	Her shoulders were tight .	and
0	135372	As the slender young coward walked away , the guard entered the room .	Took up position behind me .	and
3	94798	Then im gon na die and go to country girl heaven .	All country girls dance like that .	if
1	124654	Had inadvertently handed them the very prize they had sought .	They had suspected it was made of substance z. henry .	because
1	64516	Im watching his eyes .	Theyre looking at me like hes waiting for me to change my mind .	because
0	81844	I closed my hands into fists .	Stepped toward him , ready to strike .	and
0	80432	A bronze-and-blue delivery droid zoomed past him , two sannos plates in its spiderlike silver arms .	Flew out over the heads of the crowd .	and
0	106193	He takes a thin leather thong from around his neck .	Puts it around hers .	and
0	68191	I watched her gloved hands pressing on my skin .	Had a remembrance , like a flashback in a tv show .	and
0	26158	She is a 2010 graduate of clarion west writers workshop and the speculative literature foundations older writer award in 2012 .	Received the writers of the future award in 2009 .	and
0	109424	As quickly as it came , her rage was gone .	In its place was arousal .	and
2	157622	He turned around and .	Winked at me , like he 'd enjoyed the strippers more than he wanted to let on to charlotte .	but
2	54868	Under other circumstances , he might have looked like an ordinary guy .	Fangs distorted his face and his eyes glowed red in the firelight .	but
2	108777	She should feel uncomfortable with this stranger but couldnt help .	Relax in the company of such rare beauty .	but
3	39057	If bianca succumbed to her injuries or an assassins designs , then hed never get a chance like this .	He left this night and things went .	if
2	93572	We hadnt decided this strategy .	Once under way , it was the obvious way to go .	but
0	62616	He tried to fork another bite into my already-full mouth .	I shook my head and stole the fork from him .	and
4	81933	I meant it . '' .	I said i was just as happy to have you behind the privacy of closed doors and blinds .	when
2	123816	As skipper , he had to make sure the sailboat didnt bury its bow too deeply into the trough and pitch pole , or .	Flip over , end-to-end .	but
2	75774	Much of chelsea was still occupied by the reasonably prosperous .	Our street seemed to have slipped into obscurity some years .	but
0	20624	I turned on my flashlight app was .	I began to search the ground like victor .	and
2	35903	Ok , we will not shout .	You just say one time that you are in love '' i was trying to teach him that some were the things in which we get some better ideas as compared to him .	but
2	22734	Vimes had spent his life on the streets , and he 'd never met the people .	Had met decent men and fools and people who 'd steal a penny from a blind beggar and people who performed silent miracles or desperate crimes every day behind the grubby windows of little houses .	but
3	65588	Softly , so no one else could hear , he said , id have you simply for the pleasure of teaching you a lesson .	You were not a witch .	if
3	17527	He would do it without a second thought .	She asked him to sail across the world to prove his love .	if
3	141411	I mean i 'll never fool them . '' .	Everyone is looking for my illusions .	if
4	137515	Just to sacrifice me .	It was convenient for you .	when
3	93273	'' falonar said softly as he settled in to wait .	It comes down to that .	if
0	34517	If the steel mary showed up , she should abandon her knighthood .	Run the other way .	and
4	99833	Me back-that kept me in la .	It was slowly killing me inside .	when
0	46807	They rose at the back of my throat .	I was bursting with the urge to tell noah everything .	and
0	40829	For that time , all of that force was focused .	Concentrated into a circle perhaps two hundred yards across that embraced the entire gallery and every vampire inside it .	and
2	101631	I thought i heard a loud crash .	My eyelids were too heavy to open .	but
2	2210	I know that you dont know me and considering you have been dealing with davids family , i can understand your apprehension about vampires .	I assure you that my family is nothing like that .	but
3	151151	I may have given it a go , but they thought i was too young .	I wouldve been allowed field work at .	if
0	130378	I felt the heaviness in his thoughts .	I heard the name of thunderwalker in my mind .	and
0	42070	He 's paired us with twins .	He 's kicking back waiting to see the results .	and
0	17593	You 're the best mommy in the world ? '' .	I love you more than milk and fishbones and ... what else do kitties like .	and
2	28299	I mean , he 's fine . '' .	He 's not fine .	but
4	115770	Your existence presents grim possibilities in the future .	Technology is more advanced and someone just as brilliant as i am , but not as compassionate does what ive done .	when
3	90267	Could cost a packet .	We try for a buy .	if
0	56539	Too few of us realise our .	He paused , glancing at ifferon , true destiny .	and
2	75972	Sinclair broke her hold of him .	Only to strip off his coat , waistcoat , shirt , and undershirt .	but
1	140154	There was no further dialogue .	They were both suddenly sound .	because
2	146044	I want to keep my name here because i want to put some distance between you and me .	Only here , that 's all .	but
3	69138	The only way we can catch james is .	He is the one that raped sarah .	if
2	130168	I could 've sent them back at the guards .	All i did was stop them .	but
0	97489	To brush my teeth .	Throw on some minimal makeup .	and
4	130141	Bobbing his head , steve said i remember he said something like , im going to do to you what i did to that little bitch last night .	Mike found us in dead grove and he started attacking cory .	when
2	14982	I 'd often suspected he took care of his needs during his morning shower .	I 've never been brave enough to venture into the bathroom for confirmation .	but
2	111816	Regina had bought a first-class reservation on the titanic .	Decided to stay in southampton for a few extra weeks and take the next steamer out .	but
4	125046	I stated , recalling the moment of terror in the pit of my stomach .	He had me crammed in the door jam .	when
3	124180	It would be nice . '' .	He took a break once in a while .	if
0	34957	Where the dagger might be hidden .	How they could go about pinpointing its exact location .	and
2	80878	The need flooded back in the wake of all that reprieve .	Hunger actually gained the upper hand , at least for the moment .	but
0	113070	The explosives were set .	We were just waiting for the scattered teams to push ignite .	and
0	150618	That is my sister .	We speak on the telephone almost every day , i could almost hear the smile in her voice no spy cameras , i promise .	and
2	88230	I can tell the soldiers are more than uneasy to let us leave .	None of them say anything more .	but
0	31177	Where they pulled out bags of flour and sugar and corn meal , ripping them open .	Lapping up the contents .	and
3	106595	I would definitely see it .	I turned to mist .	if
2	120443	He tried to walk .	It was moving through molasses instead of air .	but
0	86268	She lifted her head , there has to be a communication in the meantime .	Looked at him , `` but you 're .	and
4	30862	Things quieted down guests either going out to sit on the front porch or going back to their rooms .	The social hour was .	when
0	41646	He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal .	He thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little money with him .	and
2	129106	At least she told her body to move .	All that happened was a small flop of her torso , as if she were a fish out of water , and her head started spinning .	but
1	80440	If they bought a monument here in ada , they would have bought it from joe gifford .	He 's the only monument works .	because
3	27975	But , hell be severely disappointed .	The trip gets cancelled .	if
2	16937	As he stood there debating his next move , two figures emerged from the smaller doorway and squatting down quickly , tom watched them pass directly in front of him .	Their eyes appeared to be set straight ahead , so he went unnoticed .	but
2	8135	He was arm 's length from angie .	The woman stumbled backward , shrinking against the broken car .	but
2	125165	This is just educated guesswork on my part .	It seems like the scientist who mutated the weaving manipulated it to work only on females doc offered .	but
0	94233	Do not attempt to climb the highest tree on the island , do not hack off the arm of your enemy and wear it as your own , have already been officiated .	Do not run into granite walls .	and
0	15845	The mob is going to miss him .	His jolly urging to wholesale troll slaughter .	and
4	75013	Those people down there will just have to worship my memory .	I go at the end of august .	when
2	95459	I stood , a little shaky .	I knew i could walk .	but
1	115835	When she gave them .	They 'd gone out of style .	because
4	41816	She found not a small degree of satisfaction .	The man had to help cassandra .	when
1	67722	And of course reese pembleton just happens to work in that exact garage .	It 's how it goes .	because
2	20346	I wish i could 've blamed my tears on the hormones .	I knew i could n't . .	but
0	144327	Carved by the abrupt change in the streams direction .	What he saw in it made him exclaim .	and
3	55967	Maybe that 's what it would take to get him to back down .	The hurt on his face was as real as it looked .	if
2	151288	Shed bought her a new dress .	Carolyn was determined to show off her new duke sweatshirt .	but
1	62677	He was able to keep her prisoner for so long . '' .	So many carpathians swore he was teaching them a class in safeguards when the murder and kidnapping took place .	because
3	90104	`` , then he should have been expecting the fall-the others were falling in the muck , '' cordus complained to a red hand captain .	Your man was as experienced as you say .	if
4	91285	I will return . '' .	You are ready to choose a new don .	when
3	16076	Nothing would ever be normal .	I continued to allow her to disrupt my calm .	if
0	144923	They do not feed it when it has hatched .	Only try and chain it .	and
4	30504	I never knew such men existed .	I met your father .	when
0	149912	But gatlin had changed .	That was harder to understand .	and
3	66130	`` what you have done ? '' .	It had been your eye .	if
0	29122	Errol ran up vimes 's back in a flurry of claws .	Fastened himself firmly on his shoulder .	and
0	147786	She just opened her eyes even wider .	Raised her hands in a hopeless , i-have-no-earthly-idea gesture .	and
0	62563	Zook roared in anger .	He turned the painful power onto the bubble that bound him .	and
3	151403	I will ruin you and rip you to shreds-and then some . '' .	You have sex with kyle or any other man for that matter .	if
0	127093	Let 's try it , '' she murmured .	Held out her hands to skyler and ivory .	and
1	38533	My life is not defined by my attractiveness .	That brings its own perils as well as its own rewards .	because
0	26543	He 's frivolous self-important , but . '' .	He 's my brother .	and
0	140971	I ran in my thin-soled sneakers my feet ached .	I longed for the well-padded running shoes that would become popular in the future .	and
4	104066	What would have been the future ( what still might be , if evanna 's plan failed .	Mr tiny had sent harkat and me .	when
0	6237	My body remembered faster than my mind .	Moved of its own accord as he dipped and twirled me about the floor .	and
1	67184	We 're called afterlights .	We give off a faint glow-which makes it easy to see things in the dark .	because
0	82358	`` the old priest raised his hand as if he would strike her .	She laughed in his face. .	and
3	9521	`` what i actually said was i wondered . '' .	I kicked a puppy if it would whine more than he did .	if
2	14783	He smiled at her , `` perhaps . '' .	I know i was glad it was you here tonight and not cora .	but
2	6912	His handsome face was impassive .	She had the impression he was pleased .	but
4	132857	Us to resort to a turkey baster .	I 'm perfectly capable of taking care of the job myself .	when
0	77381	Then , with a crack that resounded through her brain , her head hit the far wall .	She fell heavily to the dirt floor .	and
2	63528	I was trying to make light .	I was bummed out about a bunch of things .	but
2	130718	When she returned andrew had woken up connor .	The two were obviously groggy .	but
0	137182	Chance offered his hand .	I hesitated only a second before i took it .	and
3	18155	She would have sensed .	Someone had been inside while she was .	if
3	40505	But it was so damned good to be home .	Even this was just a short stay .	if
4	89703	Such brutalities did take place .	Kidnapped children needed to be made ready for begging .	when
3	74718	He wasnt happy with the idea of giving the chief the entire story he still wasnt sure .	He could trust the chief in spite of how dianne might feel about it .	if
2	81841	Know i have lied so many times about the bruises i have gotten .	Jayden is the one who gave them to me .	but
0	142458	The words written on the window seemed to be smoking .	For a moment i was confused by what i saw .	and
0	150908	He closes his eyes .	Pulls , grateful for the solid shape of this known sensation .	and
2	82709	Dani turned in surprise .	There was no body to go with the voice that had spoken .	but
2	63136	Maybe it was because she was still seething about her encounter with spencer .	Her body reacted before her mind could intervene .	but
3	128152	We will die here on this field .	You do not listen .	if
2	47565	Some other survivors had joined them .	They were battered and beaten .	but
3	114414	Just put sean and me in a small room together and watch the kilowatts go through the roof .	There was ever another power crisis .	if
2	138481	My mom went to work .	Shes almost returning and i dont want her to know that i was gone , marina explained as she cleaned the grass from her clothes .	but
0	139047	Jerzy and joaquim shook their heads .	Jerzy gave me a surprisingly serious look , for him .	and
0	76435	It had not escaped his notice that junichiro had made extraordinary progress in his study of english : he had seen the boy make persistent overtures to the russian artillery-officers , in particular , and questioning any he found who could speak at least a little french .	Had furthermore devoted himself with great attention to mastering not only aerial tactics , but learning as much as he could of all others .	and
0	39405	So you did , '' he returned .	There was a pleased edge to the words .	and
2	156002	With which he disagreed .	Felt powerless to influence .	but
3	159265	You 'll peg me for a bravo .	I tell you i 'm tough .	if
2	44031	She 'd considered taking a shower in the locker room at school : tina et al .	That might even be more dangerous .	but
0	112736	They were attempting to circle around .	Get in front of them .	and
3	21670	Ill still love you .	Even you do lose all your hair and your stomach begins to bulge to shirt popping proportions .	if
4	44827	Aiding the sensation by moving around while beating empty logs with a stick and chanting deep nonsensical phrases , he made the arrest at daybreak .	His quarry bolted to escape the ghostly menace .	when
2	98186	`` sir , forgive me for calling at this hour , '' kresh said , `` .	I have some very bad news .	but
4	121010	We feel like genuine rock and roll stars .	The town hall comes into sight with a number of people outside the venue .	when
3	25326	Who would have been pounded into jelly .	Theyd tried to inflict such punishment on another human .	if
2	107479	He 'd heard anything .	Just got his answering service .	but
2	85604	Some of it was like psychobabble .	Some of it seemed quite powerful .	but
0	76854	She 'd be his queen .	Then he could stop `` dicking around '' up here with her .	and
4	41535	Vadim was going to address her .	She finally shook her head slightly , which seemed to mean , no .	when
2	105691	It 's just not marked out .	There 's a slight discoloration .	but
2	126706	Rand jumped forward , reaching for her .	He was too late .	but
2	69153	I opened my eyes , expecting to see smith .	Found only brown eyes above me .	but
3	78867	They 'll be able to deal with any frictions that might have arisen during the past year .	The three arendish dukes meet every summer .	if
0	27671	Rusl answered the call to arms for the gamelon front , she reveals , grabbing a shocked expression from link .	Took talo with him .	and
2	79313	Her senses whirled , as if she might faint .	She did n't . .	but
2	70563	He had always been a predator .	Now he was sitting easily at the top of the proverbial food chain , a predator without competition .	but
0	124844	I finished my coffee .	Poured myself another cup .	and
0	129599	But his mouth was dry .	His throat seemed to be strangely constricted .	and
0	40739	As she obeyed him , he pulled down his zipper .	Moved her dress out of the way .	and
2	154454	Which made it a darn sight harder .	Helped to make up his mind .	but
2	102467	I followed as quickly as i could .	The branches and vines whipped my face and caught on my feet .	but
3	138785	He was doing too good of a job hiding it .	Winston had been planning to kill or torture them .	if
1	132772	Then i ran over to the chapel .	I knew she would give me permission to leave the grounds under the circumstances .	because
2	47597	I was not having anything to give them at that time .	Tears in those quiet eyes were forcing me to help them .	but
2	84648	The two men might have been on different levels .	Things had changed since .	but
3	140525	She 'll be retired and find a good home in the interstellar history museum on new terra .	She ever becomes less than starworthy .	if
0	120194	Chloe has gage tucked under the gazebo .	She 's yapping into him , spastic like a wind up chihuahua .	and
2	111320	There was a muffled explosion somewhere inside fluffy , and that sort of thing happens every day .	He was lifted about three feet into the air .	but
4	144397	I 'm not leaving my socks . '' .	We 're in bed .	when
2	97550	`` he will bring a rose for you , '' her father promised her .	A rose was no good , a rose could not keep her safe .	but
3	122801	One tremendous shove and the armoured man would be floundering in the water .	They came round the lake to his side .	if
2	142406	She looks cute . '' .	Her bite is lethal .	but
3	4431	They would have been decapitated .	Anybody had been near him .	if
2	22347	He asked silbra dal for more details .	As expected , she respectfully declined to answer .	but
2	110140	He didnt need to polish it , as its gold surface had remained unblemished .	Out of some strange sense that this was a precious item to him , he did .	but
2	3363	I felt something shift then settle , the soft spot was still there , still vulnerable .	Now i showed it to him , i closed the door on it , locked it and handed luke the key .	but
2	123533	He was no longer material or matter .	Something lose and free and flying in the air above everything .	but
3	145639	Why would you dis a rock star , ? '' .	You want to be one .	if
0	93357	The girl went over to the lake , crunching back and forth across the pebbly shore , and talking to the eel-like fish that swirled in the depths of it .	Waded her bare feet into it .	and
2	112581	It was summer and , this one with light blues and hints of yellow against a background of cream .	Today was going to be hot so he 'd lost the t-shirt and was just wearing a lightweight plaid shirt .	but
0	43339	He can become any creature he wants .	Even turn a rose thorn into a dagger .	and
4	59647	That kandrigi came to this ka a long time .	We ware both young .	when
2	154708	Summer 's weight was warm in jenny 's arms , and .	Summer 's flesh looked like real flesh , not like plastic or that hideous goo that slug 's body had been wearing .	but
0	141470	After i fixed things with the financial office , i hung up .	Tried to figure out what i should do next .	and
4	135090	The two men backed away , letting ty '' s knees go weak .	Dolce pulled it out .	when
0	64676	The taller man jumped to his feet .	Found himself facing his enemy .	and
2	147732	The baxters and aunt abby and even agent townsend had told me the facts .	Only my mom could make me believe them .	but
2	49494	My name is william t. grayson .	You can call me will .	but
2	88667	Well , it would probably be smarter to just stay here . '' .	I understand the need to show you 're not giving your life up .	but
4	82830	She was in the rosewood day parking lot again , mona 's car barreling toward her .	She shut her eyes .	when
2	119758	I should be relieved .	I realize i am .	but
2	75425	I shouted , lunging .	A cadaverous hand stopped me .	but
0	110448	Girard licked a drop of blood from his lips .	Then grinned at her .	and
0	144496	He 'd used it to power up the circle .	I could feel its energy trapping all the magic in it , including my own .	and
2	16786	Tamar started to say something .	Was interrupted by jabril .	but
2	56293	I do want you immobilized , and . '' .	If i give you the cure , you 'll just go right back to being a pain in my ass .	but
4	58730	The sun was painfully bright .	He stumbled out into the streets of natayos and went looking for the source of the screams that had awakened him .	when
2	96552	If one of us relapsed , it could affect the other .	Since andi 's issue was not really alcohol or drug related , she was hopeful that we could help and encourage one another .	but
3	118963	The second question is would you still want to marry him .	He is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today .	if
2	53298	He was a senior , got suspended a lot .	Always seemed able to find her .	but
0	62378	Isabella sat down on the ground .	Started to unfold some small rocks into paper as she had done at the beginning of the maze .	and
0	19748	The guy pulled a gun .	Ran off down the hall and down the stairs with the security boys in hot pursuit .	and
0	66789	Leech forgotten , joyah .	Addri jumped forward to the edge of the crevice .	and
4	62784	Heat skittered up the length of his arm to reverberate through his chest .	She slid her palm against his .	when
2	93668	She started to bend and touch him . '' .	He screamed again , and galen was suddenly at her side , taking her wrist and saying `` make sure he sees you and not her before you touch him .	but
3	135109	Wasnt any sacrifice worth the cost .	It meant saving those i loved .	if
3	77476	At least he would do so in comfort .	He had to spend the daylight hours sleeping the sleep of the undead .	if
0	88566	She was human , she was vampire .	She could not escape the call of passion and of joining , flesh-to-flesh .	and
0	66558	Opal tightened her grip on eva 's arm then shoved her .	Dragged the girl over to where clementine was standing .	and
4	103889	He tipped everyone , handing extra dollar bills to everyone he encountered ; and then he decided that he was being taken advantage of , that perhaps they were even laughing at him , and he stopped tipping .	He first arrived , scared of being seen as a cheap arab .	when
2	57132	No child needs to hear that his mom left because she chose to be with her lover .	We 're not little kids .	but
0	129538	Then those sounds began to fade .	All she heard were the deep breaths of mira .	and
2	149789	She reached out a hand to touch his chest .	He took a step .	but
2	157403	`` i am finishing an ma in microbiology , and . '' .	Have just been accepted to the john hopkins medical school .	but
1	13690	Her father convinced to buy her a horse-no pony for her .	She 's a real cowgirl .	because
0	25283	Fearghus dodged an iron spear to the face .	Blocked a sword to the gut .	and
2	70003	Not just his eyes were no longer red-rimmed because his stature had altered .	She hardly recognized him now , and .	but
0	91516	He kicked the horse .	Rode off towards noiknaer .	and
0	36946	Frowning , he glanced at the number .	Waved his fingers at the door .	and
2	135804	Yes , but only her chocolate-coated side , i wanted to say .	Then i realized what that remark of his meant , and all at once , i really was terribly jealous of charlotte .	but
0	72267	She peered into a new room .	Saw a horde of men waiting for her in various states of undress with evil grins stretching across their collective faces .	and
2	68641	Somewhere in the back of her hazy mind , she knew she was dreaming this unabashedly sexual fantasy .	It was too delicious to force herself to consciousness .	but
3	138966	You slept during the day .	You would be too you were completely helpless .	if
4	138981	Particularly delighted in telling the others about her sordid encounters with the others .	Particularly it involved her time with foreigners .	when
3	63117	It should have been through them by .	The boat was heading out to the jetties .	if
0	35977	The security here seemed very heavy-but , then , the church is in the west bank .	There had been a couple of terrorist scares .	and
0	158612	Armed with this important intelligence .	Despite the cold and rainy weather , urrea managed a forced march in the middle of the night on february 25 .	and
0	158122	I walked over to the edge of the pit , bent .	Held out my hand .	and
2	43008	He wanted to laugh .	Sound carried too easily in the wilderness .	but
0	29480	How he 's rehearsing his lines for my mom about how sorry he is .	He 'll never do it .	and
2	106383	It would remind me too much of what happened .	All i was thinking about the entire time was kayden .	but
4	67074	His stories took arkadin to places beyond moscow .	Mischa smuggled him out past the inner ring of smokestacks , past the outer ring of high-security prisons .	when
0	104942	When she was settled with a cup of coffee in her hands , he broke the eggs .	Began beating them into a frothy brew .	and
4	124983	They go from exuberant to timid , then a girl recognizes me .	The kids notice me at the back of the room .	when
0	88867	There 's more room . '' .	You 'll be comfortable in your own bed .	and
3	122671	Then why in the hell would she let him hold her like that .	We were meant to be .	if
4	120262	He left an open invitation for colton to come join him .	Reece moved to new york city right after graduation .	when
4	7911	The dam at the head of the first cataract whose completion in 1912 he emulated in a scale model across one of the many furrows on the argenti estate .	He was still in hios .	when
4	142813	To give him sex .	I can barely look at him without throwing up .	when
4	33660	He threw the revolver down with such force that it bounced off the table and went rattling away on the floor .	Parkman reached the city marshal 's table .	when
0	9292	It took a couple of minutes .	It felt like the chopper was doing too much lurching around , but marcone eventually nodded .	and
0	10409	His father mustve passed the rulings to allow for this change in the seat of power .	Kept his own council on the matter .	and
4	54769	She used her cell phone to call her assistant .	They got back to where her gun was buried .	when
3	6831	... `` very nice , gideon , '' a rich female voice applauded from the center of the room .	Anything had happened to her .	if
3	14176	After a few monotonous days on the schooner , mal and i asked tamar .	She would show us some zemeni combat techniques .	if
2	92520	Sunglasses almost made him look cool .	The freckles ruined it .	but
0	133123	I am going to head back to the nivag family .	We will go to the landing site .	and
0	49641	Paris 's face suddenly morphed into strider 's .	It was strider who slammed into that lithe little body , in and out , over and over .	and
3	132978	Theres still the birthday curse hanging over us .	Even they didnt have a few peculiar habits .	if
2	150895	He got his share of kisses in his role as host .	They werent the same .	but
0	63445	Adri was compelled to sit .	He lowered himself to the stone surround of the fountain , shuddering .	and
0	55477	Other than that her mother liked the sound of the word .	Granny weatherwax kept a careful watch on her she failed to spot any signs of magic .	and
0	126056	Slade , like his father , was tall over six feet of lean muscle with the reddish hair and pale skin typical of saxenburg .	Normally very well built .	and
1	138014	They were hazy , impossible to see except in vague outline .	There was always that puzzling blue filter between , the blue filter that was sometimes cut by those yellow markings like tiger stripes .	because
2	103219	Sometimes we lost our way .	We always found our way .	but
4	24116	It was nearly two years .	For the first time , we finally had time alone in a hotel .	when
4	13129	I laughed politely , because that 's what you do , right .	She turned back and winked at me .	when
2	135715	There was only a single dim bulb .	It was enough to see the spiral notebook .	but
0	60144	Catcher sat down at his desk , then rubbed his hands over his face .	Kicked up his feet .	and
0	86174	He climbed a short set of stairs .	Crouched while scientists connected his suits rods to internal connecting points .	and
2	143224	Bertie had known , did the police listen to the likes of roberta frasier .	Had heard jacko 's plans .	but
0	123565	Alyssa nodded anxiously at gabe .	Gave the waitress a shy glance .	and
1	134378	It was a kelpie .	Hed grown up hearing all the highland tales from his sisters .	because
0	88918	He clasped both hands around her delicate foot .	Directed warmth into each cell .	and
2	65952	She read , she wrote .	Mostly , she leaned back and thought about the next adventure in her life .	but
0	103076	We hear too many rumors .	Believe them without foundation .	and
0	83366	Xcor took three leaping steps , his weight sailing upward and landing him upon the lesser 's back just before the slayer hit the apex of the fencing .	Pitched his body into the air .	and
4	157240	They must 've hatched .	The body began to cool and they 're devouring our cadaver .	when
0	142854	My stomach clenches for some reason .	I step back , still locking my hand on the door though .	and
4	112998	We had stopped at this fort two years .	Our supplies ran out before we could anchor in delogao bay farther .	when
2	85994	He 's dressed in just his black boxer shorts i got a peek at earlier and his body still has the ability to make my jaw unhinge .	I 'm more prepared for it this time .	but
2	16395	He was not big for his age .	It was still startling .	but
0	7260	It was wonderfully debauched erotic and .	Affected her all the way to her soul .	and
2	124596	Meant to sound understanding .	It came out like i was bragging .	but
2	51424	He is waiting for me to say something .	What can i tell him .	but
2	31072	Ice tried to soften his expression .	It still looked like a cross between a scowl and a glower .	but
0	38919	I guess it must still be term time .	I suppose it is quite a lot of money to spend wandering round a hole in the ground .	and
1	36820	He should be allowed to help .	He 'd claimed , as cadence 's friend .	because
2	49159	He wants to laugh .	Can not make a sound into this liquid .	but
2	146736	I wish i 'd known sooner that you were coming . '' .	It 's too late to cancel the trip .	but
3	19896	Then you have to drink it .	I can get my whiskey into your shot glass before the minute is .	if
3	123510	How are we to know ? '' .	Grainna is on to us .	if
4	120302	Who 'd broken it .	She glanced up and saw her reflection in the glass of the cottage window .	when
3	46527	Gray then bring them .	You 'd feel easier taking the other twelve .	if
2	53250	They played through the song .	Had little claim of extraordinariness apart from the fact that their singer was a girl .	but
2	137169	He glanced from declan to jess and .	Then gave a shrug .	but
0	83360	The stream will take me to the river .	The river will take me home .	and
2	15125	I had ridden in among the whole gang of them .	With the lights out there was no way they could tell that i had joined them so i was still safe , at least for a matter of time .	but
3	21374	`` , how did the astrids get through ? '' .	Nafia is standing guard .	if
4	1453	Chapter 16 the following morning , mary newlyn was waiting at her front door .	Rose , gia and susan arrived .	when
2	78166	No , this is the first time i 've eaten at the parallel . '' .	I 've heard the food is wonderful .	but
2	23932	Surprise flashed in her eyes .	She stood and lifted her robe .	but
0	46279	He sipped his drink .	Let claire take in the club .	and
0	53185	He 's arrived safely at hawk headquarters with shadow and ... '' before he could finish his sentence , i whirled round .	Stared at the phone in horror .	and
2	33623	I know hes afraid to share them with me .	Ive heard him talking about it .	but
0	99894	I placed the fork in it .	Gently closed her fingers over it .	and
0	142810	The girls skidded to a stop at the porchs splinter-riddled mouth , but their stand at the edge was stolen when a great vacuum powered on and pulled them in .	Launched their vines to catch the girl .	and
0	44634	Once i just wanted to follow someone 's orders .	Do what i was told ; that way i could live with the illusion that everything was going to be just fine , because someone other than me was in charge .	and
4	114811	But i believed him .	He said that he didnt kill .	when
0	83738	To take the sexual initiation .	Become members of his personal fan club .	and
3	59420	Our culture would have got contaminated .	We had remained a part of india .	if
4	118757	Now , if she could just prop her head against something ... she woke up .	The van came to a stop and the dome light came on .	when
0	157378	He pulled a business card out of his shirt pocket .	Handed it to her .	and
0	22854	Desperate , she unwound the thong from her hand rolled .	Planted her outside foot .	and
0	155186	One task complete , he took a flashlight from one of the drawers ; unceremoniously dumping its paper contents onto the floor .	Went down into the hold to retrieve the yellow waterproof pelican case from one of the shelves .	and
4	121927	What happens next summer , after graduation .	He 's really gone .	when
2	84750	She begged ! '' .	He only laughed and said , `` she might 've taught you how to use it , mannish girl .	but
1	34508	The only reason i didnt tell you is .	I wanted to keep you safe .	because
1	126370	He felt no guilt at all for lying by implication that nothing was going to happen .	He knew something was going to happen and he knew exactly what that was going to be because he was going to be doing it .	because
4	150307	He added , `` your face .	I stared at him .	when
0	15552	Cassie and scarlett each bought a skewer .	Struggled to not talk with their mouths full as they walked the festival 's perimeter .	and
0	71958	In spite of these great efforts , nothing was found in the ground .	The staff showed nothing hidden below the holes either .	and
0	71344	I 'd gone to the kitchen to get something to drink .	Found devin and grace .	and
2	79740	We would love to stay and talk , we must get going .	Now im sorry captain .	but
0	75343	Before he could make any progress , the dampening field quickly strengthened .	Prevented him from deepening the connection to her mind .	and
0	103874	Too slippery audrey revealed .	Glanced at me with an impish expression .	and
2	159428	You think that you know what is .	Forcing us to move will kill a part of what we are .	but
0	66141	It kept me awake and angry .	In a way it was bad , because it was draining my energy and my will .	and
1	124651	I 'm in hollis .	I have a fellowship gig i have to fulfill .	because
2	38849	I can make it .	Yeah , i 'll try .	but
0	158565	She reluctantly pried herself from him .	Hurriedly crossed the garage to her backpack .	and
2	140408	They were making an effort to keep their voices low .	The bus was too small for real privacy .	but
4	19718	This disgust for how he spent his free time was always a breath .	Speaking to his parents .	when
4	46643	Who brought about the separation between irene adler and the late king of bohemia .	Your cousin heinrich was the imperial envoy .	when
1	117438	I think the goodbye was harder on him but he 's not used to losing people who walk away ; and that 's what i was doing .	He 's used to losing people who die .	because
0	92444	In a moment of inspiration he turned over the bed .	Discovered pine slats nailed to supports .	and
4	81366	She thought he seemed far away , as if he had traveled back in time .	He opened his eyes to look at her .	when
2	78286	He 'd already showered once that morning .	He thought it was time for another .	but
0	127298	Matthias shuffled to his feet went to the dead guy 's ankles .	Hooked his cane over his shoulder .	and
3	123462	To meet the day .	Even he had no idea who or where he was .	if
4	56463	I had only made it to the parking lot .	I needed to stop to try and catch my breath .	when
2	156168	I 'd like to talk more .	You 'll have to pardon me .	but
2	86916	I mean , i heard it was . '' .	I never understood it .	but
2	58475	His brother would be at the office .	He knew the call would go through .	but
4	57639	I 've only had a tree twice . '' .	I was with foster families .	when
2	53958	The apartment still mostly looked like we 'd just moved in , even though i 'd lived there going on three years , and .	Raegan more than one .	but
0	41718	Who stared at her with wide eyes .	Kept trying to choke out something behind her gag .	and
4	49310	Who could charm the birds from the trees .	It suited his purpose .	when
0	116111	My court shall be in my castle , and .	I invite all of you to come there and help forge the constitution and the rules by which we 'll live .	and
2	100477	There is a light , and .	It 's getting stronger .	but
4	65750	Ivemixed it with your tea on occasion .	You are a bit too , uh , you poison me .	when
3	94200	He would think her too clingy .	She told him and then pull away from her .	if
0	5072	Translating , coursa , jain , airk .	Eduard sat around the table to hear his findings .	and
4	8708	He looked at her .	He kissed her at the football game .	when
0	98390	I 'd never seen anything like this before .	This was my third time on post-apocalyptic i-95 .	and
3	34109	Theo had decided on a course of action hoping to attract attention to his party .	Only to distinguish himself from his father .	if
3	59128	Then finish what i came here for .	So you decide to trust me i can be an asset .	if
2	114265	Under her breath she couldnt help .	Say , oh my god .	but
0	6232	When the rabbits were almost done .	Their bodies were dripping clear juice instead of blood .	and
3	160510	We have to follow her trail .	We 're going to find the answers .	if
0	99380	Briony took a quick shower , before hurrying back to the kitchen to pull out the biscuits before they burned .	Dressed in the soft cotton pants and tank top she liked to sleep in .	and
0	115412	The sky was overcast .	The landscape had all but disappeared in darkness .	and
4	158381	The snow which patient old winter laid upon the mountains inch by inch will disappear overnight .	She breathes upon it .	when
0	41140	They were being herded .	The dragons ' chirping calls were growing more energetic .	and
0	97433	Edgebriar 's chokehold loosened just the tiniest bit , trying to be calm .	I sucked in a much-needed breath .	and
3	44070	There might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house .	I could find the former owner .	if
2	14276	There must have been close to one thousand buttons .	None of them had been labelled , which made it impossible to know which one would de-activate the autopilot function .	but
2	18255	I 'll twist arms until they break .	They 'll be confirmed .	but
1	114137	She was so warm .	She was pressed against gabriels naked chest , his strong arms wrapped protectively around her .	because
0	47474	The hawk is yours .	You see him , you know him , and feel him .	and
0	47636	Catalina jumped to her feet , trying to help him to balance .	Put her arms around him .	and
0	129623	We should leave the wars to the mortals ! '' .	Let them destroy one another .	and
0	57589	Looked at the place from above .	Dubbed it the glass menagerie .	and
4	118890	Ned asked , how often will we drop by .	They were back in the squad .	when
4	138606	How fierce callie is .	She 's set her mind to something .	when
2	20247	Witnessed not by friends or family .	By hundreds of vampires i 'd never met before .	but
4	44122	His face was grave .	Doctor abaddon saw sam .	when
3	92642	The curious thing was .	The breakfast table jury was anything to go by , that denying stories like this only proved that they were true .	if
0	113612	His name was moshe .	He worked this same shift almost every day .	and
3	50680	I would appreciate it .	They point to me as a horned demon .	if
1	6947	Maybe subconsciously i felt safe in letting myself feel something for them . '' .	I knew i never had a chance with them .	because
0	126276	There were only fourteen of the hobgoblins standing .	Some of those were bleeding .	and
2	86571	It must have been pretty at one point .	Now it made the place look dated .	but
0	79091	As she called out her husband 's name , beth jerked upright off the pillows .	For a moment , she had no idea where she was .	and
3	87583	They could go on from there .	He felt the same way .	if
2	119786	They spoiled me , i admit it .	I never let it go to my head .	but

2	158044	I cant imagine the place you come from .	It has some strange ideas .	but
0	115657	Miss lu placed the shiny disc in the groove .	Again pressed the button .	and
3	50484	You have an extremely creative imagination and you use very elaborate props .	What you tell me is a lie .	if
2	146317	Her voice emerged as a soft , seductive purr .	The order was unmistakable .	but
2	136397	Boog keeps an eye on him for us . '' .	That 's about all we can do .	but
2	156100	Kids made fun of it when i was younger .	Stopped around high school .	but
0	149650	They came to rescue me but i got .	All of them got caught .	and
2	144103	I am sure these are all loyal canadians .	It never hurts to check .	but
3	49989	The whole house would be .	He kept this up .	if
0	113304	She 'd tipped him well that morning .	She was very glad she had .	and
4	11187	He was told but diverted his eyes from the creature .	He reached its body .	when
4	53713	I pulled out my phone and dialed my mom .	I got to my room .	when
0	125164	I would keep it casual .	Not say anything much , just in case it was a joke .	and
3	127075	Then there would be sharks , eating the fish , right .	They had fish that would snack on jenks .	if
2	136380	He wouldnt normally think of two weeks as a long wait .	He didnt know if hed be able to resist her until the sale of the inn went through .	but
4	123833	They could not find the child .	They got to the home .	when
2	84019	They just sit there .	Liz got out and joined the small crowd wandering about the base of the tree .	but
0	138417	Gunda grinned at the pirate .	Then climbed back down to the albatross .	and
0	142816	He pulled up to the hangar at the edge of the runway , and after greeting his flight trainer , they moved to the small cessna 172 prop plane to undertake their pre-flight checklist .	Got out of his rental car .	and
3	87968	Well be able to help .	Maybe we know why he is so angry .	if
3	35421	Not being alone made him feel better and drove away some small measure of his gloom .	Even it did turn out to be adolin .	if

3	92944	And , she is sadly mistaken . '' .	She thinks she is too big to be spanked .	if
2	91452	I had always liked him .	It never really occurred to me to like him , like him .	but
3	92392	`` i would 've never agreed .	I 'd known she was pregnant .	if
2	96322	The lurcher opened his mouth to bite .	Ernest was there , and buried his golf club in its head .	but
2	156102	He would never deliberately show it .	I suspected he was furious with me .	but
4	150106	If julie couldnt see their homecomings , at least she could look to a moment .	Their suffering would cease .	when
0	119582	He instinctively thrust out his hands .	Engulfed himself , leah and her father in a bubble of fire .	and
4	41432	Chapter 10 i was a short distance from the volkswagen .	I saw a shadowy figure taking up space in the driver 's seat .	when
2	83594	There is nothing wrong with any of these assumptions .	That 's what they are .	but
4	86791	At the auto-flyer parked outside then left .	The waitress set a menu in front of both of them .	when
4	93420	The halls were empty .	I peeked out from the examination room .	when
2	155504	It is better to avoid carrying placards with provocative political messages .	If you must , try to keep them to a modest and discrete size .	but
0	54568	So katerina had set a bunch of undead goons on him in retribution .	Caused a riot that destroyed half of the lone horse .	and
2	15292	He was being casual .	John could see the muscle twitching in his brother 's jaw .	but

3	146374	I didnt tell him on purpose .	I said anything at all .	if
2	16824	There 's an outhouse .	It 's not in great shape , so i usually go to the bathroom at this truck stop east of roscoe .	but
0	59959	That came from the mine .	Seemed to permeate every part of the city .	and
0	51551	Kosai gave a quick , frustrated sigh .	Then smiled to reassure the boy .	and
2	30157	She 'd chosen her path .	Even she battled against the tears that threatened to break free at the sight of that book and the memories it elicited .	but
0	4318	The novel was originally and deliberately written with multiple versions .	Gratibulash has presented intriguing evidence that it was originally and deliberately written with parts left out .	and
3	3564	It would look like the seminars caleb had been attending had successfully brainwashed him into submission .	He could get caleb to turn him in to the authorities .	if
2	73484	Sure , their immediate future was stable .	Who knew what next month or next year would bring .	but
0	91987	When i was within reaching distance , he clasped onto my shoulders .	Spun me around so that i faced the girls .	and
4	97604	He grabbed my jaw in his hands .	Becky and i were starting to walk home .	when
2	49333	I had to make his prison more compact .	Knew of no magic word or spell that could help me .	but
3	28308	We had to keep it in darkness you can guess how bad things were behind the scenes .	The shop was so ugly .	if

0	112293	Rachel noticed his street grammar had softened .	His former aggressiveness was buried .	and
4	38640	You ever go skating .	You were a kid .	when
0	98377	Brennan grabbed the other by the arm .	Whirled him face-first against the cell 's barred door .	and
2	101922	A memory stir in his mind .	He could recall it the ground began to shake .	but
2	125507	The minions were cranking away on it .	Had not seen walker .	but
4	93164	Which he 'd sell .	The market would give him a huge profit .	when
2	90310	Logic told him that she had also recognized smythe 's hands .	His jealousy blinded him to that fact .	but
3	119782	Id sometimes wondered and by what criteria .	The books were sorted .	if

0	83970	But she is going to the market at wall .	That is too close to the world on the other side of the wall .	and
4	101952	Still , it would be nice , she thought .	She got a moment : someone to go to galleries with on the weekends .	when
2	155497	Someone was at the far end .	They let themselves in their room and then there was no one .	but
4	72875	The loud ringing fills my car .	I pull out onto the highway and hit dial on my phone .	when
4	98085	They were in the middle of the living room in mara 's house in the hollywood hills .	She opened her eyes .	when
3	151814	They will surely kill her , knowing she is not the true princess .	They find yaris here and afterwards get to esmeralda before we do .	if
3	112869	I will chain you to my bed .	You ever threaten to be with another male .	if
3	51446	Will it be alright .	I go up and have a quick look at mandys room .	if
2	57188	The lines trembled with impatience .	Still the signal was not given .	but
2	3551	She was no closer to believing in rohms god or any other tall tales or superstitions .	Some things were better yet unsaid .	but
3	93415	You looked hot getting arrested .	It makes you feel .	if
0	107831	To pull the damn thing off him .	Drop it over the side .	and
0	37204	If necessary , i 'll command her presence . ' .	I 'll send kalten and ulath to deliver the command and make sure that she obeys .	and
3	56083	How empty life could be .	You were all alone in this big old house with no one running through the halls or calling your name .	if
2	20453	Amanda and abigail both snorted in disbelief .	Mary beth 's lips lifted in a little smile .	but
0	153739	He kicked the throne .	Nolen leaned forward , silencing him .	and
3	68438	Wonder , but karen points at a blanket and tells me to get down .	It would be a good time to change into my bowling outfit .	if
0	136348	We must celebrate : we must feast all together , and give special thanks to inti . '' .	We must do you honor .	and
3	28817	It would be perfect .	Only it were at a better time .	if

3	148087	The benevolent etc. , etc. , would reward them .	They re-conquered cromwell town for avallonia .	if
2	155548	It would have been so easy just to reach out and stab at one with his claws .	There was no need for now his hunger had been satisfied .	but
0	69531	He shot a glance at her .	She looked like he 'd hung the moon .	and
0	117457	So shufti goes . '' .	Pours the kettle on it .	and
0	50106	It was quite obvious , if i put into account the overall political situation that jothar is facing the current condition of the royal family , its really not that hard to deduce , if i was in ayahnda sultans shoes , abang ali would be my obvious solution .	Well , ayahnda , it took me a while , but .	and
2	65626	In the drill , the advance started .	They moved up the field , the first two lines started wavering .	but
2	122340	Each of the men had been born about fifty years ago , just as grahame coats had .	Had died in their first year of life .	but
2	5445	Logan smiled a little .	We could both hear how hollow my words really were .	but
0	64829	Saeros , entering late , was angered , believing that turin had done this in pride with intent to affront him ; and , but was welcomed as one worthy to sit among them .	His anger was not lessened to find that turin was not rebuked by those that sat .	and
3	118198	He needs to draw the circle just before the victim arrives .	The summoner wants to properly signal his creature .	if
0	46018	Lucien will not hear you .	Any mortal that happens to rush to your rescue will be swiftly put to death .	and
2	112331	I know . '' .	I have to ask you something .	but
2	52941	Me too , and i would have started sooner .	Now i must rest a little to run the better .	but
4	68743	It 's , and he had his accident .	I was dating your uncle ty .	when
2	18348	The lakeside wolf probably wanted to feed like the rest of the others .	Simon , at least , recognized monty and lorenzo as more than meat , so it was safer to stay close to him .	but
4	72152	Kulingile asked with great anxiety , `` now may i have something ? '' .	The bell was rung for the half-hour .	when
2	36262	Ash opened his mouth to say something .	The unicorns mouth was lowering to hers , stopping before it touched her and drawing out the essence she had offered .	but
1	32267	Whose chest rose and fell .	It was animated by clockwork .	because
1	85620	She was really sad that she had to sell it .	She wanted it to be a place where she could go and feel close to her family every summer .	because
4	99976	'' i 'd gotten more than i ever wanted to know from renee .	It came to `` the talk .	when
3	32618	Then so will i .	He 's going to lie .	if
3	70374	But , then thats when we usually do something .	It starts a trend .	if
2	62009	My skin seemed paler than normal .	Still held that milky-porcelain-perfection all the women in our circle kept .	but
2	126541	It 's not cheap new .	I can probably find you a used copy .	but
4	91715	I did not even know .	I sailed for that damnable country what the bloody things were .	when
2	74236	I still had it in me .	All those monumental emotions eroded the second my gaze caught hers .	but
2	158732	Yes , i knew .	I couldnt tell you .	but
0	38136	The library 's purpose was to be able to communicate knowledge to a being that had no understanding of the humans ' language ( or , perhaps , to be able to communicate knowledge to a being that had no language of any kind .	There was an interactive theatrical introduction that needed to be viewed repeatedly until the viewer was able to grasp the basic concepts .	and
2	52945	Ye 'll die quicker than he did . '' .	I daresay ye willna think it .	but
2	46496	Who she was with .	Watching him take her was the most erotic thing she 'd ever seen .	but
0	117041	Early on that it would be doomed .	Would break his heart .	and
3	143070	I 've already threatened kevin with the most painful of deaths . '' .	He ever breathes a word of this anyone .	if
3	105872	... `` she clutched tight at his hand .	Anything should happen to me .	if

2	33268	Said 'no , ' but did n't . .	I could have held up my hand and marched off and .	but
2	10232	It was not a far walk to the warehouse .	She could feel her internal processor humming with excitement the whole way .	but
4	10555	The only time she thought about school was in the middle of summer .	She wished it were back in session .	when
3	21756	We 'll have to learn how to walk .	This venom can kill our horses .	if
0	84581	This was worse than the time her family had been caught giving out bibles in turkey .	Had been called in for questioning by the authorities .	and
0	55100	The league soldier sank his hand into bristol 's hair .	Pressed the tip of the blaster to his temple .	and
0	147200	I bundled her up , hoping that i might be able to treat her .	Brought her straight back to this house .	and
0	144067	The tawny-eyed boy held up his hands .	His dark sleeves slipped down , showing the runes inked all over his wrists , the backs of his hands , his palms .	and
0	148376	To bring with us .	Now i was regretting it .	and
0	39335	We 've got several inches of snow already clogging up the streets .	There 's more coming .	and
4	128997	I was the only personification of an emotion that could make his heart go still , making him remember the quiet moments and those days of happiness that we shared .	Everything in his person was in turmoil .	when
0	86459	The floor was so slippery , blocked by al the fal en she gained no ground .	Haidee tried to scramble away , to hide , but .	and
2	93395	I knew it was a potentially fatal move , and our lack of an alternative meant that i had to do everything i could to secure his services .	It seemed like the only way he would agree to our offer .	but
0	45945	One in leeds , one in newcastle and one in liverpool , each would pay him .	Then would deal with their own street dealers .	and
0	107900	Those were the words i 'd been dreading hearing .	They caused my heart to crack , splinter , and disintegrate into black dust , leaving a hollow , cavernous space in my chest , an ache that just pulsed and pulsed and pulsed with pain .	and

2	103270	His partner called him steve .	He said that wasnt his real name .	but
0	96611	They didnt fit in the prince .	They will not understand me .	and
2	42438	It had always been easy to communicate with her .	Perhaps she had been reaching for him as he reached for her .	but
2	61572	He heard the worry in her voice and then looked down at her .	Held her close for a moment .	but
4	43292	Yet , you place so much value on that single tool .	Even you are gifted with the sense of feeling , intuiting and greatest of all , experiencing .	when
0	2331	There is a narrow path beyond it .	It goes straight up the mountain .	and
4	159152	How funny rover was .	We made him smoke crack .	when
4	2820	But , his good intentions were blasted into a million pieces .	The scent of cassie 's blood hit his nose .	when

0	82639	Peri pointed her wand .	The woodcutter fell to the floor .	and
1	69615	Shade didnt need any weapons .	His are all part of him .	because

4	107362	He nearly fell on his ass .	His boots connected with the slippery ground .	when
0	51939	She shifted back and forth between her feet .	Her fists clutched the fabric of her dress .	and
0	69997	The dandies were so inoffensively foppish .	So entirely inebriated that lord maccon felt comfortable enough taking them up on the offer .	and

2	60208	I 'm not saying that this is the case with lord reinhardt of course , for i hardly know the man .	I do think that it would be wise of you all to avoid being alone with any singular gentleman at any given time .	but
0	60771	Experience had a big influence on him .	Was the main motivation for shay going into politics .	and

2	4217	He meant my indecision would hurt denny .	As his eyes glistened even more , i was sure he was also talking about himself .	but
0	116838	I close the door quietly behind me .	Sprint down the corridor .	and
3	6443	We 're just the crew to handle it .	He needs straightening out .	if
0	71642	He huffed , stopping time , pleading with her , pacing , yelling denials and demands , before finally nodding again , because she refused to back down .	Puffed for half an hour .	and
3	93517	I wondered ... ... before i could process all of the tangled emotions overtaking my system , fiona cleared her throat to speak .	What gunnar had said could be true .	if
2	136723	The elves and the faeries was one thing .	Seeing angels up close took his breath .	but

2	130161	Truth teller obediently turned to leave ? '' .	His master called behind him , `` have you seen aught to frighten you today .	but
3	78058	It was a breeze to turn down half .	I could resist full-on tempting .	if
2	116551	As i was telling them , we did .	They had joined with a larger force .	but
3	154672	Her heart bumping harder and harder as they approached .	She could have broken free she would have run toward it .	if
4	30001	The time will come .	I can see him again and we can go back to our life together in our nice house in our nice neighborhood .	when
0	43998	That he used for a mirror out of its pocket in his belt .	Propped it up on a rock .	and
0	72092	He drew a beer .	Set it on her tray .	and
0	47373	If they were just outside the door , then a safer bet might be calling the police .	Waiting for help to arrive .	and
0	74481	Thamet and serak reached around their back ; the smell of fuel stung his nostrils .	Showed him one torch each .	and
3	91754	It will mean nothing .	She thinks the rules apply only on the track .	if
1	119691	Cooking with ellery was fun .	Neither one of us were very good at it .	because
2	73043	Who came in to get marked up .	Tonight the bright ideas of cutie-pies annoyed him .	but
0	131385	We were both lifted again on poles , as we had been .	Hurriedly carried out of the great hall , leaving the court behind us .	and
3	82424	What , she dumps travis , and then it causes problems with mare and me .	Abby 's not fine with it .	if
0	126112	A freighter came in yesterday .	All sorts of unsavory characters have been frequenting the bars and shops around .	and
4	78727	Then put me off .	He saw i 'd a cake in the oven-when i joked him about it .	when
2	39423	Savoring the taste of her .	Keeping a rigid hold on his control .	but
3	9263	He 's a bare-faced liar .	Fela says they were .	if
2	452	She held on to the blade , he thought , and .	More importantly , she stopped talking .	but
3	35292	I could deal with flying solo in the housing situation .	Maybe i 'd at least had a boyfriend to cozy up on my daybed with me .	if
3	20191	But i 'm wondering .	This is a time to request rg backup .	if
2	49276	I was still mad .	I knew it would be a long time before i saw him .	but
2	71668	As he was just about to leave orbit , he noticed what looked like another ship on the radar .	It soon disappeared so he thought nothing of it .	but
2	93955	This is dirty pool .	I 'm not trying to suppress how much i want him .	but
2	127682	They had a reprieve .	It was a very short one .	but
1	46472	Tough decisions are called tough .	They 're not easy .	because
0	76566	She glanced from borden to jazz and back , dark eyes glittering ? '' .	Said , `` reached any conclusions .	and
2	74861	My eyes flash to his .	I dont see anything dark .	but
2	42203	He had no money left , so there wasnt much chance of finding a room to let .	He saw the mans point .	but
2	94242	It could have been rotting bodies and toxic rising-damp emanating from the buildings bowels .	Was more likely to be the bins piled outside the entrance .	but
4	94417	How such methods were fallible .	One wants to extract reason from religious dogmas .	when
2	16386	The colonel immediately changed his demeanor .	Instead of becoming more furious , he turned genial .	but
0	156175	Now therefore the valar were gathered upon almaren , fearing no evil because of the light of illuin they did not perceive the shadow in the north that was cast from afar by melkor .	He was grown dark as the night of the void .	and
0	96657	She turned her horse north , straight into the teeth of the storm .	Rode from view , following the fence .	and
2	18332	Cries mairead to no avail .	Lifting her hands to ward off the rain of blows .	but
0	87170	She brought the sword in front of her , fully upright .	Held it with both hands .	and
1	9952	It was a real shame .	The country itself was gorgeous and the people outside of baldurs boardroom were friendly and welcoming .	because
4	26003	Winnie was so thrilled .	She heard what i received .	when
2	16126	His face was still serious .	His lips tugged into a wry smile .	but
2	32274	He imagined the faces of all those men at the dance who had tried to win her .	She would have none of them .	but
1	156798	They vowed to savor the next ten hours .	Their ordeal was just beginning .	because
2	133865	He 'd been nothing .	Kind to me and i 'd blown him off .	but
0	55081	I was just getting my nightgown out from the drawer .	I knocked a picture down behind my dresser .	and
0	146860	He picked up the glasses .	Handed them to me .	and
0	143779	He fiddled with a retractable bayonet to be installed on all of the rifles .	Was fine tuning the design .	and
0	135280	He was the tantric .	He seemed to be engaged in worship of the goddess .	and
3	105471	Plus , i had no idea .	It was even true .	if
4	62233	He glanced at her in the rearview mirror .	She was settled in the .	when
2	64017	He tried to slam the door .	Lucien 's foot was in the way .	but
0	143338	She might as well take what she could out of life , doing her best to ignore him .	Enjoy herself along the way .	and
4	152608	We got kicked out of our apartment .	We ran out of belongings to sell .	when
1	113705	Then go right out and buy a high-dollar trench to wear with jeans and a t-shirt .	He 'd be able to wear it at work when he got home .	because
0	122067	Oison raised the sword .	Drove it down into the place graham had been shot .	and
3	97024	To pay my dues .	Even that means removing staples from a two-hundred page appraisal .	if
2	4955	He 'd come out ahead in their first encounter .	Damned he 'd do it .	but
1	135066	Especially all i had were me , and i certainly wouldnt drink my life .	Alcohol is no substitute for anything .	because
4	32986	One would sense the tenuous nature of existence .	Descrying a frog flattened onto the pavement from the force and impetus that drives money and human behavior .	when
2	19265	It was humiliating , yes .	The touch had also been pleasurable .	but
3	39552	He 'd see me .	I got within a quarter-mile of him .	if
0	152316	They 're warlocks , you know .	They were meant to be figuring out how it could be done .	and
2	111599	I dont know the proper word for it .	I do know that inside is some kind of machine that keeps the lampposts working .	but
3	143314	Tony would have acknowledged the conundrum .	Youd been able to ask him .	if
0	96332	I am the lawful lord of riverrun .	... '' `` not so long as edmure tully lives , '' said lady genna .	and
0	67379	Aleesha reached in her pack .	Took out some tava bread .	and
0	48370	His gaze was unfocused .	He could barely raise the lids .	and
0	202	To take care of business at home .	I 'd had a few adventures with frey and his boys .	and
2	158027	It wouldnt be so bad if there were an actual karaoke machine , you know with the poor synth versions of popular hits and the crappy ball bouncing lyrics .	No , that was too expensive for big mick .	but
3	153859	At least and let me go .	I 'll never mean anything to you .	if
2	64985	Christiana looked around to see if anyone was watching them .	Everyone entering seemed intent on their errands , and those leaving were engaged in groups of their own .	but
0	147201	My eyes set to casting .	That were when i saw him .	and
2	93793	Everything had been going .	As the wedding approached , tim became more distant .	but
3	22888	They 're as patient as stones .	You give them something formal to watch .	if
2	117573	You 've been receiving threatening letters , which i assume are in the folder you keep using as a weapon . '' .	I 'm not sure how i can be of any help with that .	but
0	11199	Phyllis for her part would continue to remain very quiet almost the entire summer .	She took a subservient back step to larry whenever he was .	and
0	29234	Glowed soaked him in a blood red shroud .	Shining from her eyes .	and
4	110163	Should they leave their families to make a petition .	They fear their loved ones will starve during the weeks it will take to bring food from the king 's store house if they are successful .	when
0	65368	Then he opened the door .	Closed it behind him .	and
4	134207	Who groaned out whats with hitting me with pain .	I just answered your question .	when
4	37205	To continue to be a clueless pain in the ass .	It comes to you .	when
4	113818	Shame fills my heart .	I think of the guys i used to prove that i 'm not like mom .	when
0	49756	Then cara squeezed her hand .	Moved back to give the paramedics room as they maneuvered their gurney into the small room .	and
3	44819	To write down the words .	I thought i 'd forget 'em .	if
4	113831	I 'm not joking .	I say after seeing him stake vampires that he scares me .	when
3	102997	She wondered to herself .	It had really happened at all .	if
2	12698	They had all been willing to buy their properties at a reduced price because of its close proximity , but after some sweet talking and a cuppa , and then another , and another , everything was fine - and george blissfully continued making the noise .	Now they didnt want it to reflect in the the selling price .	but
0	158503	Yet , despite the kingdoms of man and their best efforts , their artisan legacy lives on .	Threatens to outlast their oppressors .	and
4	67093	Judging by the heads turning in his wake .	He could have any of these more sophisticated women .	when
2	137149	The man her father had once said should have been his biggest ally .	Who 'd become his bitterest enemy .	but
2	135533	I did know alexander wanted us to be .	I wanted to make sure he also wanted me to be a vampire - his vampire .	but
3	103393	We 'll not get the girls free .	Even king james sends us enough men to trample the wolf .	if
4	129259	They were adding the final touches of makeup to my eyes and lips .	Leanansidhe sauntered back into the room , looking so smug and relaxed that her skin glowed .	when
2	157926	Hurstgrove 's seduction had been slow , controlled .	She 'd felt his hunger seething under thin restraint .	but
1	54268	That was probably reflected right back at him .	Her stomach flipped once again and her skin felt as if it were on fire .	because
0	15930	Who was throw out of the colony with me during the gathering .	She just happens to be able to see the future .	and
2	5199	He enjoyed kevans sense of humour .	Sometimes it came out at the worst possible times .	but
2	59561	I tried to jine up with the federates .	They wouldnt have me .	but
2	19308	Anger fueled him as he dodged around overturned vehicles and wreckage , seeking whatever shelter he could .	The line of russian soldiers moved determinedly behind him .	but
2	16157	His eyes twinkle with a smile .	He grabs my wrist .	but
2	37045	Not only gotten involved in a slip of the tongue .	Then reappeared a second time to blot it out of his memory .	but
0	121636	She was a disgrace to the house of fire .	Now she proved us right , the lying , thieving freak .	and
0	62248	I just have time to towel .	Slip into a robe before my prep team bursts into the bathroom .	and
3	61470	It 'll be very hard . '' .	Leroy does n't make it , it .	if
4	93502	Sand combined with flip-flops was a nightmare .	Especially the sand whipped up and smacked her on the butt under her sundress .	when
1	136984	Most mothers were home .	The cost of day care was prohibitive.. dads worked . .	because
0	80581	They swerved in front of me .	Got out of the truck to threaten me .	and
4	31666	I 'm not leaving without sylas .	It all comes down to it .	when
0	60697	Wrapping her arms around him , she smiled .	Her eyes fluttered closed .	and
2	100748	The outfit itself was something any of the girls at school would wear .	No one else would pair it with shin-high tan furry boots , that looked like the needed to be brushed on a daily basis , two wrists full of sparkly silver bangles , bright feather earrings and a hoop nose ring .	but
4	31839	Loki leaned against one of the columns that decorated the dais , and ares tapped his fingers on the hilt of the sword sheathed at his hip .	The trio of entities finished talking .	when
2	135625	The engine noise rattled the pane of glass and grass clippings fluttered in the air .	The man remained stoic , staring .	but
0	131812	Taking one last deep breath , he let it out .	Then he did what he had been doing for as long as he could remember .	and
0	156119	The cottage was gone , the jump rope was gone , the desks were back in place .	We were all sitting in them as if we had never left .	and
2	46844	I wanted to wrap the cord around my waist .	Greydusk held the other end .	but
2	14198	I had heard about noah 's father , and now , now he was .	Had never met him .	but
1	95870	I cried out in ecstasy at the sensation .	It was so sensitive .	because
4	61491	How she could be so tired .	She 'd been asleep for months .	when
2	140611	`` on the other hand , i may be wrong '' - and - `` never mind that .	Losten seemed slightly amused at the other 's sudden loss of shimmer .	but
0	82168	He patted himself down pulled a folded paper free .	Reached under cerise 's hair .	and
4	24203	She 'd done her homework .	She 'd been in middle school and high school .	when
0	100168	The peninsula sloped down to a natural harbor .	Numerous seanchan ships lay at anchor .	and
0	51557	That was soft pure and .	Brought a feeling of heavenly peace to her .	and
4	11284	What made it repulsive .	Barack had bent close yet made her entire body clench in anticipation of darius .	when
3	9495	`` besides , '' said rebecca , `` , we 'll just let them know at dinner . '' .	Anything happens that the gentlemen would be interested in .	if
0	67645	I know he plans to stay at the boathouse another day or two .	He 's got nothing but time on his hands .	and
2	127531	Joe loved his wife .	She still seemed unable to accept that her own country , while undoubtedly beholden to his , was far better off for the transaction .	but
0	72168	Colon flung out his hands .	Grabbed the edge of the roof .	and
2	155488	John stared at the ceiling , and .	Spoke in a low voice .	but
1	91601	He chose trevor to go in his place .	He wanted to spare the boy from the line of questions questions that would have insisted he almost brought death to his father .	because
0	10712	He pulled himself up the slanting deck .	Grabbed for the rail .	and
4	21206	The teacher laughed out loud .	I said : one hundred and four .	when
0	42180	Finwe was filled with great fear , and .	In haste he sent messengers to manwe in valmar .	and
0	60444	She slid down from her saddle .	Sat cross-legged on the grass .	and
0	71253	Releasing the handle , i stepped .	Continued down the hall .	and
0	92695	Then he looked at his government .	Drew in a deep breath .	and
0	119814	We are usually a wild bunch .	Primarily make the enemy focus their attack on us .	and
0	109517	Edie raised an eyebrow .	Asked , why is it so important to finish this project on time .	and
0	158517	The three of them stopped talking started laughing almost hysterically , trying to put their arms around each other .	Looked at each other .	and
2	39574	There was definitely a strong presence of darkness in the girl .	It had not yet gained dominion over her .	but
2	117062	She could see he wasnt telling her something .	She couldnt work out what .	but
0	82485	Instead of going back toward the front of the building they turned headed the other way .	Having made a full circuit of the training area , they reached the main hall again , but .	and
0	77676	He often played with me gave me rides around the rath , grunting like a pig while others laughed or sneered .	Put me up on his broad shoulders .	and
4	40672	And then he 'd chosen hers .	Faced with the choice of her happiness over his own .	when
3	112319	He certainly would have undertaken it .	It were possible for a dragon to blush .	if
0	75568	He decreased his weight dramatically , positioning himself so he landed right in the middle of the alleyway .	Pushed on a window latch as he fell .	and
2	134480	Sure , i worked hard to get into a good college and i have privilege coming out the wazoo .	Paid most of my tuition with scholarships .	but
2	59201	Know i 'm pushing it .	It 's impossible to hold myself .	but
4	11308	Farrah fawcett was one of my role models .	I was a kid .	when
2	30727	He gave no sign that the light of day hurt his eyes .	She could see they were red and streaming .	but
1	143656	He were here or .	I was at home .	because
4	89774	Well , then young lady , you will know what your story is .	Perhaps you have heard our stories .	when
0	36877	As simi came up on his right .	Paused to look into the mirror over his left shoulder .	and
0	151992	She took care of the seer .	Even found time to calm the bird who didnt understand what was going on and that scared her even more .	and
2	112934	We sent out a scouting party .	She had fled into the city of birmingham .	but
0	18120	She had a hand to the back of her head .	I hoped she was okay .	and
0	3008	She heard nathan swearing .	Running across a wooden floor .	and
2	18896	She had hoped to ask a chambermaid for help .	Tim would have to manage the task .	but
3	154322	It would tie her to fablehaven .	She revealed how she knew about patton burgess .	if
3	148073	It would be appropriate .	He simply told the boss what action needed to be taken .	if
3	33218	Not to get blood on this sleeve .	She used this hand to cut her wrist .	if
2	53531	Her voice was calm .	Her eyes , when they slowly lowered to his , were glowing bright .	but
0	36242	In the aegis of my warmth she needed fear nothing of winter .	We raced along the snow .	and
4	21779	He sings a couple lines .	I continue to stare at him .	when
2	144552	I loved sitting around in a towel .	You had to be careful doing that when you lived in a house with a couple of brothers .	but
2	12915	Did a fair amount of mischief in my younger days .	I havent got the vinegar for that .	but
0	103305	Before the votary finished his apothos , nero dug the brocade bag from his pocket .	Tucked a stack of coins into it .	and
2	35280	You can boil water with sound , too . '' .	In this case the generators are designed to induce cavitation fields in a solid .	but
2	96441	Damn , he was ready , in more ways than one .	He also wanted to run .	but
1	59041	She opted for the duty .	She 's never been real keen on entering men 's prisons .	because
2	84999	Instinctively victoria raised her stake .	A strong hand grasped it from behind , holding her wrist aloft , sliding an arm around her waist , and squeezing her so that her breath was caught .	but
2	39056	`` i know that ... '' `` a queen if you agree to be . '' .	You 're a king braith , so many depend upon you , and i 'm .	but
0	106916	To several big scoops of acorn mush .	Poured syrup over it .	and
0	117376	She closed her eyes .	Envisioned her homethe spirit realm that she had brought to life .	and
3	121988	I wonder ? '' .	My rope is up there .	if
0	122821	Her eyes tender , she cupped his cheek .	Rubbed noses with him .	and
3	123623	It would be great , for the book , but right now , we just want facts .	You went back later and listened to the other stuff .	if
0	140102	Without haste she wrapped them .	Then , ere she turned to leave .	and
3	138868	The last thing he needed was competition .	She was one of their own .	if
0	114755	He 'd wanted to know more .	Had learned as much as he could the last several years working at argeneau enterprises .	and
4	147761	That i had already mastered mine .	You were mastering your abilities .	when
1	25143	It must have been a universal signal .	We came as a group to him .	because
2	108256	I am sorry . '' .	I just want to go home .	but
0	121550	A little more than a week and someone is trying to kill you , you almost kill yourself .	I discover that you and i have more in common than i first thought .	and
2	8325	She had tried to leave .	Walther had stopped her .	but
0	121669	Part of the cliff had collapsed in the earthquake of the year before .	The spill of rocks barred the way , pushing the herd through a gap tight against the opposite western walls .	and
3	155804	`` , do it .	You want to discuss current events in the united states .	if
0	35464	Nothing can bother you here . '' .	I 'll watch over you .	and
0	4637	I offer you everything ! '' .	You scorn me as though i were lower than that whore of a lover who left you .	and
0	155475	A second later , he pulled her .	Wrapped his arms around her .	and
0	141919	I followed the womans lead up the steps .	We entered via a pair of gargantuan oak doors .	and
2	154449	His chest was still heaving .	He had recovered his breath .	but
3	24477	We 're still close off the coast of spain .	Best we can do it .	if
4	6129	But , we suspected already that unfortunately your son was sexually assaulted before he was beaten , and this was confirmed .	I checked this morning with the medical examiner .	when
2	119149	Last night he had been worse again , and .	He had died at quarter to eight this morning , only an hour and a half .	but
0	34377	He shoved his hand in the thing 's mouth .	Found the latch that popped open the shell .	and
4	93189	My skin was still splotchy and red , and cam wrapped a giant towel around my body .	I shut off the water .	when
0	99577	These were in truth agents of the crimson king .	When he opened the box , the last thing he 'd see would be a primed sneetch , counting down the last few clicks to red zero .	and
2	40713	He and cynthia had walked out of the theater in peterboro .	He had been too embarrassed after his one attempt to get cynthia to go to the oaken bucket restaurant to stop anywhere else while she was with him .	but
0	65743	Flynn set his mandolin on the altar .	Raised his dagger above his head .	and
2	58825	You didn '' t cut your own rope ? '' .	How could you literally be hanging by your fingertips and still be joking .	but
4	141136	Being nice and letting an abusive ex-boyfriend or abusive ex-spouse back into her home .	He has shown no consistent signs of stopping his abusive ways by seeking appropriate psychological help as such are examples when being nice .	when
3	120870	To have her friend .	Even she hid it under her tough-girl veneer .	if
4	74477	Singing to me , making me laugh .	I land on my feet , he rolls his hips and backs .	when
4	102120	It had been a mistake to bring edric .	She saw the look on his face .	when
4	79142	We both went straight into the master bathroom and undressed for a shower .	We arrived at his apartment .	when
3	116132	They could possibly become allies .	I weaned them off of the influence of the implant devices .	if
0	6070	It 's your birthday , we 're all nice , kind people who wanted to buy you something .	People get gifts on their birthday .	and
4	7359	I 'd just finished the chapter .	The lights went out and the train came to a halt .	when
0	127056	Without speaking , the purple lord and the violet lord turned .	Prepared to leave the great house .	and
4	118303	She had known many of the infected to wake up from the drugged sleep screaming .	She had helped in administering the cure .	when
4	73079	Lord combermere had already been standing in the vicinity of the doorway , eyeing her curiously .	She went inside the house .	when
2	124758	The boy had been in the back room , his bedroom and playroom .	He had tentatively poked forward when he had heard the visitors entering .	but
3	108489	I will only leave .	You 're with me .	if
2	88915	It was his hand .	It looked so much different .	but
4	133340	I pulled off the knitted cap he had covering his head .	We reached the first floor .	when
4	90063	He lowered her feet to the floor and pulled a ring out of his pocket .	He lifted his head and gave her a moment to breathe .	when
3	153131	I am only seeing .	I might hear the fluid moving in the channels which relate to the divine wind .	if
0	150739	Jake ran over to the sink brought it back where he dumped at least a tablespoons worth of salt into it .	Filled one of the hotel cups .	and
1	109493	I went back to my icing .	I did not dare share the truth with anyone outside the court .	because
2	88958	It was good of you too give me a lift home jonas , i am always forgetting my jacket , silly really in the middle of winter '' .	It was actually quite warm when i came in this afternoon .	but
0	154911	The queen had hand-picked those to come with us .	I should have known that the day would be filled with disappointment as the rain would not stop .	and
2	26159	I turned my head as if i was not seeing an image but the real thing through my eyelids .	The face was there whichever way i turned .	but
1	160193	And he only sticks out more .	He doesnt recognize hes at least fifteen years too old for this crowd .	because
4	57365	February 21 one item awaits me in campus mail .	I arrive at the museum .	when
2	154946	She was sweating and sleepy .	A strange thing was happening to the indigestion .	but
3	470	This time it was going to kill her .	She could not react .	if
2	38991	It sounds more like some church named by humans .	I dont think clive was into things like that .	but
0	145784	They emerged onto the deck they fell to their knees , screaming .	Then rolled over onto their backs .	and
3	126072	Where she could hear every disgusting .	They stayed in the living room .	if
4	69923	I should employ a great deal more than average caution .	I spoke to him .	when
2	57883	Georges eyebrows went up a notch .	Again he just listened .	but
4	18232	He flew over it , continued to rise above the treetops , and flew swiftly towards elizabeth , dark , and the source .	He reached the inner fence .	when
3	16709	Phil would happily quote it .	Anyone questioned his actions .	if
2	143971	I 'll come to dinner .	I need a little time .	but
2	47858	I looked around the church , wondering if i could spot brianne .	It was so crowded i wasnt sure .	but
0	74108	In the manner of francis , he stripped off all the luxuriant clothing he wore his fine gold-studded boots .	Gave them his gold walking stick .	and
2	149636	The punishment of lord welk torre was greeted with caution , many expected a much harsher sentence for his failure .	Other understood he largely succeed in the official on the invasion .	but
3	71331	Her mind frantically trying to figure out a way to stop the fire .	It really was a blaze .	if
0	63397	We will do ourselves no good if we continue . '' .	I am getting tired .	and
0	92451	Tarren and collin had been friends for a long time , over the years they had substituted sparring and hunting for eating rich foods and listening to people complain .	Had grown up together in fact .	and
3	36634	Uh , i 'm not stalking around spying on you .	That 's what you 're implying .	if
4	150232	Who had risen - spoke up .	Stefan entered the room .	when
4	96562	But after a long march the enemy camp came into view .	The sun dipped low over the mountains .	when
4	110801	A bit more than mildly heated by his embrace .	He lifted his head and muttered , `` will i ever tire of the taste of you .	when
4	2225	I gasped in surprise .	His weight was suddenly gone from me .	when
2	91415	I was trying my hardest not to be critical .	In truth , i was horrified .	but
0	29345	`` it is a nest of vipers , '' he said , `` . '' .	They have not yet reorganized the command , even though barclay is gone .	and
0	135824	They dropped their weapons .	Moved in the indicated direction .	and
3	125598	How are we supposed to do anything .	We have no money .	if
3	72884	They had no objection / , then climb into the underbay and inspect turbo pumps in the dead of night .	Androv wanted to roll a stair-truck under the fuselage of daedalus .	if
2	68298	He thumbed the edges of the pages .	Did not read anything .	but
2	122209	All of the buildings are derelict .	The location is fantastic .	but
0	78244	We fixed a kind of hammock out of a bit of cloth tied to the two racks , and we had the baby between us .	Hanging from one side of the car to the other .	and
0	90762	Bilbo immediately went to the end of the branch nearest the tree-trunk .	Kept back those that crawled up .	and
3	38386	Rather is 1 or 99.9 .	It happens it 'll happen when it happens .	if
2	20533	The bodies had been discovered in was so sparsely populated he doubted anyone had noticed anything .	Then again , it was a small town .	but
0	93201	The retired saa thalarr wept .	Fell to his knees on the palace steps .	and
2	94730	He should return the pendant to her .	Decides to keep it .	but
2	149752	Ellin had closed the balcony doors behind her .	Both of us knew i didnt have any real privacy .	but
2	75179	She started to move away from his desk so that he could sit in the chair behind it .	He surprised her by distractedly motioning her to stay .	but
3	86233	I was angry enough to commit the attack-but .	She thought that was possible .	if
2	43799	He asked , which was rude .	He wanted to hear , wanted to know that someone understood the pain he felt , the grief he was trying so hard to control .	but
0	92820	I run out manage to saturate myself by the time i hit the door .	Holding my jacket above my head .	and
3	119540	And there was always a debate ; the drivers from hunan delight absolutely could not grasp the idea that they should ring the buzzer for upstairs , rather than downstairs .	We had chinese food delivered after nine o'clock at night .	if
3	122438	Would they someday be able to redefine their relationship .	He gave baxter a chance to sort out who he was and what he wanted .	if
3	119259	Ronnie sighed , look guys , theres actually this girl out there i need to meet , and you guys are kinda crampin my style , you know .	There is one this late .	if
4	127634	There were seasons though , when he and his brothers-and frequently kit-spent the entire weekend battling it out on the concrete court below .	That hoop was never idle .	when
2	87917	Inaction man painted a beautiful picture of the future , with garlands galore and all manner of processions .	He kept a close eye out for spectres and other dark forces that might have been released through the crack in the cars windshield .	but
2	52242	David would have to rush around like a madman to get ready .	He 'd do it , of course , because this was his big chance to bring me down .	but
2	154729	The celebration continued around them .	Titus heard none of it with selena in his arms .	but
4	66508	He 'd lost it , but she 'd still been alive .	She 'd left him .	when
2	22028	I felt giddy inside knowing that we were a step closer .	As i looked up at the guys , they had stopped running and were staring into the forest .	but
2	139565	Neither are good ideas .	It could be worse .	but
4	130110	I could see him better from this farther distance .	He had been closer to me .	when
1	108849	The door handle for support .	I 'm veering toward hyperventilation and feel like i 'm going to pass out .	because
0	13274	The carpet fibers were as soft as they appeared , tickling the sensitive areas between her toes .	Caressed her bare feet .	and
4	59526	She forgot all about how she was going to blow him first , how she was going to make him come in her mouth .	Her fingers came around to cup his balls .	when
1	60698	That last bit was a dig at him .	Tom had to be out here in the morning for guard duty on the pallet .	because
2	97694	Sees me doesnt seem to notice until she was almost by the door .	Amy walks by and .	but
0	87959	I 'm nuts and .	You 're ... okay , maybe you 're nuts .	and
3	136857	Maybe she can pop us out far enough to get out of this magnetic pull .	Astermine two has more powerful thrusters .	if
1	152996	I 'm f**king with him .	I know exactly what he 's talking .	because
2	62407	The sound was far from perfect .	I felt a swelling sense of pride anyhow .	but
0	40066	Putting up with all of that .	Dealing with her homesickness and her and the children 's grief .	and
3	37781	What , derek asked .	He already has her .	if
3	70184	The politics was in full ferment .	The examinations were still distant .	if
1	8299	This was a good investment .	A newly renovated house on his incredible property doubled its value .	because
0	121149	They reached a hilltop just at dusk .	Looked out over a valley that absolutely could not have been where it was .	and
2	136966	They had been avoiding each other pretty .	Hell , he was embarrassed .	but
2	131561	There was the expected crowd of nosy off-duty sooties .	There was also ... `` dimity .	but
3	56975	She generally knew about it .	The duke stayed out all night .	if
0	38432	He scooped up plates and silverware .	Went back to the kitchen .	and
4	64839	His intentions slipped from his mind .	Her soft lips parted on a shaky breath .	when
4	11552	What was he doing in this fleabag .	He could check into some fancy hotel .	when
3	54051	It would be better .	You came back in the morning .	if
3	102317	`` , then i will go . '' .	You leave with me .	if
0	99314	She was being rude .	She immediately felt like an idiot .	and
2	10535	The terrain is certainly hilly .	For as far as the eye can see , it 's covered in perfectly straight lines of grape vines .	but
3	100513	The court has sushi , sandwiches , pasta , pizza , and burgers .	He 's after actual food .	if
0	51322	Asks serot to the ninja beneath him , i am of the roleb team .	Get off me you sasquatch .	and
0	157023	He helped me out .	Put an arm around my waist .	and
3	159614	I wondered , if any woman in his nearly four hundred years of existence had rejected the opportunity to service him .	He 'd ever been turned down .	if
1	78402	Yes , keira teased .	You are already ancient .	because
0	28809	Rosa had collected it in a canning jar .	Jorge had packed several soft drinks and a bottle of grape juice hed found in the pantry .	and
2	56795	Expected i might have to do some fast talking .	Their chief response appears to be wonder , not fear , anger , or violence-a more human response .	but
0	157511	`` sorry , '' she said .	Shut the door behind her .	and
0	34287	Then he grabbed his chest as if he were having a massive heart attack .	I kept my hold on his head , even though from my own high , it looked like he had two heads instead of one .	and
2	102980	I 'll possess myst the coveted ... '' .	Details of the memories became more evident each time .	but
2	34031	Sam doubted hed find anyone .	He hadnt gotten this far by being sloppy .	but
0	109864	Just be on your own . '' .	I 'll find you .	and
0	13144	Hed have to own up sooner or later .	It was probably best to do it sooner .	and
0	160733	We could bleed you to a husk . '' .	You would have paid back only a quarter .	and
0	41024	Cleopas came down from the back of the beast .	Walked into the river .	and
2	140741	Of course , the captain was her precious darling , the big brute .	She had loved inanna , and now inanna was beyond reach ; and .	but
2	94570	I put my hand to my face , hoping to touch cool porcelain .	My fingers find only skin .	but
0	88202	Mituraj wrote on the paper .	Offered it to beth .	and
1	68710	To remember where id seen professor winfields face .	Probably id only seen it in black-and-white .	because
2	61609	I knew getting into a strangers car would normally be crazy .	Holt had saved my life , so i figured he wasnt going to kill me .	but
3	18437	It was like a voice made up of quiet and song .	Such a thing can be imagined .	if
1	129893	Maybe some of it was .	Katryn did not have to watch every move she made around paul , but part of it was also because how close the team had become .	because
3	51360	We could be in augusta before they get there . '' .	Norris and i left .	if
2	100227	What he had normally been attracted to , and her hard nipples that had aroused him so last night .	The nightgown he dragged up past her navel and down to her waist revealed those small but plump and perfect breasts that had fit in his hands .	but
0	99939	The bright , shiny silver bell over the front door chimed .	The little girl skipped inside , followed by jo-jo .	and
0	8865	George rolled to his feet , lunged locked his hands on jack 's arm .	Getting inside his brother 's guard .	and
3	138041	What would you say ? '' .	I told you i already knew the outcome .	if
2	102446	She 'd wanted to tell miles so many times .	Intimidation had held her back .	but
2	157025	Alfred was actually smiling .	Hid it away from alonso .	but
2	127504	She looked up to say thank you to mitchell .	His attention was suddenly riveted to the television set .	but
3	125299	He suspected , the others also shared similar guilts .	Their sunken expressions were any indication .	if
3	145139	They can know things about their environment .	You design the agents to have memory .	if
3	22807	Thered be so much to explain .	I took ronni with me .	if
2	41896	She would have to face up to the bullies .	At the moment , she had other things on her mind .	but
0	149804	The lad raised the crossbow to his shoulder vanished into the cellar .	Gave them one last sullen look .	and
0	133191	Give her forty minutes .	She could parallel park the fox way ford in any place you liked .	and
3	102055	-- -- and sat on the couch , propping my feet up on the coffee table , maybe i could forget about all of this for .	There was anything actually on tv .	if
2	69696	She could save eveline , and .	She did so by willingly taking ian to her bed in order to spare your wife .	but
4	116681	The last and final straw was , leaned over the counter , and started flirting .	Alex flashed an award winning smile at her .	when
2	105619	Lifting her hand , she felt the stickiness along her neck .	Her fingers encountered only sores , not the open flesh wounds she knew should be .	but
3	63980	She 'd already be in an adjacent cell .	Lavalle meant to charge her as he threatened to do with tyrone .	if
4	126118	I 'll never be sorry for not giving you my virginity . '' .	Especially it made me realize what kind of guy you really are .	when
1	115160	There 's no going back . '' .	Once it 's out .	because
0	24392	She could panic . '' .	Try to phone the police .	and
0	57482	He seems like the type to assert his dominance . '' .	You always seemed like a person who dislikes being dominated .	and
2	95064	Caught myself , never slowing the movement of my weapon .	I was effectively separated from seth 's protection against my back .	but
3	7796	You 'd see them .	You owned a shop like abanazer 's .	if
0	81469	From just outside the cell , ben duff shuffled his feet .	Wondered how the old man knew he was .	and
2	121146	Yes , he was in pain .	It had been a slap in the face he sorely needed .	but
0	49639	But then he smirks .	Rubs his eyes profusely , shit .	and
0	52178	I lay a blanket down on the ground and grab some chips .	Take a drink of bottled water .	and
4	124121	One vendor was still intently focused on elloriana and the queen dagdron slipped amongst a group of dresses hanging from the stall .	So the other seller moved a couple of feet from the stall to try to entice other passersby to check out the clothes .	when
3	92178	`` all the same , we 'd be most grateful . '' .	You could take us to it .	if
4	87556	He had no goddamned clue what to say .	Her head tipped back to look at him .	when
4	72362	All the teras were outside the perimeter .	The defense grid came up .	when
0	132617	Although it was imperceptible , the two land masses were inching away from one another , and become separate , though smaller continents .	Ultimately would be separated by a new ocean .	and
2	61069	Taking the bread out for the pig . '' .	Then giving it to you .	but
4	70803	No harm befalls her .	You are not with her .	when
2	79263	To keep running toward merlins .	His dodge had forced his hand .	but
0	60572	Jasha closed in their little circle .	Placed his hand on rose 's other shoulder .	and
2	70167	They didnt look dangerous .	Their quietness disturbed him .	but
3	13727	We need to know about it , at .	Bubbles hears from her .	if
0	130793	Grinding on the cobbles .	Exposing a grinning crescent of darkness .	and
0	46685	I rip the goggles from his face , maybe two or three because i 'm so angry that my strength is out of control .	Throw them as far as i can and know they will land at least a mile .	and
2	66616	He wagged his tail .	When she stepped aside to let him in , he circled back to delbert and licked his fingers as he approached .	but
0	118286	He withdrew his metal flask from the holster at his hip .	Then knelt by the fire .	and
2	98421	Yes , i 'm a vampire .	I can assure you that i 'm not dangerous .	but
4	74049	Claire had almost given up .	She 'd heard a familiar high-pitched screech .	when
3	79450	He was too strong for me to stop him .	He decided on that course of action .	if
0	70363	Later we 'll sit .	Talk to the others if it looks like we have to .	and
4	18046	She still hovered above her twin , daring the big bad men to come any closer .	He next saw her .	when
0	37145	They would load the agent onto the ship .	Take their leave of the dealers compound with all possible speed .	and
0	93972	I finished the whiskey .	Poured a second cup , larger than the first .	and
2	25069	Tears streamed down arkadin 's face .	He made no noise .	but
2	66231	Even know what time zone he was in .	He was going to have to go chase tansy .	but
0	122027	To jump in front of him and punishments about to start flying .	Shield him from the curses .	and
4	59670	She had a weakness for brainy guys who spouted jargon .	Especially they looked like roarke .	when
0	80218	It came out little more than a cracked whisper .	I swallowed to ease the dryness .	and
2	52864	Dawn strained her ears to make out the words .	It was too much of a mumble .	but
4	56081	That had flashed through him .	Jackie went under subsided .	when
2	54954	By late afternoon , another outburst of shouting and mania occurred .	It was a brief episode followed by angry shouts and curses .	but
0	107632	He took a deep breath , and the fragrances from the pine trees and wild flowers that surrounded him .	Exhaled slowly , enjoying the feeling of such incredibly clean air .	and
0	118702	They were the survivors from my sandskiff .	They had been brought before the darkling as witnesses .	and
0	34772	Who had carried out the research .	Had been executed for her role in the epidemic .	and
4	125845	To call your uncle .	You got arrested last fall .	when
2	19855	Now for the problem at hand , i dont know who was in the suv .	We picked them up about a mile after we left mission , and theyve been on our tail ever since .	but
3	43969	He would have booked one every weekend .	He could have afforded to fix up the kitchen and hire a staff .	if
1	109376	I was paying more .	Like you , i know when the risk 's too high but he wanted it and in the end it 's still his company .	because
0	50636	A little getting them back out .	Wiped the back of his hand across his forehead .	and
2	8225	Well , maybe we could have after the first time .	Now feelings were involved , at least mine were .	but
0	5768	Then i make my way to the stone table and .	Find myself standing at the head , just like my father would .	and
2	143559	Dorian had known that it was a risk-that the scientist could try to trap or kill him .	He had no choice but to take the risk .	but
0	9395	Finally , he stopped , eyes beaming .	Turned to face me .	and
3	86891	How are we to learn ? ' .	We do not throw out the dogmas of aristotle and galen .	if
2	72682	This cabinet member would rather not have brought attention to such scandal .	The lcj innuendo was , although damaging to the party , not necessarily lethal enough to guarantee her demise on its own .	but
0	11700	It was empty of anyone but bones himself .	Jean-pierre 's eyes flicked around the shop , but .	and
2	46681	That had entered her voice .	He might as well get it all out into the open .	but
2	85426	She yanked open the top drawer .	It was empty , save for a few sheets of paper .	but
3	157146	Mine were probably going insane with the changing colors .	His eyes were mixed with emotion .	if
3	26778	He was not sure .	She shared any of his feelings , so he moved .	if
2	103873	Dick hallorann had told him to stay away from the topiary .	The thought of the hedge animals did not bother him .	but
3	142470	The chambers will remain fully available for re-entry , to live out these fantasies .	You begin excessively consuming this world .	if
0	39126	It was not a broad road .	It had no wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and deeper .	and
2	76588	I dont even think he realizes how stupid he sounds , yet he expects everyone to worship him as a fountain of wisdom .	I could even live with that if hed only work once in a while .	but
4	21035	Waiting for his plane .	It taxied to the hangar .	when
0	11889	Waters bowed her head .	Hurried off in the direction of the kitchen .	and
0	73433	Iona shifted from her beast to her human form .	Let graham help her up .	and
2	136253	Beranabus had a hundred questions he wanted answered .	There was no one to ask .	but
2	69013	He wont make it for thanksgiving .	Hell be here for christmas .	but
3	64622	When one could find no audience .	One was not poe .	if
4	108857	Where a lady named marilyn monroe once stayed .	She was married to a man named arthur miller ( danny got a vague understanding that marilyn and arthur had gotten a divorce not long after they were in the overlook hotel .	when
2	150023	You may not think it when you look at my hideously tar-infected , mutated face .	I was a very important person in my pre-lake life .	but
1	68449	Was plated in gold.i .	It was expensive.her barge .	because
0	118850	In a swift movement , he grabbed a bucket of water from beside her door .	Tossed the contents onto the hall floor before holding it out .	and
2	36432	They must play before the delacortes or .	They will suffer by comparison .	but
3	109202	He was asking . '' .	I was bailing out .	if
4	103353	The driver would take her home .	She finished her day at work .	when
2	87543	I dont know where and when this happened : only the more tranquil of our species ( or any species for that matter ) eat plants : the rest eat each other .	I do know that today this has become the norm .	but
0	41020	The weight inside her chest eased .	She sat up carefully , slipping out from under jace 's arm .	and
4	78537	If the stranger has a mission , indeed , he will go .	He performs the task .	when
0	116109	Found you in a dark place .	There you gave me life .	and
0	159939	Delvecchio jr. had been working homicide for only two weeks .	He 'd already brushed up against a possible suspension for coldcocking a paparazzo who 'd tried to sneak a pic of a victim .	and
4	49124	`` , you 'll do anything to make sure you never get fooled again . '' .	You realize you 've been sleeping with one .	when
4	9559	You 're this great looking guy with those huge muscles and everyone 's always stopping to stare at you .	You walk down the street .	when
2	119049	It reared excitedly under his weight .	He immediately had it under control and wheeled it around to follow his uncle as he rode fast toward the tiber .	but
0	24344	As for his mother 's voice , it was accentless pleasant , and .	He spoke much more like her than like anyone else in his family .	and
4	49656	Multiply gruber 's woes by a quadrillion and you would have the woes of all the people of the twenty-five million worlds of the empire , and how was he , seldon , to work out salvation for all of them .	He was helpless to solve the problem of one single man who had come to him for help .	when
2	23734	I was still angry with him for leaving .	I also knew this might be my last chance to touch him for goddess knew how .	but
3	9384	He might try something stupid .	Hes separated from her .	if
0	7065	She finished her performance , and asked them , `` okay guys .	Smiled gleefully back at them .	and
0	52628	You have championed the sword .	Now chase after the dragon seen in these parts as of late to test the swords ability .	and
2	1631	The sanitary men disinfected the hooses in yon twa streets , and wid ye believe it .	Theyve even cleaned oot the very middens .	but
4	24927	Many sisters rejoice . '' .	They hear this kind of news .	when
4	53364	He found no indications of asphyxiation , no trauma , no clues .	Rexburg cut into bellamys brain .	when
2	97630	The sauce was almost painfully spicy , leaving them both gasping for water to soothe their throats , and they managed second helpings despite the way it burned their mouths .	The lumps of meat were tasty and succulent .	but
3	143131	Usually took my work home with me .	I required more time .	if
2	128715	Washington had been looking severe during the first part of this speech .	The last sentence made greene and morgan hum with approval and wayne nod his little chipmunk head .	but
0	52649	They 'd come running , but there was nothing they could do to extinguish a fire fed by the black .	Witchfire was fed by power .	and
3	39458	It would be something .	We could identify the dogs whose dna was on the envelope and the hair at the crime scene .	if
1	93276	You 've got ta learn to love the falling .	It 's all about falling .	because
2	99793	The rest of the week went a little smoother .	Stefanie kept her distance .	but
2	136059	She started to smile .	Her attention was pulled by someone behind him , and her body stiffened .	but
0	117401	To gloss it over put it on .	Go find my suit of armor .	and
0	16632	Although they were a symbol of power , they were carrion eaters .	It was a good sign that they were .	and
2	62774	I know its not enough to fill you up , big brother .	It might make an appetizer .	but
2	157682	When his hands skimmed up her waist to her breasts , she blocked his way and .	Broke off the kiss .	but
1	81595	Mom had kicked jacob out of the house for the evening .	Just she was afraid hed act like an asshole in front of everyone .	because
1	10063	He remembered that day .	He and carlton had been down in ben lomond all day fishing .	because
2	434	She might have opened her mouth to say something .	The words were never spoken-i drew in a breath , a huge hole was blown into the side of the chateau and human companions were screaming in terror inside the ballroom .	but
0	13081	Ember opened his mouth .	Gave a muffled gurgle which might have been a yes , maam had it not been smothered by particalized terra firma .	and
0	75557	Alexis opened their door .	Went inside , kicking off her sandals .	and
4	71219	I got stuck in an elevator .	Once i was a little kid .	when
1	46035	She didnt finish her sentence .	I grabbed her by the neck .	because
2	144179	She hated the space between them .	She knew why it was necessary .	but
2	118608	Minutes dragged the crowd grew restless .	Grace thought richard looked fed-up .	but
3	21151	Shed be no more than a magical vision hed never be able to hold onto .	She disappeared back into the forest .	if
0	105964	Her body seemed to go wooden .	She appeared lost in the movements .	and
4	106653	Voss alighted from his closed carriage ( a very undashing necessity for daytime transportation ) gloved and cloaked .	He arrived at the relatively small , but very elegant , well-kept woodmore home in mayfair .	when
0	98397	His light touch on her shoulder earned him a growl and a sideways glare .	I caught a glimpse of those hideous eyes for the first time .	and
0	132087	They spoke in low whispers .	They were all saremon .	and
4	33174	She could deny me nothing .	So she smiled at me then patted the bed beside her i assumed she was going to drop the skin veneer and give me lessons in controlling them .	when
2	49476	We hardly know you .	Sometimes you can know a person deeper over a period of days instead of years .	but
0	17884	It was designed for greater things than chess .	Unlocking its secrets i no longer play upon it .	and
2	82209	There were still plenty of details to go over .	He soon became satisfied with their forward progress up to that point .	but
2	73386	I never had a problem with carrie and her crusades .	Listening to natasha sound so alone is heartbreaking .	but
2	7486	Some people would call me a caring friend . '' .	I 'll take what i can get .	but
0	33825	Destiny abandoned her battle with cerberus .	Took flight in pursuit of the sorcerer .	and
2	108741	I knew it was silly of me .	That was how i felt .	but
4	53124	The stunned expression on georges face .	I walked right past his table .	when
2	128828	She could hear something coming from .	It was soft , indiscernible .	but
0	107600	Every building burned , every flag was forgotten .	Every buried skeleton was scorched as the sacred planet accepted its tragic end .	and
0	88892	Rick had traced two of joes hidden emails to an unknown accomplice named big bear .	Both mentioned hed soon clip the eagle .	and
4	51870	Sometimes helen took her to church , but it had been almost a year since they had last gone on christmas eve .	Her dad was out of town or playing golf .	when
0	116202	She went directly to the counter .	Put the picture carefully down in front of bill steiner .	and
2	23787	He wondered now if the sword , too , had come from another man 's hand .	He put that doubt .	but
4	59262	Was holding them up .	I walked back into the kitchen .	when
0	104003	Felix offered me his hand , a peace offering of sorts .	I took it and shook .	and
2	2087	When he 'd been at work he 'd been all business .	When they were together and away from the office he 'd been equally single-minded in his attention to her and his dedication to having fun .	but
2	85730	Why would brad hide the bag of clothes in his own studio .	The dna on the cigarette butt found at the crime scene was the determining factor .	but
4	79297	Of course he would be an ass .	I was trying to be nice .	when
3	131618	You oppose the community .	You dont choose to help the community .	if
2	55504	Briefly she thought about going back upstairs to look for a flashlight .	Felt that she might lose her nerve if she turned .	but
4	104250	I 'd just reached the library steps .	The guy on my left threw his soda at me .	when
2	135493	The orange split reached its apex in the sky .	The leopard made no move to leap to safety .	but
4	100564	The stranger lifted his head .	Charlie and bessie stopped at the table .	when
0	129347	A muffled voice reached them .	The cheerful hale was promptly answered by the unmistakable voice of aspen rivers .	and
0	54318	`` but ... '' i looked up .	Walter bowed his head .	and
0	64470	By the time our men knew what was happening , riders were pouring over the ditch banks .	Galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand .	and
2	72660	E.you can see that science does have answers , and deep ones .	They are rarely final and even more rarely comforting .	but
0	118739	`` sora will know , '' callum said .	That was all the warning i got .	and
2	10771	Brian attempts say something .	He can not manage any words past his muffled lips .	but
3	22873	And it will be the truest loyalty of every man on board to follow me in disarming and binding you till you come to your senses . '' .	Your majesty will not hear reason .	if
2	76281	You can call him anything you want .	In the end , he seems to take great pleasure in torturing and murdering innocent people .	but
2	76288	It was a plain white van .	No one got a license number .	but
2	16159	We may disagree with them in one way or another .	We are as likely to be wrong in our disbelief as they in their belief .	but
0	159864	She was a wildcat and he 's even a little bit like you .	He was into her .	and
4	92656	She smiled warmly at her high school classmate .	Donna arrived with a cup of dark colombian supreme , a small pitcher of light cream and the days menu .	when
2	48809	Maybe you never win .	You can get pretty good .	but
0	25389	Eventually tracking down my preferred set of winter pjs .	Go in search for the bathroom .	and
3	98300	She take measures to protect her hair .	Lillie was determined to drive a convertible .	if
0	80132	They both loved what they were .	Eagerly embraced their heritage .	and
1	10851	You became a priest .	Just the man you married became a priest .	because
0	150754	The huge beast reached out , nearly driving him to his knees .	Affectionately patted ulath on the head .	and
4	51819	She turned back to chase .	He nodded , smiling .	when
2	5890	He froze , and the cup was empty .	Tried to use his coffee to clear his mouth .	but
3	80948	We have to come up with a solid plan .	Were going to do this .	if
4	39685	They were on their feet ready to trade blows .	A waiter walked up to them with a couple of beers .	when
2	2049	I tried to escape many times during the first year .	Always danven hunted me down .	but
2	151455	She gave a laugh .	There was no humor in it .	but
0	91731	`` but verbena told me that you 'd come . '' .	It made me feel much better .	and
3	69992	I 'd lose her .	I kept her under lock and key .	if
0	69294	Five minutes later , the prison door screeched opened .	Linus stepped inside , followed by alexei , professor metis , nickamedes , and coach ajax .	and
0	8091	He yelled in pain , shoving it against her neck .	Dropped her hair to take his knife in his good hand .	and
2	14431	The scenery was beautiful .	The constant up and down was making him dizzy and nauseous .	but
2	92360	I 'll have to ask ian later exactly what he divulged to jake .	Now is not the time .	but
4	115367	I liked it better . '' .	She had to do as she was told .	when
2	57736	`` that was a catalyst .	The tourist industry in this entire region of central oregon is booming .	but
2	138599	I can do something with it .	For the moment we got no audio .	but
3	56018	To get a message back to us .	You did find them .	if
2	58915	The exchange went off without incident , and .	Gwenna found herself holding that tiny scrap of nothing babe in her arms .	but
2	10076	There was colour , in a sense .	It was the kind of colour you 'd get if you could shine a beam of black through a prism .	but
4	125789	Matchra , rafull , and the rest of esephriss roommates were just waking up .	He left the dorms .	when
4	8009	They lay in bed , looking at each other with tired happy eyes .	Their energy had been exhausted .	when
0	47782	There was so much untapped power in the world .	If they hoped to harness it all , then they needed to start off with some sort of advantage .	and
2	48403	We can ask her , though getting real information out of her is quite a thing . '' .	It seems likely to me that she was buried in a shill grave .	but
2	9034	I would have gathered up some help and i was afraid theyd bust the place up getting him outside . '' .	Tossed him in the river .	but
4	29268	Just give me a call . '' .	You make up your mind .	when
2	122048	You can go home .	You have to take it easy .	but
2	63758	I wanted to leave school .	I didnt know where i wanted to go .	but
2	106313	Joe was still silent .	Ted could hear the frustration in his breathing and the irregularity of his footsteps .	but
3	20900	You 've never seen .	They belonged to rachel solando-are the same children in your dreams .	if
2	11250	The measure of a man is not how much he suffers in the test . '' .	How he comes out at the end .	but
4	157217	She moved ahead slightly and turned , general , can we talk privately for a moment .	They got to the office .	when
4	12432	Focused on the sound of her soft pants .	My tongue licked the salt water from her neck .	when
2	95483	Yeah , i want to ditch it , make your own choices song and dance i was raised on .	I 'm stuck with the old free will .	but
4	121033	To breathe through it .	I held up my hand .	when
0	87490	She surrounded him , hot and tight and wet .	It was better than he 'd anticipated .	and
3	105183	What safety would there be in quiet lands , or in the homes of simple men at night .	The dunedain were asleep , or were all gone into the grave .	if
4	36140	I could still see a concert or hit up a club . '' .	My parents have sam .	when
2	14670	The kidnappers could have been after the ransom smacks of retribution .	Them cal in ' mace in with the intent to kil him .	but
2	102321	Her tips were mostly the same .	Her boyfriend adored her as a brunette now that she dyed it from the red ) as well as nodding to adam behind the bar .	but
2	44024	I 'm still alive , that 's true . '' .	My aches and pains grow stronger with every passing year .	but
4	76373	She 'd fallen in love with him ; he embodied everything she 'd ever longed for in life .	They were in the sixth grade .	when
2	49423	Titto sighed in guilt , his soul is being tortured .	He can not give up .	but
0	139489	She grinned , her chin fitting perfectly into her little hand .	Leaned against the desk .	and
0	74213	I will fight , but i can not break the rules .	Be watchful for mathias 's treachery .	and
4	126857	She didnt even know shed been sleeping in his bed .	She was so sick .	when
2	61945	The man was just too much at times , she thought .	He gave her a playful smile that caused her heart to flip .	but
0	9506	Giorgio saw a glint in his eye .	Knew from experience there was more than casual curiosity in the question .	and
3	8484	`` first you can put them to rest .	You ever had any doubts that i 'm your consort .	if
2	116584	It was francesca 's turn to see if she could catch a glimpse of butch .	They seemed to be .	but
4	142591	We had that night .	She asked me why i never looked at her the way i looked at roxie .	when
0	34951	He told the top of her head .	Then he kissed her there .	and
3	153074	And at last he 'd find out .	He 'd paid enough penance for destroying his family .	if
0	130005	Chapter two sean beech gratton , the butcher 's son , has just slaughtered a cow .	Is draining the blood into a bucket for me when i hear the news .	and
2	108105	She wanted him to start that stand .	He always moved himself aside from ever taking action .	but
3	85704	I 'm not sure . ' .	It was a good idea .	if
0	120195	Considering that you trespassed on their territory , their normal procedure would have been to feed until you died . '' .	Then burn your body to prevent you from rising .	and
0	94847	She looked down the rows of pickups and suvs parked in the small lot .	Saw the silver porsche .	and
2	60142	You 're really great and now that we 're done having raunchy sex i need to get back to work .	I 'd love to teach you to cook .	but
3	37212	He had involved the media and put scott in danger .	Even it had been unintentional .	if
2	119714	I would go out tonight , i sang in my head , thinking of this .	I havent got a stitch to wear .	but
2	135707	Gadara 's brows rose at her tone . '' .	He replied calmly , `` to the commissary .	but
3	146585	She should be a much better actress .	She was going to instigate this kind of drama in order to salvage her wounded pride and inflict pain on the one who wounded it .	if
3	101307	Jace grinned , this place has well earned its reputation as the center of learning and wisdom in the civilized world .	This class is any indication .	if
4	112203	Get about half way , jacob what the hell was that .	I hear the voice .	when
2	12625	He pushed me over the balcony , jackie continued .	I was able to hold on until dean helped me back up .	but
0	33270	Humik tasted it , and all said it was good .	Gave them also some pieces .	and
2	97028	I knew they offered to hide my car .	I was still too scared to involve them .	but
1	56557	That made shadow think of jackson pollock .	It was less problematic to think of jackson pollock than to accept the alternative .	because
0	129525	Sailors were busy about their work as he walked up to the bridge .	Captain brine had the helm .	and
3	95491	The more powerful and important fairies have more designs .	They choose to show them .	if
2	38989	Seeda understood what he was saying .	She could not bring herself to throw the forbidden ice .	but
2	17659	What made that resemblance , too , one about which there could scarcely be two opinions , was the mark or cicatrix of a wound in the forehead , which the painter had slightly indented in the portrait .	Which was much more plainly visible on the forehead of sir francis varney .	but
4	53472	I stopped , put my hands on his hard thighs and his hands came to my neck .	I felt his heat .	when
0	1104	Cornered , she backed into janet 's office , putting her hand on her friend 's trembling shoulder to steady herself as much as to comfort the sobbing librarian .	Stood next to the librarian 's chair .	and
2	1996	Pain is etched into the corners of his mouth .	I can tell hes trying not to show it .	but
2	70686	I bounced a little on my bed .	Restrained myself from showing too much enthusiasm .	but
4	143455	Stuart simply looked him in the eye and the human stuttered to stop and backed .	His father came home that afternoon and started to reprimand him for it .	when
2	146156	I take a walk over to the bookstore and other than that its a very quiet afternoon .	Pick up some of the textbooks for this semester .	but
2	2401	`` i 'm going to f**king kill him , '' i promised to no one in particular .	It was one i was going to keep .	but
2	117244	Sean began to move his hand .	Mia grabbed it and spun around to face him before she thought better of it .	but
1	50442	They proceed to make a spectacle of themselves .	Just i said to .	because
2	150130	I should just kill him now and that something screamed no .	Be done with it .	but
0	138227	Found dorian 's gaze on me .	Knew he scrutinized my every reaction .	and
0	20378	You might get hurt , but not like this .	Eventually would have to face your death .	and
0	66851	He did enjoy the occasional liaison with jenny in the cargo hold , but she stayed busy most of the time preparing meals for the captain and crew .	They really couldnt get away with that all the time .	and
0	47044	She needed a better spot a better angle , if she was going to have any hope of taking any of the creatures out with her arrows .	She hesitated for a moment , loathe to leave him , but .	and
3	117235	I 'll ask our doctor if he can order it .	They want to tell me the name of the test they want done .	if
2	70425	I could see him watching me .	Then the crowd swallowed him up .	but
2	123482	Davos had heard that some of the lords of the three sisters had webbed hands and feet .	He had always put that down as just another sailor 's story .	but
2	98735	The inside was just as bad , maybe worst than the outside .	It was cheap and centrally located .	but
2	67837	Just staring at him .	That changed when , all of a sudden , he was gone .	but
0	22295	`` there 's a house there , '' he said .	Pointed to a tilted little structure tucked into the last stubborn stand of pines .	and
0	116398	Clenching the keys in his hand , he inched away from the steps .	Stopped a good six feet from me .	and
1	45944	I had to keep changing my position .	The metal would bend or the concrete would crack and crumble .	because
0	160310	The dainty little beauty was also most intriguing the buxom rosalynd with her big mournful eyes absolutely luscious , but .	It was elena who was full of cleverness and dark disdain for what had befallen us .	and
2	88174	Thinking kept her busy .	A solid plan still eluded her as she showed up to the rubber room once school ended .	but
0	40573	Eshonai unfolded her arms .	Flexed a gauntleted hand .	and
1	9719	I 'd halted my studies .	Only ethan had made me a vampire .	because
4	125911	Theyd gotten even worse .	Norah had shown up .	when
2	110846	She certainly wanted to .	Was nervous about how receptive he 'd be now that she no longer had the element of surprise .	but
2	4368	Later ages would say it was crude .	Then come to love the complexity and ingenuity of it .	but
0	115599	Faye laughed , delighted .	Clapped ralph on the shoulder .	and
3	114518	He had joan - or sister gregory .	She liked - to look after for a bit .	if
3	59180	Is he asking me .	I have a husband .	if
0	86584	The youngest son was not at all serious .	Had about the same talent for horticulture that you would find in a dead starfish .	and
2	115597	In the end i had poobi to stitch me up a hood or mask of fine stuff ; it had two eye-holes and covered the whole helmet .	Such as could not be seen through .	but
4	27843	I came out here and began my phd in psychology at stanford .	Your father entered the cia .	when
3	14347	You stick to that spider and you do not cheat on her .	You are in love with a spider .	if
0	64253	His breathing had calmed since shed seen him sleep last .	The soothing pattern of his chests rise and fall mollified her , though .	and
0	141898	Claire flung open the door .	Had the satisfaction of seeing michael jump .	and
2	133823	Not to let her in , no matter how hard he tried .	No words would come out .	but
4	71956	He growled at her , remembering her assurance that what they did together would be nice .	He let her go .	when
3	124433	She would be beyond pleased .	You and lady grayson would attend .	if
2	157947	I was definitely a mess on the outside .	Inside where my heart still thwacked out a beat , i was absolutely floating around cloud nine .	but
2	23472	The neon glow never truly died .	The suns bright light faded it always seemed to flare to life to dominate the sky .	but
4	134071	He continued , `` i 'll tell you-the worst ten seconds of my life . '' .	She made no reply .	when
2	15938	Even know if she had a television in .	Now wishes he did .	but
4	125848	Keep her babies from harms way .	She couldnt hear them .	when
1	78902	The new shirt was a lot smaller than what i usually wore .	I 'd lost so much weight .	because
0	114264	He leaned his head down to hers .	Nibbled a small path along her hairline .	and
2	93655	Donacora thought she had seen it .	She was baffled by the chaos .	but
3	21471	He had to be insane .	He thought she was getting any better .	if
4	6554	Again , she exclaimed delight .	I lifted the bonnet and showed her doris 's private parts , resplendent in chrome and polished to a high sheen .	when
4	71111	Was reaching for her shoes .	She felt a sudden , sinking sensation in the pit of her stomach .	when
4	86460	He threw in the use of a cart to get the thing to the quayside free of charge .	I mentioned this questionable advertisement , playfully twisting a few left-over bars of iron into decorative shapes .	when
2	123113	He hadnt done anything wrong and still , being arrested and handcuffed was never a good thing .	Would likely be released by midafternoon .	but
3	26324	Mom would kill me .	I let you do that .	if
4	18795	I 'll be glad .	This plague that has taken over our lives finally clears out and things get back to normal around .	when
2	54057	Sometimes she felt like a dirty old woman lusting after such a young man .	He was all she could think of .	but
3	40392	It would be great .	You could give me some of your time to help track down some information .	if
0	82727	Her voice raises two octaves .	Solidifies the fact she still has feelings for me-or that her plans of cheating off my papers have been reduced to nil .	and
2	96199	I didnt really know jaces older brother .	From what id seen of him at christmastime , he was pretty abrasive and intimidating .	but
3	77010	It 'll force him to stop working . '' .	I tell my dad you 're tired .	if
0	149016	To rule the world .	Displace zeus as the king of the gods .	and
0	25727	Taking prisoners of war , brutalizing them until they stopped fighting .	Sentencing them to a lifetime of slavery .	and
2	3973	Part of their mind is thinking , yes , it would be nice to be released from inappropriate desire .	The next time they see a pretty woman , they will dwell on her .	but
4	30948	You can be a right sour cunt .	You put your mind to it , jim murdoch but one that i lap up , and thats a rarity - i can assure you .	when
2	26701	I opened my mouth to thank him .	He beat me to speaking .	but
2	119162	Pickett 's face was blank .	His eyes were sharp and wary .	but
0	5452	They were so at ease .	The warmth of their interaction began to thaw grace 's resolve .	and
2	101614	He had no idea how much the little female required .	Assumed he had taken .	but
0	112690	She ran over , leaned over to her mother and whispered something .	Took the spot that her father had just occupied .	and
2	8268	`` say what you will .	I can see it on your face .	but
0	110496	The jar of elderflower tea is for nerves .	There are several small packs of seeds and berries for the journey .	and
3	44169	He felt bad about forbidding my gig .	He was offering to serve me .	if
4	76191	He could see the other side of the central table .	The final heads parted before him .	when
2	70411	He is the smallest club member .	He has the biggest and friendliest smile .	but
3	27162	And be assured the way is prepared in advance .	I do not survive .	if
2	87204	He lifted his glass to salute her .	Did not take a sip .	but
3	155212	Instead of ordered restaurant dinner , it looked .	Jett had every intention to cook for me .	if
2	9672	I know that i havent always made the right choices in my life .	Things are starting to get back to how they used to be before i messed up .	but
0	10161	Suddenly , he turned .	Made a dash for the edge of the roof .	and
2	94032	I had no doubt i could possibly force the issue in a roundabout way .	I needed her to want it , to want me , to want us .	but
4	29032	I had a huge problem causing my blood pressure to spike and more adrenaline kicked me into high gear .	I opened the garage door to leave the house .	when
2	68968	The tables were set with white linens and crystal table service .	No one but the hostess and two waiters were .	but
2	119885	Messenger was not surprised .	He had hoped but he could also understand .	but
2	79876	He punched the air , then called gordon .	Was sent to voice mail .	but
2	159060	Cole remains in the den .	By the time i come back with drinks , he 's sitting on my bed , also known as the couch .	but
4	9459	That king martin used his knowledge .	Extensively he first took the throne .	when
3	124198	Should you rise during daylight hours .	You will promise not to wander around .	if
3	63429	You 'll keep your trap shut .	You want to keep your front teeth and a pair of fangs .	if
3	83273	I 'll tear my own head .	I have to live in the rover that .	if
4	142945	Her abandoned on sylvia and phillip andrews 's doorstep .	She was an infant .	when
0	29952	There were a couple of them .	My lips parted when i recognized a black and white shot of my little car looking funny out there against the expensive estates .	and
0	7479	Lord cornwell looked over his shoulder as she scrambled .	As she fell , he looked back at her only to find her on the ground .	and
2	27169	Anyway , it 's a long story .	The short version is that you should never piss off a stevens ' .	but
2	78133	`` the sea provides all the salt that qarth requires .	I would gladly take as many olives as you cared to sell me .	but
2	73775	The habit of military discipline certainly played a part .	Worry about indigestion was the decisive factor .	but
2	87009	Students started to rise again , ready to fight .	The president ordered calm .	but
2	139418	This house had been one of five gramma owned .	She 'd sold them and was currently living on the income .	but
4	39778	The last contact was .	He advised that he was passing over ibijay , sir .	when
3	136317	You 'd be the same .	You 'd spent your life in this cursed wood .	if
2	147953	I could read his face .	Stopped when i spotted his mother watching us .	but
0	69392	I grabbed another thick slice of bread , piling on more butter and cheese .	Repeated the hedonistic act .	and
0	39010	My head slowly turned to him .	I saw his paint dissolving down his body as the rain beat into him .	and
4	95797	`` , somewhere that conversation i mentioned that once upon a time , years ago , i had a crush on you .	Becca called and told me about your journal .	when
0	76536	Gingerly stretching their muscles .	Inspecting their surroundings with a mixture of curiosity and distaste .	and
2	61408	Us to have some little bees of our own .	It is not to be , so be it i guess .	but
2	49095	All the other men had been tall enough to waken them by jogging a foot .	This little fellow was not that tall .	but
2	53701	`` that 's my problem , not yours , and .	Yours is much more pressing .	but
3	31511	We would once again see the return of the purges and persecutions .	Half of his colleagues in the council had a similar opinion .	if
4	49525	Her reveries were interrupted .	A slim man with a crop of light-blond hair and a cherubic expression entered the cabin .	when
1	160623	Actually , i dont know what they planned to do with me i rambled , a character trait tristan was accustomed to .	It would have taken a lot more of them to kill me than that .	because
0	48444	When the dainties of old broke through from underneath .	Started the new city .	and
4	137024	Having her go all vampire on me was the last thing i expected . '' .	I asked her to tell me what she was hiding .	when
4	33396	Sudden vivid ashbacks to the mental jungle gym arriane had taken her .	They 'd rst met .	when
0	21431	Shifted to get a look .	Was astonished to see nothing but a silhouette where a person should be .	and
0	75637	I saw the look in your eyes .	I wished to spend my last night on earth with someone who understands my pain .	and
2	32936	Was that she had gone missing the day before patty hearst was captured and no-one knew what had become of her .	Her face rang a bell .	but
0	153778	Riding back to the front of the pack .	Motioning miserere to take his place at my side .	and
2	23062	The cut is deep clean now , and .	Colin swears he saw a hint of bone .	but
2	76932	Biggs seemed to be in his early twenties .	Would have died from it within a month .	but
4	89795	For those moments , she was very much in the spotlight .	She popped out of the cake .	when
0	113602	That i 'm a celestra .	She was probably going to drain me of my lifeblood one day .	and
4	98518	He remembered both technology and profits were in bad shape but the work environment was great .	He had joined media .	when
0	88558	Chris could take the work with mr. kinsley .	I could help you with the mercantile , mr. moyor .	and
2	142754	She tried to pry them .	Rage must have made dm even stronger .	but
3	110530	Dylan could still have a future , a chance to turn his life around while he was still young . '' .	I confessed to driving the car .	if
2	3527	I was not sure that i was imagining this all or this was really happened .	Through our brief studies the tree was becoming a part of our everyday life whether we were aware of it or .	but
0	57715	Numerous large cuts soaked his dark green uniform .	He had been beheaded .	and
0	91420	The man stood briefly .	Sat back down cross-legged on top of the well at the center of his tent .	and
2	131154	What is big and strong like an ox .	What is a bit slow in the head .	but
3	158994	`` , we grab him .	We find out who the accomplice is .	if
0	71396	The second breathing was mary-lou .	Somebody was holding a knife at her throat .	and
0	128818	He held them out to her .	After a moments hesitation , claire took them .	and
1	104623	A failed job is worse than eating nine cinnamon raisin maple horseradish bagels .	When you work in my field , a failed job is like a failed date with a billionaire .	because
0	82255	She could not stop thinking of devon .	Could not stop her mind from wandering and dreaming .	and
0	45349	The wood resounded loudly in the darkness .	While it vibrated in my hand , the bone held .	and
2	78768	Nicholas was a fool .	At least he has proven to be a useful one , he said .	but
0	151409	When klaus showed up unexpected .	Caught my father tweaking a few wires on becks arms .	and
2	155177	I had no idea how i could get back to the roosevelt without being more suspicious than i already was .	I had to trust joe knew what he was doing .	but
1	22950	She even hears me .	She 's already saying something to trina .	because
2	78146	He had to run , run for his life .	It was all open , nowhere to go .	but
4	128040	You would have thought she 'd just died and gone to heaven from the dreamy look on her face .	He looked at her .	when
2	19066	Wealthier merchants of distinct lineage could afford to purchase storefronts , the best of which were in the north district .	The entire market was ringed by first and second generation shops .	but
4	1703	To keep out of hugh priest 's way .	He was crossing the street .	when
4	135638	Her eyes glowed from dark green to bright jade .	I was inside of her .	when
1	34571	I can not sense death around you , old man .	You do not die .	because
4	80315	A few weeks his mother had been murdered .	His parents had taken them to six flags .	when
0	118269	Miranda had loaned della her new jeans skirt .	It looked really good on her , especially paired with the spaghetti-strap top with art deco black-and-red print with flared tiers of fabric hanging down the front .	and
3	143860	After all i 'm sure she would terrify me .	Ele scares my dad .	if
2	124732	She had told her about marco .	Alexa had assumed , as most people would , that it was a just a fling .	but
2	151689	A servant would be killed on the spot , easily recognized as one of doombas creatures .	Humans , however , could not perceive deception and betrayal among their own kind so easilyuntil it was too late .	but
0	129819	Slender stone bridges arched between some of the towers .	She nearly took her head off on one of them , concealed as it was in smoke and shadow .	and
3	13646	He certainly just got it .	He wanted my interest .	if
0	85567	She had freed the shackles of her mind .	Did the right thing .	and
2	39182	To back up doris remarked , i find that rather interesting .	Move on to a different topic .	but
2	110912	I 'll take him back to texas . '' .	He 'll be a flight away if something else comes up , director .	but
0	48225	I never knew holden before when he was actually himself .	Now ethan is back in his right body , i still see holden .	and
2	125967	I let the idea roll around in my brain .	While it does not seem foreign to me , it does not resonate either .	but
1	136219	And even that would be hot .	It would be penny .	because
2	130397	Walter lunged after the dogs trying to catch them .	He slipped on the straw , nearly fell and cursed .	but
0	140481	Trent shouted as he stood .	Those around him quieted .	and
2	36788	You 've mentioned it in passing .	No one ever has just come right out and explained why you believe it is a possibility .	but
0	104846	What he would take .	What must be left .	and
2	25830	Garion and aunt pol held their shield of thought in place .	The searching touches of the grolims came mare .	but
0	69788	`` listen to me ... '' liz raised her voice .	Reached out to make him face her .	and
3	157706	How long his favor will last .	You persist in your current way of thinking i do not know .	if
3	26591	Then i will worry less in your absence .	You promise me that you will not engage the augs if you see them , or do anything else heroic .	if
0	132904	This is too complicated to explain .	We need to get to nolan .	and
0	74870	Raiden frowned down at her .	Crossed his arms over his chest .	and
4	600	Do you know ? '' .	That 's going to happen .	when
0	80206	He 's a prophet of the lord god .	That is a sacred thing which i respect .	and
3	65898	We shall flood the country .	We can close those gates now at the moment of high tide .	if
2	140982	Idle chatter was frowned upon .	Michael nevertheless opened the channel on his hand-held and triggered the transmit switch .	but
3	140283	But , and stay longer if it must .	Need be i shall come again in three days .	if
3	104608	I can sleep on the floor . '' .	It really does make you uncomfortable to share the bed with me .	if
0	115713	Liam took his t-shirt from sean , his back a bloody mess .	Balled it in his hands .	and
0	81921	They were thin yellowed .	Made not of paper but of a kind of parchment .	and
4	11224	To get choked up .	He tried to talk to her .	when
2	33070	That does not always work with claire .	It could not hurt .	but
4	106439	The country had only recently shaken free of soviet control .	Josip left for hungary .	when
4	104053	That hallee had been holding .	He first met her was propped on the shelf of the multimedia center .	when
4	63412	I found a book of stories about him at the hole in the wall bookshop , near the rosebud cinema .	I was four or five .	when
0	151633	To get back to riva .	I 'm not going to leave here until the two of you .	and
0	61727	The reapers would love to get their hands on .	There are security spells on all of them to keep them from being taken out of the library .	and
4	142005	And you could just walk .	The fight was done .	when
0	91492	Who were fleeing from terreille .	Trying to find a fingerhold in kaeleer .	and
2	16583	He is standing in shadow .	I can sense that he is staring at me .	but
2	133969	It was an odd combination .	It was much better than the awful void i had felt .	but
2	67653	This was not their first real date .	They had known each other for many years .	but
0	103436	My feet slip out from under me , as though i were on my deathbed .	Crumpled to the floor .	and
3	140580	'' she asked , `` .	You knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous crimes , why did you keep silent .	if
3	74605	What fate awaits her .	You take her living into the mound .	if
0	127377	Our great island community prosper .	Make sure everyone has work , whether it 's intuit or simple life or terra indigene .	and
0	156747	Your father is human .	He loves us both .	and
4	19127	I 'd been surprised to find that i recognized the photographer 's young assistant .	Claude and i had arrived at the studio .	when
4	52307	He noticed a form in the doorway .	He turned to sit .	when
2	38081	She 's from a place called breman , indiana .	We 've checked the books .	but
2	160167	It was still early autumn , and we were high enough that the air chilled rapidly after dark .	I was wearing only my shift and stays .	but
2	53128	Not letting ozzie out of his sights .	Eyeing as much of the girl as he could .	but
2	92266	It 's taken me a long time .	I 'm finally starting to come to terms with my body .	but
0	75326	I told my custos .	Between him and chax , they were trying to help me .	and
3	82958	I think i 'd combust if you do . '' .	You 're not trying .	if
1	42318	Regardless of the fact that he could very well protect himself , he could not protect himself from an undead .	Simply he was not immune .	because
4	142156	`` missed you . '' .	I sensed it was fading for him i whispered .	when
3	148400	She was conveniently putting herself with him so he could take care of them both at the same time .	He was going after gary .	if
2	67785	Carrying everything at once was possible , and it was awkward .	Brave young men did it .	but
3	72534	Does that make us .	This is what todd and i would do for each other .	if
3	74599	Deep in the back of my mind , i wondered .	She was trying to picture me sitting in a fancy restaurant and not meshing the finn she knew with the finn i needed to be .	if
1	1766	Then my heart picked up in double time .	There stood joe ross .	because
2	26046	I wanted to ask about her .	Felt instinctively that it wasnt the right time .	but
0	15143	The light came on .	He gave a weak smile of recognition .	and
0	155970	The bartender drew the cork with a faint plop , did a double take and put a small amount in a glass and pushed it to sara .	Started to pour the glasses .	and
4	43076	However the dean of our medical school announced that there was a change in plans .	It came time for the envelopes to be distributed .	when
0	71623	Cyrus took my arm .	Helped me to my feet .	and
3	135660	I can turn around and tell them that a stranger broke into my home when i was away at camp and shot my family dead .	Someone asks about my family .	if
2	106224	I called the dogs .	He swung off , and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder .	but
2	18099	She stabbed the nail file down towards his neck , not sure if it was going to do any good .	Knowing she had to do whatever she could to stop him .	but
4	155763	What most scientists do .	They go to work in the morning .	when
0	123176	I quickly glanced around the area of the throne .	Realized there were hundreds of fae and hunters there with us , all staring at the scene unfolding before them as they girded for battle .	and
3	76053	I would love you forever . '' .	You could swing it .	if
2	88847	Getting kyd is fair enough - second only to william shakespeare , of course - before the court .	He is small fry compared to dragging the star writer of the london theatre .	but
3	142281	The results could be devastating .	This secret knowledge were to fall into uninitiated hands .	if
0	142332	They packed up quickly , spreading dazzling light on the world , and spraying beautiful patterns of color across the surrounding hills .	Were back on the road as the sun crested the horizon .	and
2	29483	It was hormones or nervousness .	My mind felt dull and fuzzy .	but
3	67842	He could almost completely shut out the din of anguish surrounding him .	He concentrated hard enough on the past .	if
0	17067	In one hour , they would stop for prayers .	Give thanks to allah .	and
2	144426	It hurt to remove the thing , and .	Even if she did , the result would be disappointing .	but
4	150073	Nathan was looking at her with that same expression from before , equal parts bemusement and disapproval .	She opened her eyes .	when
3	98225	`` then i 'd suggest you get your eyes checked .	That was your boyfriend .	if
2	110058	Still couldnt get over how tiny she had become .	What can i say , my best friend was full of surprises .	but
3	92694	Conor was never sure .	This was because he was acting more like a wolf specifically or acting more like a great beast in general .	if
2	129109	He looks ridiculous he keeps them that way .	He turns them up once and .	but
2	21276	Heather had always enjoyed the purely physical release of sex .	It had never been intense enough for her to forget herself , to lose track of what she believed in .	but
0	139496	This is a beautiful land at another time i would like to travel its length fully at my leisure , but . '' .	Time is not my ally .	and
0	110997	Cole gave me an apologetic look .	Then went after her .	and
2	95957	Which we all battled with our whole lives .	That was completely rattled as we were on the run .	but
4	112159	But be ready to gun it .	I pull out and grab her .	when
0	76975	Giguhl rolled his eyes .	Jogged into the ring like a boxer .	and
3	105623	I knew he would .	He could have curled his lip in disgust .	if
4	17841	Muzzafar gestured for him to remain .	Teg started to stand .	when
0	42678	She held the tiny glistening sphere in her right hand , wincing at the harsh pain in her left ear as her hand moved away threw one full force at the screaming sphere , one meter from her feet .	Gathered the remaining two from the sand with her left .	and
0	20300	Connor settled himself down a bit .	Let maria take the lead .	and
0	153220	He knew what happened to me .	Then he says something completely ridiculous .	and
0	21080	The circle stops its rotation .	The hoods return to their proper upright positions .	and
2	136585	I gave shae a false history .	It was meant for lollys and lady tanda .	but
2	49996	The sky was light .	There was no obvious source of lightno sun , no lamps .	but
4	153449	The worst day for caia came .	The trace told her orina had won the votes .	when
0	51411	There was a second invasion in his dream .	Those particular invaders had absolutely no connection with the servants of the vlagh .	and
2	100985	He unbuttoned his jeans and left them on .	Slid down the zipper .	but
4	37222	Her mouth was opening .	Seamus jerked back with a curse .	when
0	24852	Tolnedra annexes her , though , the alorns will be dragged into it - a war between tolnedra and aloria .	That 's what ctuchik really wants .	and
3	42498	Im here for you .	You need me because youre my brother , pelton and i dont want to see anything bad happen to you .	if
2	35018	Not just he was a white guy .	He was the boss guy .	but
4	126330	Replacing him with a rock .	Cronus came for him .	when
3	70351	What would you think .	I were to move .	if
0	156908	He wanted her baby .	He had no interest in waiting for her to give birth .	and
0	73784	He grew until he was the height of a tree and .	Said , only your remembrance , that i do not sleep .	and
0	84283	The ship 's prow dipped hideously into the outer edges of the maelstrom .	Then raced twice around the huge whirlpool with the oarsmen frantically bending their backs to the frenzied beat of the drum .	and
1	88622	Worse than hooking up with some random girl .	I 'm already guilty of a lot of other terrible things .	because
2	154000	His eyes narrowed a bit .	Then his attention shifted away from her as he pointed at the demons .	but
2	77045	The two councilmen moved .	Christopher continued to address the prince .	but
0	95918	When lvus coaching staff joined their leader .	Met my squad on the fifty yard line .	and
4	18685	He took another bag to fill with her face creams .	One case was packed .	when
3	102829	I will chop off your head right after i chop off your nuts .	You do anything to hurt my daughter .	if
0	63583	Then my master reached inside his robe .	Took out that ordinary , round grey rock he 'd spent the last couple of decades studying .	and
2	119122	The rounds tore through its body , tearing it to pieces .	In seconds it was whole .	but
4	30777	It was clear that the other angel was on the case .	Uneven footfalls began to retreat .	when
3	42190	I will kill him .	He hurt my best friend .	if
1	7320	Are the only one who can find him . '' .	You , dr. granger .	because
2	103876	Id take you to my place .	My niece is visiting this week and i dont want to wake her .	but
3	116221	It would have been drilled through in a second .	I stuck my hand above the trench parapet .	if
0	92355	I forgot how i 'd gotten .	Then i forgot where i was .	and
2	141209	Most reputable news sources would scoff at his tale .	If he looked hard enough , he could probably find one that would n't . .	but
2	135452	This was such a familiar route to her along the loop .	Now , everything about it was different .	but
2	74948	The sorensons were nice .	Their visits had been too infrequent and brief for real bonding to occur .	but
0	145858	Was obviously of canine origin .	Looked quite like a wolf .	and
0	136661	He finally emerged into the day .	Walked the last two blocks to his office building .	and
1	130577	`` or maybe you travel a lot . '' .	It lets you move on .	because
0	128602	There was no way i could be useful .	The glaring fluorescent lights and the gleaming linoleum made a harsh , unfriendly environment .	and
2	109478	Because you 're really pretty , i mean , i 'm not hitting on you or anything . '' .	You have like amazing eyelashes .	but
3	17194	Dr. wells asked georgia .	She was still sad .	if
1	123151	It need not harm mccoy .	Someone or something else was going to , thus saving it the trouble .	because
0	59445	You talk , and the moment you meet the reality you get frightened . '' .	Talk about these things all your life .	and
2	55456	Tegan just looked worried .	She still had her spoon halfway to her mouth .	but
1	94479	Rhett , my clothes are everywhere , because you want to have sex everywhere . '' .	You pull them off of me .	because
0	87153	We had any hope of solving this mess .	Keeping me alive despite some very determined enemies .	and
2	10435	I didnt see anybody .	I knew they were there .	but
0	155640	He could be so cavalier .	On another it intrigued her .	and
2	93001	She knew that he wanted to be at a top paper .	Those positions were few and far between .	but
2	7973	Have no idea who my guy is .	He 's wearing a gray suit , which makes me think that he 's someone older .	but
2	33229	Bev made a mental note .	Decided that the references might be to a family friend who had achieved the status of a quasi-relative .	but
4	33600	You cared about her .	She 's broken and dying inside because you left her without so much as a goodbye .	when
0	9288	He met her eyes . '' .	Said in a quiet , firm tone , `` see to the first lord , countess .	and
2	26546	She kept the jersey in the backpack .	Billy got rid of the rest of the clothing in a garbage can located in the womens bathroom in zone-4 .	but
0	141693	He pulled up the parking brake .	Put it in gear .	and
3	40427	`` you 'll wake everyone up . '' .	You keep shouting like that .	if
4	3107	He placed it on the shelf next to other projects including a diorama detailing the assassination of william mckinley by leon czolgosh that included working lights from the buffalo exposition where the event occurred .	He was confident that the collection was as complete to date as it could possibly be .	when
2	84800	She holds the syllable , and . '' .	She should help you if you can convince her of your sincerity .	but
2	4052	I sat down , so i moved closer to the middle of the house .	Could see the bottom part of cooper 's grave .	but
0	151586	All we needed was the same boost to mortal earth . '' .	We would have had her .	and
4	66873	I ask taylor , but hes too out of breath to answer .	They stop in front of me .	when
1	116496	Charles dropped alice off at the door , so no one would accidentally bang or scratch his car .	He liked to park .	because
3	28362	And , then that was a real possibility .	Someone else could care for him as well as she did .	if
2	122716	The world was spinning in a funny way .	Duncan grimly struggled to answer .	but
2	28705	She tried to lean toward him .	He evaded her , and she resisted the urge to pout at him .	but
2	1282	He had no idea what it was .	After naomi 's description of how close to death he 'd come , he figured it must be important .	but
0	89167	I next slid the side door open , and stepped out into the picnic clearing .	Waded through some milkweed and sugar brush .	and
0	138562	Maggie led her back into the hallway .	Steered her into an examining room .	and
4	12276	He somehow kept her down while freeing one of his hands-which he clapped on her jaw to hold her head in place .	She tried to bite him .	when
0	75811	Two weeks later she passed her four practice flights with flying colors .	It was michael pitts turn next .	and
2	26203	This is really chivalrous of you . '' .	You 're going to strain yourself .	but
2	157741	I want to be f**ked senseless .	More important is the desire to be the only thing he sees , feels , wants .	but
2	153042	If we flew , we could make it in less time .	It is believed that very few bats could make the journey .	but
3	110581	He looked over at her .	Just remembering she was .	if
0	5787	He wanted to pull her into his arms , plant his hands firmly on her butt , his lips right on hers .	Show everyone that he cared about her .	and
2	121053	That had sounded familiar to gabriel .	Which he 'd spent a hundred and fifty years trying to place without success .	but
0	133489	I flushed the toilet , staring straight ahead to the mirrors above the sinks .	Swung the door open wide .	and
0	39570	That could ever happen to you .	Yet thinking only of how it will hurt your child .	and
4	41962	Just over five feet tall , with a childs soft features , mackie surprised everyone .	He pummeled his way to the bare-knuckle championship of the st. louis province .	when
3	6434	And , they want to buy the business . '' .	You marry uncle adam .	if
4	56453	All hes asking you to do is trust him .	You 've got nothing left to lose .	when
2	153268	Jeff worked during the year after football season .	That was only during the spring semester .	but
0	33224	Kira quipped on the bright side .	Got a laugh from her parents .	and
0	27564	Addie took one angry step .	Practically spit out her sentence .	and
2	19178	Not overly muscled in a body-builder fashion and he carried his strength in his features .	He was physically fit .	but
2	68789	She wasnt what any real born again christian would consider a believer .	She did go to church regularly and throw a few bills in the collection basket just in case there really was a god .	but
2	110550	I 've seen pink elephants before .	This one takes the cake .	but
0	64532	Without thinking , she picked up the bowl .	Flung it across the galley .	and
2	64838	Meg called and no one knows where you went .	Said you took off yesterday .	but
0	132996	Figuring it was an advertisement for lawn cutting , i shoved it in my pocket .	Continued my trek to the end of the driveway .	and
2	117143	Q crouched , trying to unlatch my arms from round my ribcage .	I fought him and huddled in the corner .	but
3	85110	Would he come to trust her as much as she trusted him .	She had more time .	if
3	38864	And coming back for jackie then i cant sit around and do nothing .	It is this sesame street killer .	if
2	122928	For the past 3 or 4 weeks since theyve been there llorel has been keeping a certain amount of distance between them , and azalea hated to admit it .	It bothered her ... a lot .	but
4	122585	I stepped in one time right after graduation .	His father was in the middle of beating him .	when
2	118390	Twenty then , he licked his lips .	I get to pick the twenty .	but
0	142422	* * * for the next half hour , kylie sat in the meeting room in the office and pretended like everything in her life was just peachy .	Visited with her mom and smarmy john .	and
3	72792	There 's a big win .	We can get the lethal injection reduced to life without parole .	if
0	83182	I am my mind .	My mind is me .	and
2	20287	Someone once mentioned a young daughter .	Ellie finds that hard to believe .	but
3	33451	What she 'd say .	She could find her voice .	if
1	76580	No one else noticed .	She kept the smile in place and the laughter flowing .	because
2	112650	I spent the night most nights .	It was difficult with her bed being so small .	but
0	80289	Devon leaned in to her friend .	Whispered , isnt that .	and
0	17109	I had been merely acting out of impulse and worry fear to this very point .	Driving myself beyond pain .	and
0	91001	Why the toxins have not worn off .	He hasnt returned to normal , as well as why it affected so manyi must visit the forest .	and
2	11820	I know this is difficult for you .	You still have a lot of options .	but
3	50170	She still had time to jump onto the goya 's dive deck .	She could climb up on top of the sub .	if
3	99663	I 'd have had .	He were standing right next to me .	if
3	97081	It would go a long way in restoring her fortitude .	She could get another hot bath .	if
0	118497	The great gate of halldor had opened .	The dwarven army filed out seven abreast , almost fifteen thousand dwarf in total with thorvaldr at the head .	and
0	74627	Isabella followed sinclair to the bar .	Put in the drink order .	and
4	141071	He looked up at the stairs his blue-gray eyes going directly to mine .	I was at the halfway point .	when
2	56376	Kali hadnt made any noise to betray her position .	Took rhanes silence as her cue for a speedy exit .	but
3	23906	How does she ever expect to marry a good man .	She doesnt give anyone a chance .	if
3	155120	`` , i 'll ask you to delay in any instructions you might have for them until you can share them with me . '' .	You see one of my staff in the meantime .	if
3	131792	Things are not going to end well for wes .	She lounges around on my bed wearing nothing more than a t-shirt .	if
4	105942	He wants them healthy .	He gets to them .	when
0	14638	's call it curiosity .	Leave it at that .	and
2	107304	He wanted to argue .	By then , he knew better .	but
1	74797	Had lived so deeply inside myself , that the other students had stopped even trying to befriend me .	Mainly my grandmother and best friend had died , but also because i 'd become so reclusive .	because
2	20285	She thought of reaching around for his jugular .	He was too far off the ground .	but
4	40166	`` , i 'll shift us back to the tower . '' .	We get outside the front doors .	when
0	140810	Once the door shut behind him , she collapsed on the couch burst into tears .	Put her head in her hands .	and
2	83050	No , i know im not ready to talk to him about miles .	I do want what he is proposing .	but
1	45973	The two species stay .	They provide a mutual defense .	because
2	125466	Well , that may be true , '' jenny countered , `` .	She was also a cynic .	but
0	82003	64 in the council room high in the glass castle , aedion had already marked the exits .	Considered what furniture he could use as a defense or as a weapon .	and
4	46666	For all its great achievement , science has hardly scratched the surface , its inner workings and what may lie beyond the known universe .	It comes to understanding the origins of the universe .	when
2	12629	She scoffed at me a bit and i wasnt really in the mood to hear it .	Opened her mouth to argue .	but
4	14821	I went around and turned off the lights while he made sure we were locked in for the night .	We got back to the house .	when
2	149022	I 'd been a bitch to him .	He was right it had been hours .	but
0	14778	The glass shattered against that second thrust .	She released the material from her grip , letting it float to the floor .	and
0	16425	Vandor still questioned who they were .	To what end their saviors death was brought .	and
3	6260	We will get there faster than if we go on foot .	You flash our way across the state .	if
2	55178	I usually examine all the slaves there . '' .	Since you 're leaving the next morning , we 'll just examine yours on the ship itself .	but
0	19005	The fresh tears stung her eyes made the colors of the square flow into one hot shifting cloud .	To or not , and .	and
2	13331	Walter abrahams might have been short-tempered and hyper-critical at times .	He would give his left arm to someone if they needed it .	but
0	92533	He was riding a spirited black horse .	His face bore the marks of habitual dissipation .	and
0	86053	Tami wanted company getting hers read .	It made her happy .	and
1	57002	At first , rumors were spread but soon everyone learned to keep their council .	Informing another of ones plans could backfire if the other was trying to end your life .	because
4	60916	Women bleed out the contents of their wombs .	Their pregnancy is yet new .	when
0	117873	Still , she could not find hallin .	Did not know yet whether he had survived or .	and
4	23602	You must wave , or mug , or both .	Someone points a movie camera at you .	when
1	63436	His voice trailed off .	Even paul possessed enough tact to know that calling a girl 's hair a `` disaster zone '' was probably unwise .	because
0	144540	The woman opened her palm .	Offered the evidence to felix .	and
0	120197	Jill closed the door behind her .	Dialed her mothers home phone number .	and
0	149230	Even you were doped to the gills .	Running a high-grade fever .	and
3	127284	Left at him then clarifies .	I vomit at the dinner table , tonight mamall know we be close dancing , or something she winks her eyelash .	if
2	19034	Gabby had a sort of friendship with their lead .	Hed chosen to discourage it .	but
3	88520	It only seemed polite to say i did .	I felt the same for him .	if
2	136953	Arianna managed to choke down the food .	She dropped her half full plate back on the tray .	but
4	139452	It was just my imagination .	I heard a knock on the door .	when
4	19512	The boys backed away laughing as emma 's soda shot a geyser of fizz into the air .	Jimmy inevitably succumbed to the temptation .	when
0	46193	Several of the men had retrieved pistols .	Were starting toward victoria and sebastian .	and
3	49405	Was taking it out on you .	It felt like i .	if
3	38011	Nations , tribes , and armies on this planet .	You are not loyal to something you just cant be trusted .	if
3	82772	So , why do you seem to enjoy it .	The garden was your punishment .	if
0	154508	The empire will collapse . ' .	The terror will reign supreme .	and
3	107528	They would have stood trial , been found guilty , and become part of the convict lease program within the year .	They had been caught .	if
2	80463	I knew i was taking a chance .	I had never been disappointed betting on matthew .	but
2	152641	Some of the fusas had far worse injuries .	Barse insisted and when barse insists you do not stand in his way .	but
1	4883	Im glad connick and maura arent on board .	This would probably be the end of them .	because
0	57385	Ad 's jaw unhinged .	He let his mouth fall open .	and
2	60376	Thought i 'd made an impact on her .	It turned out i was wrong .	but
2	117160	Mom looked a little confused .	Seemed to accept what izzy said .	but
4	129869	We were rooting around in it .	Bart set off some kind of trap and was struck with a dart .	when
2	127721	Before , it was i was a magnet and i was drawn to the table , and i was able to shift .	Now someone shut down the field .	but
2	134039	Not she was so interested in what he was doing with the boat .	His every move was graceful and powerful .	but
2	64640	A younger man would not have bothered with .	Otherwise the man in his black muffler and overcoat remained as motionless as one of the obelisks in the graveyard before him .	but
2	40388	It was in a car full of camping stuff . '' .	There was no tent .	but
2	4721	There was no need for a jacket on such a sunny day .	He liked the idea of wearing his recently acquired beige sports jacket over the punky t-shirt , so retrieved it from his wardrobe .	but
1	128350	So what the hell happened , ? '' .	This only happens when i still feel drunk the next morning .	because
3	1206	We started as friends .	Even in some secret deep part of myself , i want to end up so much more .	if
2	142874	Quinn had been gone since sunday night .	He was still sending me text message jokes .	but
2	27973	Had in my dreams and prayers of course .	Wondered if i 'd ever said the words to her so she heard them coming from me .	but
0	48470	The greenroom door opened , holding a big revolver .	I looked up in time to see a woman with a lingerie-model body under a flimsy robe enter the room .	and
2	142960	You 're cool enough about it .	When brandon brought up the subject at dinner , it was clear you 'd been through hell .	but
3	14991	He writes here about a box on legs .	I read this scrawl .	if
0	7140	They oddly fit perfectly , the colors were to-die-for they were not that blasted nightgown ( which i also , by the by , took the opportunity with the lavender soap to clean in the river .	They felt strange on my body but .	and
2	81685	Then she shook her head and .	Glanced at her watch .	but
2	152505	She had been waiting anxiously to talk to him all day .	He returned from shelbyville he was immediately called out to deal with a shooting .	but
3	77561	My actions wouldnt be necessary .	Hed agree to sleep on top of the covers .	if
3	61314	`` , we can keep a little for ourselves . '' .	We give them a little of what they want .	if
4	14997	He continued stalking , taking us deeper into the woods , so far that no one would be able to hear us .	We were past the tree line .	when
4	100813	Four ago `` first we will get a small apartment .	Life was good pandora a little over six years .	when
2	122456	She swallowed , jerking her gaze up .	Regretted catching his eyes .	but
0	152329	The wider parts of the tunic and the bloomers were patterned in gold leaves .	She wore a great quantity of gold jewelry about fingers , wrists , neck , ankles , and toes .	and
2	27820	For a split second she felt as if she had just jumped off a cliff into a deep chasm .	She wouldnt let herself think about it .	but
4	134110	It would be even more difficult for the dogs , whose highly sensitive sense of smell would be bombarded .	They tried to start the vehicles and gasoline sprayed all over the place .	when
3	112952	They no longer had a place in the world .	They no longer did that .	if
3	58422	You should know how that feels . '' .	You want to be a human .	if
0	48641	The dog has seen the sleeping girls legs uncovered was something delicious .	Started to lick them like .	and
3	37577	Ethan needed to touch me .	Even it was just by our hands .	if
4	129203	But , larry happened to be standing by me and he looked at the boy with obvious distrust .	The kid came to the counter .	when
1	100946	He chose to carry a cavalry saber , rather than the customary officer 's hanger .	Both he liked the weight and because it was more visible .	because
2	39315	Sure we were probably invited because we have daughters of similar age and it will be fun for the kids and we are inkids or .	We have just finished a semi-satisfying ( mostly not ) stay-cation .	but
3	41317	And barris would rise to the bait and be visible to everyone flat-out as a clear and evident asshole .	Especially a bunch of people were .	if
3	3458	Ill know who talked .	Anyone finds out about what happened to tabby on that campus .	if
2	31844	Plowed into the muck face-first .	Was successful in grabbing it .	but
0	132775	My neck was pretty sensitive .	His mouth 's intensity had increased .	and
4	84251	You could pay a man a blood price if you had slain one of his animals or peasants '' .	The green kings ruled .	when
1	52910	It was a simple compound to make .	We had a sample .	because
0	138431	They hovered in the air , forming a circle around mencheres .	The bones began swirling around him .	and
0	12129	They sizzled with excitement .	Sparks of love generated by tara 's romantic interlude .	and
1	142417	Three days he was scheduled to appear .	The prosecution 's primary witness against him was brutally murdered .	because
3	62253	She would be thankful , for their presence would add weight and importance to her plea .	Any ghouls chose to escort her into the throne-room of the great ones .	if
4	17731	He delivered a stern lecture on the penalties for impersonating a federal officer .	They crossed into alabama .	when
3	154352	At least he was a polite houseguest .	I had to be saddled with a houseguest .	if
4	83759	Was nearly burned alive .	He drugged her and set fire to the house that .	when
2	102036	One guy is still alive .	I couldnt put him out of his misery .	but
0	36271	I told tuck to break inside , the space was wide open , the energy in my hand giving it a boost .	I let the ball fly .	and
2	59005	The bleeding has stopped .	The gash is red and still very raw .	but
3	91794	You should have your own helmet .	You 're going to be riding on my bike .	if
0	80551	To whisper in her ear .	Fondle her curls in passing .	and
4	59562	Myron 's cringe was barely perceptible .	She smiled this time .	when
2	87712	He knew it and .	He was trying to do something about it .	but
2	20785	The excuse was weak .	It was all she could think of .	but
0	71052	Ah , bellator , welcome , ballen said .	Gestured for me to take a seat .	and
4	136643	She asked , `` how shall we end our sweet torment ? '' .	Her lips were just inches above his .	when
0	124970	I will take those willing .	Start planting just outside the wall .	and
4	1404	It was a moot point .	She called a few days later to setup a dream clinic session .	when
3	80928	`` how did the hackers for my favorite website get all the information about him .	Later he never had the implant surgery .	if
3	87562	You ought to know what sort of man lord fielding really is .	Your andrew does n't come for you , you .	if
2	84442	It was said that this was because his heart was as hard and unforgiving as ice .	Nobody was quite sure where the name had come from , and none dared to ask .	but
0	105639	Marcus ducked his head .	Felt the missile ping against the good aleran steel of his helmet .	and
3	122622	Then we have won .	We reach the raft-boom and cut it before they can man it with archers .	if
0	21698	He managed felt himself in good order when at last he descended .	It was a bit of a struggle to get into it alone , but .	and
2	14240	The stuff really will work accelerating a days worth of healing in about eight hours .	It has a crazy side effect of putting you quickly to sleep .	but
0	58392	She had an uneasy sensation , have you brought other women here before ? '' .	Asked , `` thorne .	and
1	90309	I know . '' .	Jim talked about throwing his dad a big party when he got back from afghanistan .	because
4	1065	Did a double take .	He saw me sitting on his couch .	when
2	86481	The legend became bigger than either of them .	Like most folk stories there was probably a kernel of truth to it .	but
2	111631	He was scared of miles .	He also wanted to tell fats about it , to see his face .	but
2	114758	Its eyes were not yellow blue , and .	They watched her with a mixture of hatred and wanting .	but
0	86219	She found the rhythm of the music .	Decided she just needed to enjoy herself .	and
1	124702	You can always tell when old folks start going .	They stop eating food they used to love .	because
0	27496	Walk to the end of any of the little jetties down by the bank , let your shadow fall on the river .	The mud-yellow water would become , by magic , mud-yellow bodies .	and
4	43423	Herself consider her fathers side .	He was alive so she would do it .	when
4	113316	I bite my lip , thinking organs in favor of the fun ones .	I feel blood flow divert away from all my vital .	when
2	85228	Sky still straddled my body .	Our chests were pressed .	but
0	84838	It crept into a vent .	Traveled through the ducts until it arrived over the classroom .	and
2	106952	Johnny knew he should stay , comfort marah .	He had no words .	but
0	61465	Perhaps he should simply reject promotion .	Yet he felt he could .	and
2	146086	She flashed a dangerous look at him , anyone other than yicle might have cried out in alarm .	He maintained that impenetrable air of charm and suaveness .	but
4	136769	Hear a soft growl .	Roland asks me a question once were outside .	when
0	75664	He gritted his teeth .	Groaned aloud as the fire spread up the inside of his neck and over the right side of his face .	and
0	82954	Otherwise , i would melt the keys .	Never tell the word to anyone .	and
2	150719	The first shot is fired [ 1 .	That 's not the start .	but
2	58744	It 's three o'clock in the morning . '' .	I bring up my contacts and press the one labeled `` mum .	but
1	85457	One memory in particular kept running through my mind .	No matter what emilia 's control was making me feel , my mind kept reminding me that i wanted to marry sofia .	because
2	33609	You may irritate me to no end , i may threaten and bark and bite .	I will protect you till my death .	but
0	146403	Morning came , though it had to be .	No matter how much he tried , he couldnt see any road in the distance .	and
0	159351	Sallie was standing just inside the screen door .	She giggled at us .	and
0	24681	He was tired from the long day .	His eyelids were already getting heavy , drooping as he sat in silence .	and
0	116350	Luring him away from the bars and the roulette wheels .	Urging him to pound the nearest keyboard .	and
2	18608	He was only seven , giving victoria plenty of free time .	Already spent hours each day with math tutors from the university .	but
0	140200	It handed the box to stephan , taking all the warm air with it .	Then left the room .	and
2	78127	She expected to hit the sidewalk .	He pulled her down on top of him and then rolled on top of her .	but
2	106388	You swear , '' i said , `` to be harmless .	Have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you .	but
4	9738	I was at the cabin .	An suv pulled up .	when
0	51783	It was also new raw and .	Reverberating through the bedroom .	and
2	46319	It may not help .	I need to talk to her and hear her side of the story .	but
3	43283	Is it ok with you , pam .	I include jimmies name on our prayer list .	if
2	144075	A bit of wrestling or a few blows exchanged is one thing . '' .	Drawing weapons is quite another .	but
4	19460	To guard my heart .	Another thought shoved into my brain and my body .	when
2	186	Know i 'm being surveyed and analyzed .	It 's because i 'm a suspected informant .	but
0	75471	The nasty man had turned the grill .	Was setting everything on a tray to take .	and
2	84060	That 's not exactly right , maybe . '' .	I reckon it 's close enough for govern-ment work .	but
0	117759	I sent a massive gush of wind at them then i shaped the wind into a gigantic tornado .	Sweeping each one of them up .	and
1	121278	I had to sit at the front left row and was surrounded by four of the prettiest girls in my class .	My last name started with an a .	because
2	56328	I want to say something , anything .	Have no idea what .	but
0	142760	One was grey tall , and .	Armed with a heavy spear .	and
4	90024	Tanner cursed the layers between them .	She ran a finger up his padding .	when
0	69533	He found a curb .	Brought the bike to a rest among the milling throng of bikes .	and
0	70173	But siren was firing at a target .	When she spotted us , she stilled .	and
2	32981	16 a stone of the heart clary hit the button to call simon .	The phone went straight to voice mail .	but
4	112087	He might hurt her .	She was willingly offering him the one thing he needed most .	when
4	137945	Her scent just about sent him into cardiac arrest .	He finally managed to catch his breath .	when
0	38694	At the window , the creature tasted the air with her tongue like a snake .	Thrust her head into the gap .	and
0	68066	To falter for a moment .	Almost loosen his grip on the ladder .	and
2	143236	The federales will have some specific instructions .	I wanted to advise you not to say anything to them about our operations .	but
4	108846	He was blindsided by the strength of what he felt for a woman he 'd just met .	She looked up at him , panting and aroused and so damn beautiful he could hardly believe it .	when
3	82279	It would be a complete disaster .	The king did know lyns real identity .	if
0	126077	Luis drove the first leg of the journey .	Was taking it nice and easy to give us time to panic read through the important case file that mitch had given each of us before the weekend .	and
2	58109	He was paying me .	He was also going to take his sweet time about it , which almost made it worse .	but
2	148165	He meant to turn on a light .	He could he glanced her way and saw she was out of bed , reaching for her dressing gown which was thrown over the armchair in the corner .	but
0	87041	Vamps fled from the pawnshop .	Omorged from the basomonts of the adjacont buildings burning along the stroot .	and
2	121267	Emma was turning him into a total emotional pansy and .	Making him break all his rules .	but
1	23561	Alex 's eyes bounced from my brother to me and she must 've read something in my eyes .	She relaxed and went back to the chessboard .	because
0	60204	You have wasted my time .	Slain an innocent man .	and
0	59993	Dr. cook was growing old .	Thane was getting impatient .	and
0	75676	Vic 's eye snapped open at the sound of the fabric ripping .	He stared at the wolf pup .	and
4	21345	Much later she would chalk up her failure to react to two factors : one , she had been intimidated by vivian because she was a client .	She replayed the events in her mind trying to rewrite the ending .	when
0	124352	Kim had obviously ignored if , a firm specializing in celebrity clients .	She went on about the paralegal position awaiting her at siminoff and wexler .	and
3	56721	I dont know , but i couldnt go on waiting .	That statement had any truth to it or .	if
2	69202	She said cheerfully , `` .	You 're worried about the quality of the food , is that it .	but
4	132385	I backed out of the tent right quick .	I heard the shotgun blast .	when
0	117207	It was harder to show the images to the asp , harder than i 'd thought it would be .	I was soon sweating from the effort .	and
0	46665	Arianna walked to the back of the classroom .	Felt eyes on her as she passed .	and
3	77814	Just like my father , i refused to go through it .	I were to be miserable .	if
2	142165	I am just grateful that the majority of this rabble is too illiterate , apathetic and disorganised to ever pose a threat to the social order .	If they were to ever arise ... why then , endon would be hell on earth .	but
0	71773	The rain had let up .	Even allowed some blue sky to peek through now and .	and
4	115690	I supposedly came here to protect .	Vlad is out there stalking the girls .	when
0	113805	Once there , he flopped .	Almost immediately began snoring .	and
0	62109	He decided he wouldnt let it get to him .	Started on categorizing the amulet and the codex .	and
4	95130	How zina would react .	He gave her the assignment of interrogation .	when
0	116086	They were birds , large and white ; the grass , and the pavement , on the table , on your shoulders , your hands , and your head , till it looked as heavy snow had fallen .	They came hundreds and thousands and alighted on everything .	and
0	129747	The door will be locked ; you must be careful .	Probably have a trap .	and
0	84825	Richard wrote stories and poems .	Drew pictures in the exercise books .	and
4	61611	Her dad had left .	She was a baby and had never been heard from .	when
0	113923	Quickly yanking it out of the wallet , the card he had received from the superintendent fell out .	Floated to the floor .	and
2	102507	He may have thought he controlled the little things in life .	His film exposure brought home the point that the heart or other organs do not necessarily obey ones best intentions .	but
2	93937	Keep away from her , or his arm was frozen .	He tried to reach out .	but
0	148777	He put his arm around her .	She did not shrug it off .	and
3	85812	It would be my right to feed .	You were left this carelethly unattended .	if
2	109499	I really wanted to dismiss her statement on the basis she was demented .	As i saw her expression , i appreciated just how serious , intelligent , and aware she was .	but
2	26510	That i had business in the bar to attend to .	Really i needed a strong wi-fi connection , which was nonex-istent at the cabin .	but
4	92668	Elijah scowled into her eyes , and that scowl darkened even after she had turned .	She looked back at him .	when
4	153362	Still , he was greatly relieved .	The only answer to his question about liking marbles was the timeless melody of moonlight serenade as performed by the glenn miller orchestra .	when
2	112199	`` the lesser wizards had powers .	They were not invulnerable .	but
0	10739	How quickly the lust would build inside her .	How she 'd want to take .	and
2	160052	In there she wanted him to see .	Was obviously worried about violating confidentiality .	but
2	141643	She started to walk away , stopped her , and spun her .	Tully grabbed her sleeve .	but
0	14068	He took her hand in his .	Laid a tender kiss to her cheek .	and
2	138416	Who was not looking at me , bess , alyssa or any of frey 's hot guys .	At thad and jocelyn and i saw her face was thoughtful .	but
2	154147	Becky did not know it , and he would agree .	She could have called him the lowest form of pond scum .	but
2	114187	She had been under the impression that he was a happy , popular guy .	That had just been his cover in the human world .	but
3	26898	We can reevaluate , but if we find one ed thought about it for a moment or two .	We dont see a bug .	if
3	144788	And , i would be turned into a daimon .	I chose not to fight .	if
0	137466	He stormed out of the infirmary , knowing full well that the whole village would notice .	Headed straight for the elders compound .	and
2	50529	Ask the young man anything too stressful .	As she watched , she realised that here was her perfect opportunity .	but
4	44986	The look on his face is somewhere between lust and anger .	His hand strikes my ass .	when
0	2272	Alexia wrinkled her nose .	Looked about for a scrap of fabric for madame lefoux to press against the back of her head .	and
1	67015	When i get out of .	I 'm going to seriously hurt you .	because
3	73429	We need to go . '' .	We 're to have a chance .	if
2	67210	Could you do that one more time , so i can f**k your brains out .	Pull your shorts down for this one .	but
3	61586	But , well few would be changed : that night was .	You/he/she had also done of it .	if
1	23727	Youre probably doing it .	You feel bad about your reaction to my spilling coffee on you yesterday but dont even think about it .	because
0	103809	Begging was a fairly simple occupation .	It gave narasan a great deal of time for thought .	and
4	86149	But then i think of thayer 's teasing smile .	He gave me the scooby , the way he seemed to see right through me in the donovans ' yard yesterday .	when
0	120506	All i have to do is touch someone .	Then they remain invisible until i drop their invisibility .	and
2	21906	Hartman wanted you dead .	Turns out novak wanted to keep me on the leash even more .	but
0	66179	He had his newly oiled sword at brii 's throat .	His newly cleaned gun pointed at ivi as the other man froze in mid-motion of bringing his own gun .	and
2	54231	The equipments been tested .	What were going after that plane and its crew could be twenty feet or more below the surface .	but
2	28495	He no longer had the money to throw at fancy labels , which was all this store seemed to sell .	His welcome was worn at the cheaper shops closer to home .	but
4	66995	Thought about the situation .	I finally got to meet with him at the river .	when
0	91400	The high priest said .	Yet , i do not know who you are .	and
1	90225	In any way '' she was not knowing me .	We had not met till .	because
4	153785	The men plied me with questions about the stranger .	I got to the bunkhouse .	when
4	115595	I pressed my hand gently to his back .	I was standing right behind him .	when
0	19993	The boys will send word , the moment the plane lands .	When they reach seans place .	and
0	55483	One of them picks up speed .	Goes tumbling down the slope of the roof .	and
4	9878	I finally got them .	His lips left mine and went to my ear .	when
4	92782	Sheoh , it is so long since i have heard this tale , let me think .	The daughter saw him .	when
0	63822	Weldas song requires a very experienced fiddle player , habala said , pacing .	Hastin is dancing with jawen , and basha is dancing with sir nicklebys daughter .	and
0	87494	The air force unknowingly was supplying fuel for free to these agencies due to budget cuts .	The flights werent even real business flights .	and
3	143591	I would go ten more .	It would take me to her .	if
0	29969	My dark brown hair was pulled back into a ponytail .	I 'd gone dark and smoky on the makeup , just like bria .	and
2	9341	The conversation seldom came from rodolpho .	When he had the chance , he told octavio about baca 's arrest .	but
2	94709	She had never been able to hide anything from him .	She 'd have to learn to don a poker face .	but
2	18510	Her voice was so beautiful , so clear and cool and soothing , that jacques wanted to cringe from the truth , ashamed .	He could not lie to her .	but
2	114914	Seeing the trees scared teddy for a minute .	His dad being there made him feel safe .	but
1	139579	I had to put the card .	My hand was shaking .	because
2	78325	Where it was coming from he had no i .	He did and he damn well knew it .	but
2	134047	I know this story .	It is such a beautiful piece , i have to read it .	but
2	140760	When i heard she was dead , i felt guilty and angry with myself .	It could never have touched me the way it touched you .	but
3	138036	Though , now that she thought about it , she 'd love to see the look on rolfe 's face .	He found out the truth .	if
0	48227	Her heartbeat picked up .	She ran to the other side of the building and all the way down to where the bushad been parked .	and
3	51550	Duke knew he had to dig into his reserves and make this tender enough to be good for her .	That was the case .	if
2	99171	Daddy was a contractor , did okay .	I had to work my way through school .	but
0	134808	In the next moment , she was pulling an unconscious man around the corner .	Sat him on the floor between us .	and
2	116998	I told him you didnt drink beer .	A formidable line of beverages began to manifest itself in front of her as shepard watched in mock horror .	but
0	146133	Bowing , he took the chest from the hands of the white knight .	Carried it to the dais , where doran martell sat in his rolling chair between his daughter arianne and his dead brother 's beloved paramour , ellaria .	and
2	82651	I wish dad couldve been yur to see this , blod mused .	At least well see ieu tonight .	but
0	112846	Within seconds , he was at the entry to the hallway .	Then he was gone from my sight , val right behind him .	and
4	158965	Peter steered the interview .	Needed and jess watched as peter and johnnie .	when
3	128196	Let me tell you something old man , pointing a finger into his fathers face .	You so much as ever lay a hand on her again it will be the last time you ever hit a woman ; and the same goes for mom .	if
2	146209	Fashionable models exhaust themselves by hunger , prostitutes soak in bathtubs and jacuzzi .	This doesnt make them righteous .	but
3	147668	We 'll ken it soon enough . '' .	There 's aught fishy about the man .	if
3	2814	I no longer knew .	It was mine or the child 's .	if
2	154853	I walked through the town .	I did not see any of them in the houses .	but
0	77221	Riley made a sound .	I shook off her arm .	and
2	110359	Any mention of haiti brings up an image of a population plagued by hiv/full-blown aids .	Mention of the dominican republic evokes thoughts of socks and sandals .	but
2	50785	Id add my two cents .	Until then , he was on his own .	but
4	137143	He had disgust on his face .	Rob looked at him .	when
2	78222	Ok well it wasnt a wall .	Thats what it felt like .	but
2	137184	There were other people around . '' .	No one else seemed to notice him .	but
2	149615	When he saw the valet laying on the ground before the open door , nicodemus 's face went pale , his eyes widened , and .	He took a pair of quick steps to stand behind me , his knife at my throat .	but
4	111965	It had made my heart lighter .	Dr. geller approached me after the funeral with his idea .	when
0	36930	Either one of the posses could have run down one or two men .	Killed or captured them .	and
0	22717	The journey across the field took far longer than they hoped .	It was fifteen minutes later when they finally clambered over the stile into thicketts lane .	and
2	26347	She had diabetes ... then gran was too sick . '' .	She put her needs on the back burner to help out when my mother tried rehab .	but
0	59460	These tights , ' he winced and .	Tried to do some surreptitious rearranging in an effort to prevent himself becoming the city 's first hunchgroin .	and
2	84302	The princeling had proven his worth and he was still just a boy and had a lot of growing up to do .	Earned a little trust .	but
2	153179	There used to be seven of us . '' .	There are only four of us left .	but
2	85354	I 'd much rather stay here for the rest of the night with you , locked together like this . '' .	We have to go .	but
3	23384	We 'll just kill her .	She steps out of line .	if
3	74890	I will marry you .	You promise to give me at least a mouth .	if
3	141624	Was i really going to kill her .	She was a vampire .	if
0	6286	He 'd probably have me on the ground , if he were given the least excuse .	Handcuffed inside of five seconds .	and
2	51649	She didnt know what the issue was .	She was going to offer her dogly protection and compassion to her master no matter what the situation .	but
2	49014	He didnt attend any of my other classes except math .	She always walked him to class .	but
3	86215	Considering how their lives had been affected these past two weeks , mars would have believed him .	Hed told her he was a secret kgb operative working under elvis presleys instruction .	if
0	95433	He gave her a wink .	Dashed past her into the wilderness , not giving her a chance to protest .	and
0	35472	He closed his hands around her shoulders .	Hauled her up against his chest .	and
3	63835	Well ill just have to settle for dinner and dancing .	Youre going to get cheap on me .	if
0	4277	She 'd chosen him to be her partner .	She was counting on him .	and
3	75455	Aside from forfeiting the opportunity to kill lepage , he risked being discovered as a german agent , only to be confronted in the company of the guests .	He returned to the party .	if
0	115009	She crossed the nearly frozen-over bergendal river .	Continued through the pine-covered bergendal mountainside and on to odinseat .	and
4	21891	How much better it gets .	You approach the real thing .	when
3	133352	I might have screamed .	Someone had poked me in the .	if
4	38928	I noticed his singular paleness , and i asked him : `` what is the matter with you , jean ? '' .	I went back home yesterday .	when
0	101895	When she stopped fighting him .	Started struggling to get his clothes off his body .	and
3	79422	You , kate , will never carry curran 's child .	The bear has his way .	if
3	130649	To ride like the wind .	We expect to lose those guards .	if
2	2031	At first jayson found the new dancers movements to be unpleasantly vulgar .	Observing for a few minutes he grew to appreciate her positionin a manner of speaking .	but
1	146619	Do not ask me .	How i am not sure how myself , apart from me avoiding being alone with them at all costs .	because
0	37751	Dusty gold shafts pierced the canopy .	Made dapples of the insubstantial brook to his left .	and
3	3340	She could easily have been killed .	The small mercedes had hit one of the huge pines that thickly lined the road head-on .	if
2	53945	You have jurisdiction for the initial inquest .	We have prosecution rights .	but
3	130198	It doesnt seem to extend to baby brothers .	There is sympathy in the world .	if
0	95963	Aden will want to fight fair .	Will actually care about collateral damage .	and
3	87113	Wonder , pretty as you please .	Eric will really be `` loyal '' to me while my father sits .	if
2	53783	I still had another job .	I only worked about sixteen hours per week there , hardly enough to pay my bills .	but
0	64580	She unfastened the mask from her face , tossing it onto the table in the center of the foyer .	Sighed as the cool air met her flushed skin .	and
0	159287	`` i 'm sookie stackhouse . '' .	This is my friend , john quinn .	and
3	101528	You will be given eyes to see and ears to hear .	You ask and then listen .	if
2	80920	Wikim just stared at the fire .	Balat tossed his to her .	but
2	48427	This one was smaller .	It still took her a few good pulls to force it shut .	but
0	41907	Ive had this game fifteen years .	Ive never once completed it .	and
4	52715	He started rising at five in the morning so he could squeeze two workouts into a day .	He realized that effort , not genetics , usually separated the winners from losers in races .	when
0	5355	She flipped up the cover on the launch console .	Pressed the red button .	and
2	60461	Goods will be cheaper and more plentiful .	That leads to people treating them like they 're disposable .	but
2	17499	He is being blackmailed .	Not he is the killer .	but
3	82974	I never found out .	That was true or .	if
2	27867	I have a lot to do and .	I 'd like to be .	but
2	123258	It should be pretty simple .	Ill be happy to check it for you .	but
0	146947	The stone steps were rough cold against the soles of her bare feet , but .	She went as fast as she dared , despite a still-woozy head .	and
3	135320	Id say you were preoccupied with little miss-whats-her-name .	I didnt know any better .	if
3	157295	However then that is good .	You realize that youve made a mistake because you recognize the error of your ways and you make an effort to change .	if
0	114623	Reaching down , he took jaikus hand .	Hauled him the rest of the way out .	and
0	69593	She felt the brief flutter of its wings against her palm .	Tried to remember what it had been like to feel afraid .	and
2	29373	Hannah stirred under the blankets .	Her eyes remained closed .	but
4	97668	What 's left over .	A deep injury has to heal on its own .	when
3	152219	Who 'd be looking for her .	She came up missing now that she 'd lost her job .	if
3	79530	'' said the woman , smiling .	I 'm not interrupting .	if
0	141996	Sit down , cherie has . '' .	Let 's watch the video nelson .	and
2	39133	I probably should have stayed in .	I 'm tired of obsessively thinking about what might be happening to patrick .	but
4	151843	Me groan in sympathy .	Your horse knocked the top rail on the triple jump .	when
4	29902	How that had happened .	He got back home .	when
1	91454	The audience laughed and hoped that the audience would laugh , if people didnt laugh he would be very disappointed .	The musician was actually a comedian .	because
0	152868	Oh , yes , sorry , he replied .	He passed her a mug .	and
2	130341	Not only was there a back door , and i bit down on the bingo i wanted to shout .	There was a sliding glass patio door .	but
0	137430	`` you might go in there , '' .	Bring out her picture .	and
4	149401	It is my business , and the other one happens to be my ex .	One guy shows up at my front door .	when
0	78433	Who were not recognized by their fathers .	Admitted into their houses legally became members of the `` city-house '' of whichever high lord held authority over their birthplace .	and
0	40071	School will be out next week .	I 'm kind of going to miss it .	and
3	30394	There was nothing she could do about it , and it was a hard pill for her to swallow .	He chose not to go to college .	if
0	137187	They needed a map .	Rascal painted one , even if he didn '' t know it .	and
1	18069	I hoped luther could swim .	This maneuver looked precarious .	because
0	107607	`` it 's expected that after the ball we 'll have a late dinner in our rooms , '' charlotte murmured .	Adjusted the strap on sophie 's left shoulder .	and
3	131814	How would they get to the fort , or even back to fort douglas .	There was anything left .	if
3	30398	He was the ugliest member of the i.o.o.b. .	One could be said to be uglier in that gross group of creeps .	if
0	113002	He waved it off .	Teleported again as she resumed fire .	and
0	146858	She brought the cup of tea to her lips .	Sipped the hot liquid .	and
0	133780	I 'd shattered reappeared .	Displayed a fresh scene of manhattan , one where sofie stood surrounded by caden and the others .	and
3	122629	You 'll have to tie me up .	You plan to give her back to the navy .	if
2	70078	I was a free man , never afraid to be .	Now , ever rooted in frenzy .	but
0	75989	He gave an exasperated sigh , then got back on the stretcher and leaned back on his elbows to wait for tate .	Left his clothes to hang against his forearm .	and
1	152421	The window caught after about an inch .	The home had been painted so many times over the years .	because
2	7071	Which would not be difficult for the council to arrange .	There was no sense in mentioning that to the girl .	but
0	115593	Even the last mortal died .	The rest of us faded .	and
2	30684	It 's behind you . '' .	You took on the club , and you will live by the club rules .	but
2	17446	I usually charge eight shillings .	I can let you have it for six .	but
4	94269	You 'll be missing a pair . '' .	I 'm done with you .	when
0	40205	They both perfunctorily genuflected to the altar .	Then sat on a polished bench near the front of the chapel .	and
2	129723	It 's one thing to know your archives are woefully inadequate .	It 's a completely different ball game when your nose is rubbed in it .	but
2	24547	She tolerates charles and me because we feed her .	It 's a tenuous relationship at best .	but
2	108316	I wanted to spike the ball and i answered with reserve : yes , sir .	Do an obnoxious victory dance .	but
2	85418	I swallow hard and for a millisecond i consider running .	Instead i take a deep breath and walk right in and around the curtain .	but
4	156381	The responses were so indistinct that he was timing his leading of the liturgy to the length of time he knew it took worshipers to give each response .	A mere handful of parishioners attended mass .	when
0	119655	Afterwards , there would be a boat they would sail .	Brought there by some faerie friend of oberons .	and
0	154706	Why dont you set the table .	We can discuss our fetishes .	and
4	135670	I was putting the dishes .	He came out into the great room with nothing on except the towel wrapped around his waist .	when
0	99756	His hand was resting on .	Followed in the direction lucan had gone .	and
2	133379	Carpathians were predators , not prey , and .	Dax was a hunter of immense skill and drive and determination .	but
0	5141	He went back to his lodgings .	Had a look at himself in the mirror over the washbasin .	and
0	134253	I came to true life not long after the end of it i remember the stories .	`` i am too young to remember , for i was not yet aware , '' brii said , `` but .	and
3	158737	They would have to devise a better long-term solution .	He was to take up permanent residence in town .	if
0	2377	You are our rival enemies .	We look forward to seeing morchads army win the war .	and
4	1490	Such innocence was necessary .	You were twelve years old .	when
3	138340	Then the least i can do is walk you to your car . '' .	I 've managed to chase you off .	if
1	64172	You would never take on an apprentice .	They only get in the way .	because
3	148950	But , i can do your makeup . '' .	You want me to .	if
0	28588	The trucks had been unloaded .	The supplies carried inside the cave .	and
0	19628	He inched his fingertips around to her pulse .	Noted the rapid tat of her heartbeat .	and
3	36768	His family will never know .	The fresh turn died .	if
3	43800	What was waiting for me on the other side .	Roaden was playing some kind of trick and another zombie .	if
0	95983	Pat said the lava was flaming red instead of black .	It flowed with the slow heaviness of half-cooled grease .	and
2	53811	Putting his clippers away , `` .	I hope i am not too old to do what i feel .	but
4	92517	The ship would have perilously little energy left should they need to enter into combat .	They arrived at earth .	when
1	58760	Coming out of my mouth .	I never want to talk about anything .	because
2	101629	Every few steps , vinnie would jerk against his captors , trying to break free .	It was no use .	but
2	155166	More than once he 'd run across a child he would have liked to help .	It was necessary to go to ground .	but
0	108580	But even as i tried to reassure myself , my uncertainty refused to disappear .	My sister 's poisonous words returned to me .	and
4	38495	There will be trouble on the reserve .	We get back home .	when
2	10434	His face was shrouded in darkness .	Colton could tell that he was staring directly at him .	but
2	77157	`` well , that sounds very dramatic , '' kresh said , `` . '' .	All i can see is what looks like some sort of broken-off attachment clip and a torn bit of flat cable .	but
2	87827	Not only was i armed .	I was suitably attired-for bustles , crinolines , and tight sleeves are cumbersome and impractical for a pedestrian on shadowy streetwalks .	but
3	83740	Listen neither one of us will ever have to work .	We pull this thing off .	if
0	13974	Thomson was moving far too fast , dazing gisbo enough to cause him to flinch .	Only graced his temple with another blow .	and
2	140517	As i said , i thought so too , at first , and im sure her condition has exaggerated her impressions , but when i spoke to her daughter , well , of course , i cant say for certain .	I dont think its the mother , or not only the mother in any event .	but
2	58959	They 'd not only ended up as barren stumps .	He 'd accidentally taken out a few of the neighbors ' .	but
2	60324	`` you 're eating as if you 're expecting triplets , '' he teased .	The way his mouth lifted up at the corners told her he was pleased .	but
0	62179	Tyler cracked the window .	Inhaled as we moved slowly down the road .	and
3	48611	It deserves everything it gets .	This heap of junk starts steaming in sub-zero temperatures .	if
2	116151	The landing was painful and not as bad as you 'd expect .	Knocked the air out of him .	but
2	59704	In twice the time it should have taken me .	The cold made me move more .	but
4	485	He 'd landed after a series of touch-and-go 's .	He was first learning to fly .	when
3	26683	You should probably try the hospitals and the jail .	Too you have no luck .	if
4	138072	He started to get up but she beat him to it .	The meal was done .	when
1	54753	When isis ruled in achaia she rarely met with opposition .	Partially no one would challenge a former god and certainly not one as powerful as she .	because
3	38255	I can recover in my lair . '' .	You can help me down to the basement .	if
2	49076	To meet us at the restaurant .	Everyone else had plans or excuses .	but
0	16303	The city was razed .	Her people slaughtered or enslaved .	and
0	129548	They had not been stoned yet , nor his back throbbed and itched and burned , sapping the energy even to be afraid .	Offered any other violence but words .	and
0	44195	Getting an imp was turning your life over to someone .	They were never ever to do it .	and
2	16274	She sounded so happy .	It was a fake happy .	but
0	51433	My son has indeed been kidnapped , she said , her voice shifting into the grieving mother spectrum .	I am truly frightened for his safety .	and
2	54618	She had found a pair of my pants .	Could only find a shirt that belonged to my father and looked like it might drown me .	but
3	5111	Why did you not lead us there .	We have to go around the wall ? '' .	if
4	83063	`` warlord , '' he said quietly , `` even a rogue knows . '' .	To yield to a queen .	when
0	63228	Second he was standing a good three feet away from me .	The next his hands were gently clasping my cheeks .	and
0	26404	Any of garion 's other friends would have immediately raised a general outcry .	The entire affair would have been irrevocably out in the open .	and
0	87812	He has feelings for her .	He is important for her .	and
2	50654	`` you 're right , we need to do something . '' .	We have to do it .	but
4	157228	It was four bedrooms .	He bought the house .	when
2	50436	I may be impossible . '' .	I 've gained you entry into the most fashionable ball of the season .	but
2	4527	Therefore , she nodded .	She did it while still glaring .	but
0	138046	His wife and lola were also thrown into the air .	They landed in a heap , in front of dwayne .	and
2	115600	`` that sounds amazing .	We have to go to dinner .	but
1	129528	That came from ugliness into something beautiful-more .	I was self-conscious about the scars or whatever .	because
2	9133	Who want to meet .	Go about it in a very complicated way .	but
0	128695	The day was bright , without a hint of clouds .	The sun was hot on kaladin 's back .	and
4	1583	You arent exactly sure what youve said and what you havent said .	Things begin to get a little hazy .	when
2	92876	Okay , i know how that sounds .	I swear its not what youre thinking .	but
0	50689	A bedsheet squeezed through an upper window .	Flapped away across the rooftops .	and
0	96506	`` no damn way , wolf , '' maya snapped .	Brody pressed closer to her .	and
0	12356	The guards obviously pulled steam rollers uphill for a hobby , but they were no match for charlies wallet .	Both of them had seen less secure gates protecting maximum security prisons .	and
0	140740	He related to people , empathized with them .	Wanted them to be better .	and
0	151878	She looks around , grinning at her .	There stand eddie and jake .	and
2	17287	She can try a countersuit against me .	If she moves against the bureau , we can ask for a seratori hearing , a personal confrontation .	but
3	119470	The nba will probably say you 're too much of a health threat to ever step on the court again . '' .	Even the virus goes into remission .	if
2	33089	She had lived here all her life .	Had never seen this area .	but
0	154392	He pulled his shaking hand free from garion 's grasp .	Reached out toward her .	and
3	69937	It 's another teratoma ... or maybe a teratocarcinoma .	It 's like all the others .	if
4	101096	Were all fogged up .	He reached mayville he saw robs car and the windows .	when
0	90604	They were hardly on terms of any intimacy-he bent .	Sealed the young man 's mouth with his .	and
2	68474	He was asking me something simple .	It felt endlessly more complex .	but
3	11809	I think the good lord above controls most everything for us .	That will help honey .	if
0	58523	That flutters before the flame .	Disappears before i can catch it in my hands .	and
1	149832	No way she was going to watch him slowly starve .	He wanted to die .	because
3	68181	What would have happened .	I 'd asked for bacon .	if
3	102509	That was her cross to bear .	Lucas went after her .	if
0	54070	I went because i had a feeling , seeing as i was still running and not thrown to the snow or being carried away , that these were the good guys .	Fast and i did it feeling slightly better .	and
2	117088	I dipped my hands into the coal .	Most of it was either wet or pure ash .	but
4	31308	She asked lloyd , who happened to be around to drive her to melton media .	She reached the town house foyer .	when
0	78165	Lianna would turn him .	It broke his heart , so what .	and
3	91394	Wont be able to control field agents .	They decide to avenge their comrades .	if
4	92442	She felt a keen sense of regret .	His hand drifted away from her breast .	when
2	41968	He could have scavenged himself an old mattress .	He was too tired to drag it through the tiny gap .	but
0	68318	I will knock the station phone off the desk as i leave .	It will be conveniently close enough to you for you to use , with difficulty .	and
0	157422	To overcome your fear of death and harm , at least to some extent .	To do what must be done regardless of consequences to yourself .	and
2	23219	Sutekos voice was muffled by the towel pressed against her face .	It was clear she ashamed at the problems already caused by her family .	but
4	111854	He grabbed me and shook me so hard that the room started spinning .	I tried to push past him .	when
2	138885	Yesterday the silence between us was fine .	For some reason , it 's incredibly awkward tonight .	but
3	48113	In fact , he felt he could go .	He were to die now in his mothers arms .	if
4	62002	The jaguar screeched to a halt .	I hit the brakes as hard as i could .	when
0	146987	Not to mention i flew across the world .	Fought an army to get .	and
3	83130	Hundreds swear they did .	I did not see her fall .	if
0	125759	Then both mele and kele took out a cloth helped out .	Mostly it just smeared around , but .	and
2	475	`` we 'll go back to prolgu the way we came .	I need to talk to relg .	but
2	135699	Hold up there , jessika .	She just keeps on going at it .	but
2	39823	New york state had once been a linchpin in keeping the national power in the northeast .	It had been losing population for decades .	but
2	111764	I was going to tell them .	Then i just stopped .	but
0	101959	She rose from her chair .	Signalled to a guard .	and
0	75937	`` she 's right , '' she whispered in his ear .	I felt my own neck start to tingle .	and
2	135471	I stare at the handwriting .	It is blocky and unrecognizable .	but
0	145862	Put them in wagons . '' .	Send them toward riva as fast as they can go .	and
4	24389	She glanced back to see that his expression was grim and determined .	He cleared his throat .	when
4	97204	I finally faced the fact that it could only be one of three men who had attacked me .	I pushed the button for my floor in the parking garage elevator .	when
0	87296	We 'll slip out of here , and we 'll disappear . '' .	We 'll leave town .	and
4	39929	Getting his hands dirty .	It came to that .	when
0	68918	I was shivering in reaction .	Even dawson looked nauseated .	and
0	140610	Fifteen years past , when they had ridden forth to win a throne , the lord of storm 's end had been clean-shaven , clear-eyed .	Muscled like a maiden 's fantasy .	and
2	152354	Imagine ripples in a pond , but .	Imagine that they dont die away for a long time ; when they reach the edge of the pond , they bounce back and cross the pond .	but
3	155512	How will we ever be ready in time ? '' .	You keep disobeying me .	if
4	66487	He laughed at the whole courtship .	He found out about it .	when
0	124392	He tasted of brandy and sweetness .	The way he sucked on my lower lip made me moan .	and
2	35971	I should have told you that i loved you before you walked into that hospital .	I really believed that i never had a chance .	but
4	50382	To guard the home of a terrorist .	The fbi had seemingly already removed everything that was not bolted down from there .	when
1	86185	I smiled to myself .	I 'd given her that sharpie at the top of the summerville water tower , not so long .	because
4	131535	The madness was in full control .	He turned back to winston .	when
0	44315	Raising brandon alone and myself was not the ideal way to handle things .	Working full-time to support him .	and
4	84980	The man was gone .	She glanced back at the window .	when
0	74776	So dektri had taken on his fathers life ambition .	Had become an importer of exotic goods from jahiro .	and
2	85744	Im smoothing down my hair with my right hand , but i cant bring myself to speak , to say anything , except some half hearted stutter .	Shes standing next to me now and the heat from her body is touching me as she puts her finger to my lips .	but
0	149530	Then the tchindi went to him .	I heard him scream for a moment .	and
2	62725	Their return to reality was inevitable .	Still , the few days they 'd been able to escape were a fairy tale she 'd never forget .	but
4	3486	`` are you trying to bargain with me ? '' .	I 'm teaching you how to write .	when
4	110598	It had been late in the afternoon , the voice of a man yelling .	He heard the disturbance .	when
0	18618	He lifted his right eyebrow .	Smirked at bea hovering midair .	and
4	150317	Frankie had been dead right .	He 'd said everyone knew except nell herself and kyle .	when
4	110323	Mackie would have been the one to bring him any special summons to duty , but mackie was the least dependable of the men on the savannah .	The port crew worked topside .	when
0	62310	Cassie kneeled down stuffed the book inside .	Pulled it out into the light .	and
4	53501	A day away from mildew , and only a day , he had thought to himself .	He rolled the bales heavy with rain and ran his gloved hands along the baling twine and slashed it open .	when
3	84835	I would catch her in less than a second flat .	I didnt have these stupid crutches .	if
2	72820	Taryn 's stomach jumped .	She forced the emotion .	but
3	138313	And the horse degas began to sweat .	You do not get .	if
0	160642	He made his way west toward tower hill station , beside a large gray jut of wall .	Stopped a little before the station .	and
2	102809	I was just some stupid kid , and their unsub is killing people who look like my mother and people who hold a similar job , and he 's doing it with a knife .	Now briggs and locke have this case .	but
0	66840	The ornate door to the queens apartments swung inward .	Miranda stepped out , regal in a dark orange gown trimmed in pale gold flowers .	and
2	866	The sun had almost set , bleeding red into the clouds .	It was still warmer up here than down in the depths .	but
0	110592	The shop owner pulls out an iron from under the counter .	Starts to smooth out the application .	and
2	6502	Who we were , who we had always been , and what resided within us .	I believed it was what had caused the humans to come up with the legends of demons .	but
0	24494	Dr. atkinson zipped up his stiff new red parka .	Walked out of the prefab building where he was berthed while transiting mcmurdo .	and
3	138683	I 'm not even sure . '' .	I can sleep with that thing in the room .	if
4	20221	Spied a male in the icy shadows .	A footstep crunched in the snow , she whirled .	when
0	34185	He could gather his courage .	Climb out of his hiding place .	and
3	106630	Plus they get even in very unsettling ways .	You yell at them .	if
0	61181	She reached the side of the manor house .	Deposited her stone with a hidden sigh of relief .	and
3	156672	I sometimes wonder , but if you could have seen olives response to taking communion .	Im living an ends justifies means existence as a minister .	if
4	56955	She decided to run into town to pick up something for refreshments .	She found out you were dropping by .	when
0	35167	But he 'd gotten halfway to the pyre , a stacked pile of stripped wood , white as bones .	Realized he could go no farther .	and
4	146240	Which inevitably give way .	The lads climb up to use them as a trampoline .	when
0	137113	The last word had resonance .	She watched him close his eyes and weave on his feet .	and
0	157919	All my parents will be attending .	I dont want to smell like smoke .	and
3	158189	To give him any credit-but .	He 'd been there for her when she needed him , why would he have turned on a scared little boy .	if
2	136291	Jail would be horrible .	Jail in miami had a particularly ominous ring to it .	but
2	55779	She regretted every word .	When emma had asked her how she became a confidant , the whole story came back to her .	but
2	143850	I recognize the voice .	It 's too late .	but
2	89229	The bartender was also smiling .	His smile had a slightly concerned edge to it .	but
4	89541	And being a complete neanderthal . '' .	It comes to aussie road rules .	when
3	45102	Evening sun is fine to watch from the porch , deacon .	Youd care to smoke .	if
4	19567	Tears started to fill my eyes .	I saw jimmy , rosie , richard , mandy , veronica , and connor and ellery standing by the white chairs that were decorated with flowers .	when
4	29170	Cueva community is shrinking in size .	People get the chance to leave .	when
3	1198	A story , here 's what they would be .	I had to pick the top three things i love about each of my friends .	if
0	110216	... '' she said .	I could hear the smile in her words .	and
2	88281	Drina wanted to be able to visit the girl here on occasion .	Would never inflict that on harper if coming here would stir bad memories for him .	but
4	136957	In fact i saw two cups instead of one .	I took a closer look at the tea tray .	when
2	65891	He grimaces as the shoulder grinds .	He must continue to loosen it until he has enough range of motion to attempt flight .	but
2	118258	Zephyra had thought she 'd stab him the moment he touched her .	The instant his lips were on hers she remembered why she 'd married him .	but
3	144302	Im so in love with you , it feels .	My heart can not contain it all .	if
0	38378	The whole mess had been noisy as hell .	We 'd pissed off an entire nation of wicked fae in the process of making it .	and
2	122512	Just i heard the knock i was reminded of mishas words about not eroticizing the feminine .	The moment was too charged to resist .	but
2	34168	True , he had played that trick on her in the clearing , setting up the picnic on the posies .	He had also given her an escape from that , offering to return to the castle before they sat down .	but
0	79552	She could turn it over in her mind .	Somehow make sense of it .	and
3	13789	He thought it would help .	His neck was on the line he 'd give up his online contact .	if
0	75030	The tallest of them shook his head .	Then they took the door down with their shoulders .	and
0	105852	Now she waits tables .	Helps out in a nursing home to get through university .	and
2	97985	Well that would certainly make things easier being able to communicate in his own language .	Even so , english or not , approaching a total stranger and asking for a free breakfast was not something paul felt overly confident about .	but
2	94103	In the strict hierarchy of the brotherhood blake is far more powerful than monfort .	Blake is moving away from the agenda he is open to challenges .	but
4	87015	He had been burned in the past .	It came to parking and being towed , harry didnt like taking chances .	when
2	117144	He wanted to hug this wonderful thing .	Hugs were just a distant memory .	but
2	109912	I am not sure i should write about it .	She says that in america there have been large demonstrations by women , both in washington and new york .	but
3	55215	The taint of being accused could shadow him the rest of his life .	Even he was declared innocent .	if
2	53147	I pulled away as much as i could .	My chains kept me from going .	but
2	75048	I wanted to go back for my notebook .	I knew it was covered with barf .	but
0	23070	She follows her intuitive thoughts .	Sneaks over quickly to the door .	and
2	156784	It was at the bottom of the ship .	Instead of looking downwards at the moon , they were looking outwards at the moon .	but
2	134149	And coraline had to make sure she dressed up warm before she went out , for it was a very cold summer that year .	Go out she did , exploring , every day until the day it rained , when coraline had to stay .	but
2	129732	General kearny was sympathetic .	Had little to offer .	but
2	123125	Do for her what i could not how can he do that without proving himself a worthy knight .	He must go back to marseilles and .	but
0	11226	He was hiding his feelings from her .	She wondered if there was any way to draw him out .	and
0	136000	The glue sets in minutes . '' .	Is guaranteed not to leak .	and
3	105509	Getting her out of the country would prove less difficult .	Her employer colluded with them .	if
2	46213	The doorbell rang , and somehow she doubted it .	Amanda would love to think she 'd been saved by the bell .	but
0	106471	Joining her on the bed .	Pulling her into his arms .	and
0	3651	The locals ran out of ammo .	They couldnt defend themselves when a horde of zombies came through .	and
0	54956	Her muzzle had gone grey , her tail and mane had thinned to stringy tendrils .	She moved with ponderous slowness .	and
2	69604	I 'm really , really flattered you asked .	Camille , like raphael , always spoke stiffly , formally , as if she were in a fairy tale .	but
4	36818	Pulling hard , with one foot against the doorjamb .	Jane gasped and jerked him to one side .	when
3	151244	Have been fed like this every day .	Putting up with them .	if
2	41077	You can not know how much , viper . '' .	You must think what will occur if the anasso dies .	but
0	14182	Zane 's head titled to the right .	He stared hard at erin 's face .	and
0	100136	To call you jeff .	You to call me jenny .	and
2	142751	He tried to pass me .	I shook my head .	but
0	105870	He dropped out of his saddle .	Scanned the grass where kemeny was pointing .	and
2	3494	Jackson looked all offended for a sec .	Then changed his face into this blank smile .	but
2	8323	About to do , against our laws , so , slowly , i made my huge white wings appear .	I wanted to help this desperately frightened man in front of me .	but
4	60636	But , an overweight , middle-aged , officious-looking woman was anchoring darrens desk .	She rounded the corner this time .	when
2	143570	Jd 's eyes were still wide and confused .	He was smart enough to stay quiet .	but
0	142999	To throw owen off him .	Scramble to his feet .	and
2	104754	Clipped his toenails in a couple meetings . '' .	He gave me a goose last christmas .	but
3	119982	You would not be .	You did not already know the answer .	if
0	69991	This oison had hurt misty , for that , he 'd die .	Had tried to enslave her .	and
2	149775	I was joking , at that point .	Hell , it was as good a guess as anything .	but
0	116697	I pulled the covers up over her , and then wiped a tear off her cheek .	Kissed her warm forehead .	and
3	130765	That would be possible .	Your loving soul hadnt imprinted upon your consciousness .	if
2	97011	Louis tried to roll back to his right away from frank .	Stumbled on a hidden rock , which broke his concentration .	but
0	51345	As she walked out the door smiling , she paused .	Looked back at him .	and
3	129150	You are old enough to know about using protection ! '' .	You are old enough to have sex .	if
0	65412	Then again , a lot of what shaw had been up to since the last time they talked , was a mystery .	Shaw decided to expand project yeagher .	and
2	123805	I had the windows of the car open .	I was afraid to get out and look closer .	but
2	88877	We had bowling practice that night .	I 'd wanted to talk to him in private .	but
3	114043	I 'd never get to the office in the morning .	I picked up every crazy call after midnight .	if
3	56786	He can kiss my ass .	He wants to start talking feelings with me .	if
0	74884	A clean-limbed young giant emerge from the shadows into the firelight .	Come quickly toward her .	and
3	128858	We would not hold the trench .	Attacked by the germans in combat .	if
2	54229	Who the other woman was .	She was hurting della .	but
2	59545	When the season begins , i would be long gone by this time .	This morning i wanted to examine everything in the daylight , so i delayed , lazily luxuriating on the cot .	but
4	110601	Two years later , and it still hurts .	I see him with liz , even though i really like her .	when
2	41741	Something else tugged at my heart , and , that this boy who had lost everything should be denied such basic information about his own family .	It was caused by the knowledge i possessed .	but
4	150299	They create some sort of illusion , and one of them seems to be missing .	I sit on one of them .	when
0	79551	I went back to the barrier without hesitation .	Laid my hands upon it .	and
2	142777	I did i need new jeans and .	There 's a wait on the shirts .	but
3	74298	The others would simply remain here to build a life away from golconda .	They found it possible .	if
2	21759	He had been sitting hunched forward in his chair , but half-believing still against his will .	Sat back now , looking at her with the half-skeptical expression of a younger brother listening to a sister 's fairy tales , feeling himself too old to be amazed .	but
4	81628	I was supposed to kill the commissioner .	He was dining alone in uncle luigis banquet room last year .	when
4	75022	How happy she had been .	She had gotten her law job .	when
0	72207	Patrick drew oy to him , all the while looking at susannah and roland with wide , unhappy eyes .	Wrapped an arm around the bumbler .	and
2	912	It got their attention , all .	It also upped the tension another thousand degrees .	but
2	61986	She wanted to use the woman 's name .	Felt uncomfortable asking it .	but
4	80092	But , my family was gone .	I got home this morning .	when
0	12028	He put it down with distaste .	Stepping around the woman on the floor , grabbed the safe-deposit boxes containing the jewelry .	and
0	154656	Crossing the floor , he sat on the edge of the bed .	Drew her into his arms .	and
2	20955	Most of the non-combatants had already been evacuated from grafenthal .	There was still a large amount of support personnel .	but
2	100337	`` leave without my permission , '' .	He made the last word sound dirty , as if asking permission could have been so much fun .	but
2	70430	Lets not get our hopes up too much .	It could be them .	but
0	154878	He had found flora in a state of excitement which could arise only from some such terrible cause as had been mentioned by her brother .	Then he was , from an occurrence which certainly never could have entered into his calculations , asked to forego the bright dream of happiness which he had held so long and so rapturously to his heart .	and
2	20870	She believed he had something to offer her beyond sex .	He did n't . .	but
2	116582	I start the bike .	Cole just stands there .	but
0	33308	Jai wiped her tears with his thumb .	Pressed a kiss to her forehead .	and
3	65112	His face alone was enough of a deterrent .	Even she had decided to try something .	if
3	1242	He would never have solicited us .	He thought the maneuvers wholly unwise .	if
3	78928	You 'd have two minds-three .	You count lizzie-occupying the same body .	if
2	45702	Trying to look very clever and very approving and very calm , `` .	How long should i be out .	but
2	86047	They do nothing and pass the time gambling on human battles .	Wait for the end of the world .	but
0	80267	They were unwilling to give up the miller 's plan .	They turned to him for counsel .	and
4	120456	To be subject to the boring tedium of chores and miscellany .	Clearly you have such an amazing talent for working the wonders of god .	when
0	142245	Ashton leapt onto it .	Started stomping the lights out of the creatures head .	and
2	140675	She agreed with me .	There was nothing she could say .	but
4	78400	The big problem arose , pathed pru .	One of our organic units decided to stay here and transform into a creature of power that would ravage the earth .	when
1	144590	It was my fight not hers so she needed to stay the hell out of it and let me protect her .	She 'd made it mine .	because
3	149681	Once he sat back down with randy and i wondered .	He 'd heard me .	if
3	67772	She 'd slug me .	I woke her up for sex .	if
2	20529	My name is delilah .	Everyone calls me dee .	but
2	27145	Ranto had a spark of worry in his eyes , very faint .	His cool exterior began to crack .	but
4	128905	Yet seamus held back as if to give them time to get to know each other without raising any negative feelings with his presence .	Hed thought about this visit hed envisioned his father with them .	when
1	14322	I hated the word marriage .	It reminded me of a time that i wanted to bury and never speak of .	because
2	105513	Brought the issue regarding mr. roberts 's displeasure for socializing to her mother 's attention , complaining that her future would consist of few diversions if she were to marry him .	Her mother had simply pointed out that the only reason young ladies attended such events was with the direct purpose of drawing the attention of the gentlemen present .	but
2	2704	She had no idea what he meant .	When she shifted toward the barren land , a sight like nothing she could possibly have expected met her eyes .	but
0	107682	She was just ivy .	Her hand slipped to my waist , pulling a ribbon of feeling through me .	and
0	131529	Ammo , hunting blade and his cell phone went into his pants .	Then he put on the black windbreaker that was all he had , coat-wise .	and
0	5315	The weary-eyed tears were wiped .	The yawns were suppressed .	and
2	90387	I have the most beautiful outfit its crimson red , with gems along the bust yeah yeah , xander cuts her off mid-sentence .	She doesnt notice and walks back into the house .	but
0	108821	He accepted their words .	Followed aoife round the fire to sit near eogan .	and
2	135395	Me to talk or something .	All i do is smile and take another sip of my beer .	but
2	136828	To be such a happy thing .	After those men took you , my smiles went .	but
4	98609	So i will be able to guide you .	You are searching for our people .	when
0	110640	Without thinking , almost unaware that he was doing so , korhan knelt down at her feet .	Kissed her suede boot .	and
2	5583	`` his arrogance is legendary .	So is his cleverness .	but
3	38501	The years of fortune will only continue .	The gods are repaid their debt .	if
2	47377	He knew that his behaviour had been a cause for reproach .	He had never supposed that eda would think it her fault that he had pulled away from her all those years before .	but
0	42138	Whoever the unlucky human was would be at his house tonight for the wedding .	Mathias would soon know that .	and
3	38691	But they appear and or when we use our most powerful attacks , cross responds to his son .	Our lives are at stake .	if
2	50067	Cool and unruffled he spoke .	There was an underlying emotion that victoria could not identify .	but
0	93940	Tom slowed as he approached her ; she gazed intensely into his eyes , still humming the haunting melody of her song .	Saw lisa look up as if alerted by the sound of his footfalls .	and
4	96387	He could see that she had a pair of barber 's shears in one hand and a comb in the other .	Ted looked up in surprise .	when
0	70080	About the turn of the century , then they went , fixed her up , started shooting her off again once a year .	Got the old gun out of hiding .	and
0	18663	Britnee found a tin of cocoa in the kitchen , with craig 's help .	Set about making some for everyone .	and
3	70117	The landfill holds all our secrets .	They make it that .	if
4	115386	I was , my heart thrilled .	She leaned over me to fluff a pillow of animal fur under my head .	when
0	84714	Which seemed to emanate from .	Was thick enough to cut with a knife .	and
3	24402	More importantly , maybe they can help me take over my neighbour 's garden ? '' .	They imbue the power of hero 's .	if
4	47160	However izzian took his cue to faint .	The creature opened her mouth to speak .	when
2	63898	True , she seems to be the only succubus with a conscience and a specific strategy for finding her male meals .	She has a cute new apartment , a budding graphic design business , and the most unique friends shes ever had .	but
2	110991	The blue party has criticised art .	Never threatened to destroy it .	but
2	74278	Perhaps it was naught .	Her twin 's brothers coming in for a check - when the door swung open .	but
0	60495	I get off work so i can take you out on the town .	You 've got to go into work .	and
3	2127	I would understand , but you 're just mad because you think i lied to you . '' .	The demonic voodoo stuff gave you the heebie-jeebies .	if
2	155827	We 'd chat it up over coffee even though she 'd done nothing .	Treat her son like crap and tried to drive a wedge between the two of us .	but
0	79990	My overnight bag slid from my shoulder .	Out of habit , i tossed it toward my room .	and
2	156571	I closed my eyes .	Kept my head against hers .	but
2	82870	She reached for the envelope .	Yanked her hand back before she actually touched it .	but
4	118646	I would always catch one of their songs .	I turned on the radio on the way home from class .	when
0	55444	When you took a chance .	Walked out on the man who was hurting you .	and
0	96804	There will be a sea of blood .	There will be suffering .	and
2	52157	She instinctively flinched his hand carried on past as he reached for the shelves mounted on the wall behind her head .	His palm lunged toward her face and .	but
0	57081	The crisis was gone .	Nothing left but a little posing and haggling .	and
0	156513	She opened her eyes wide .	Flipped both hands toward her head .	and
0	56853	He was only one man .	Needed to stop carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders .	and
0	30007	Till then ... the hologram said .	Deactivated as the two blue squares on the music box faded to the silver metal surface .	and
2	128654	They were all somewhat drunk .	Were all experienced enough drinkers that they were able to turn their professional switches on .	but
4	71940	And , in the lobby , i told him i wanted to take you .	I ran into jase outside .	when
2	14438	Sally , blake began .	Then realized he had no idea what to say .	but
4	72187	I heard a familiar voice behind me .	I finished my most recent graffiti crime .	when
2	59186	Jeffrey tried to wait patiently and not interrupt .	Had always found himself unable to keep from blurting out important information when someone was on the phone .	but
2	113449	Dad might not be on my list of favorite people after banishing me to the nether regions of the state .	At least i was used to him .	but
0	54266	That hijacked her senses .	Took them on a joyride .	and
0	43712	Thunder returned a minute later with the rope .	Secured the irishmans hands behind his back .	and
1	35809	And i must be doing it .	There 's no doubt in my mind that cain is enjoying it .	because
3	33242	We 'd better hurry .	We 're going to find a new candidate .	if
2	88062	I knew that things were heating up between him and brandon 's contingent .	I was only supposed to be gone for one day .	but
0	59378	He set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly .	A pale green light came into his eyes .	and
2	158168	I told him to have a hearth to keep warm .	He only looks at me and ignores my suggestion .	but
2	27	He wasnt sure if it was some sort of armour or what .	When he looked in the mirror , he had a very decent , if fake , build .	but
0	14514	When i ran out of interesting things to say .	We 'd filmed every single classroom , trying to find cold spots or weird sounds or unexplained breezes and coming up empty .	and
0	100419	When hynek finally hauled open the door , the professor pushed past him .	Yelled for his friend .	and
2	106072	He had already thought it was the warner bros. cartoon , the one with foghorn leghorn .	He had to confirm that anyone else would reference that .	but
4	124272	They were worth a shit ton of money .	So they come back on the market , theyll be hotter than the fucking sun , and i 'll be a much , much richer man .	when
0	5908	Causing the demon to tut .	Jerk her across the threshold .	and
0	113352	This image is on all wise trees .	You shall know them by this sign .	and
3	25972	Ill kill all of you .	I have to , so dont think about running .	if
0	83593	Astonishingly her hands hesitated then ever so slowly , slipped beneath his robe to smooth over the tense muscles of his chest .	He prepared himself for her rejection , but .	and
4	148870	But , the fizzy feeling in her stomach had intensified .	She got to the end .	when
2	71054	They were warm and they werent the ones i had come to see .	Their noses were surprisingly velvety and once i got used to the smell it wasnt icky at all .	but
2	124564	Cambry heard this unspoken corollary in his head .	Paid it no mind .	but
0	68844	Feeling redoubled when richard clicked his parker pen .	Said , thats that .	and
1	57169	Then left me hanging on the cusp of an orgasm .	There were too many of will 's things in my condo .	because
2	159627	I am not sure if she really believes that i have traveled in time .	She loves me enough to at least fake that she does .	but
2	54173	Chattering voices drifted to his ears .	The words were spoken so quickly they reminded him of crickets chirping .	but
4	33379	Back in minneapolis for two weeks .	James got a call from her on the phone .	when
2	66557	Harley might consider him the enemy .	She was as helpless as he was to deny the smoldering attraction that crackled between them .	but
0	34391	It seemed the tears were finally beginning to become too much for her .	She turned away from darius to wipe them .	and
1	134541	They 're calling daisy a sex symbol in the media .	Just lily is a sex addict .	because
2	13779	The wall is all ice .	The castles are stone and wood .	but
2	157804	Having people know so much about her when she didnt know them made her feel vulnerable .	There was no way shed let anyone see it .	but
2	56258	Kylie had almost texted holiday and decided not to worry holiday any more on her wedding day .	Asked if she 'd heard from lucas .	but
0	63804	Patsy suddenly swung in front of her .	Stopped , forcing saber to do the same .	and
0	709	He handed me a gate pass and a parking pass .	Then waved me through .	and
1	75393	Nevertheless i went to see psyche that very evening as soon as the fox had set my mind at rest .	I had ( a little ) loved the queen .	because
4	139482	That had shouted out .	Lewis was all but beaten .	when
4	94099	He will be drawn towards him or her as the tide is drawn to the moon , naturally , unwittingly and .	A person meets their soul-twin .	when
0	6476	It was tight airless , and .	Dangling cobwebs brushed the childrens faces as they hurried through the darkness .	and
2	29740	The smell was stronger here and .	Coming from the bottom drawer of this bureau .	but
2	7893	All this he must do .	Right now he needed sleep .	but
0	82225	Mustove was far less impressed , but to see it actually happening was another matter mustove had believed in order and discipline .	Far more terrified he had seen the after images of the destruction .	and
4	132076	That just maybe they took a little more time tucking their children into bed or remembered to kiss their spouse with a little more meaning .	They left for work the next day .	when
2	62948	It was not enough to stop the blood flow .	It was stemming it .	but
0	144033	She glanced at the other cab , climbed into the back next to archie .	Then opened the door .	and
1	2003	Helen liked trying cases with ray .	He never pretended to like opposing counsel .	because
2	136288	The young man with the sword is known as the lord of the western sea-an obscure title , i 'll grant you . '' .	His people are an obscure sort of folk .	but
2	123681	It appeared to be a whole block over by jordan downs .	There were other single fires all over the city .	but
2	71989	It clawed at her arm , hissing in anger .	She continued to hold it close , stroking its fur and murmuring under her breath as the cat slowly calmed down .	but
3	120871	She needed help , in my opinion .	Varena needed three hours to get ready for a party .	if
0	51915	I simply lean my head .	Focus on wishing the pain .	and
4	7646	She slowly headed up another street , slipping their hand over her mouth silencing her muffled cry .	Someone grabbed her from .	when
0	86358	That is the warlord 's business .	He is ignoring things of that nature at the moment .	and
0	105090	The four briefcases had been filled with rocks .	Dropped deep underwater in the middle of one of the canals .	and
3	53437	She might get some shift work .	Even she were paid considerably less than a man .	if
2	12909	The sarge , who had lived inside bode 's head for so long , was silent and , even before the barn .	Had been for quite some time .	but
1	4073	I feel a little bit relieved .	It almost seems like melanie is worrying about me .	because
2	21225	Her patience and understanding with this whole screwed-up situation should make me happy .	They have the opposite effect .	but
0	129771	To the rest of riktenburg we were still criminals .	Fuchs would now be sure to hunt us .	and
3	64323	Then you know you should not challenge me .	You know about my powers .	if
2	4879	They were busy killing each other , and drowned every single enemy on that slope . '' .	Then a solid wall of water came out of the ground .	but
2	109813	It seemed a little far-fetched to me .	It was at least worth a look considering it was the only lead we had .	but
4	138080	I was about to shove him out of the way .	He clasped both of his hands on my shoulders and roughly shoved me against the wall .	when
3	154574	Well , i may have gotten between her knees . '' .	You know what i mean .	if
4	82993	They stood against the rail and looked down at the wreckage of the hotel lobby .	They reached the top floor .	when
2	132281	This was going to hurt her .	He had to say it .	but
2	9014	My body shook as i sobbed there in the kitchen .	It was only a second or two before i felt lucas strong arms wrap around my shoulders .	but
0	23870	Crawling up towards the weapons hilt .	Swimming through the vicious fluid clinging to the steel .	and
2	143505	She dropped it off and i cut her off at the pass . '' .	Tried to grill me with questions .	but
2	32810	I had been prepared for him to try a little harder .	He was changing the subject .	but
4	127175	There was no use tryin ' to avoid noah .	I knew his next move was to locate me and let me have it .	when
3	151156	In crimland id get hauled off by a few people that were looking for me .	I spent even a full day .	if
0	9635	I looked at them instead of beck 's face . '' .	Whispered , `` i 'm sorry .	and
0	6154	They 'd confined shifters .	Controlled them with the collars .	and
2	140199	He 's out there waiting .	I seemed to not want to move out of my bedroom .	but
3	100839	Ianna wasnt jealous of the effectthe women who wore them ended up looking like men .	They were flat-chested , or as brazen as seviade cotar if they were .	if
2	32774	I have eyes out at the major ports . '' .	It 'll take time to find them .	but
2	143130	The wave of grief came upon me suddenly and my posture must have showed signs of fatigue because simon asked , `` need a break , sweetheart ? '' .	I tried hard to suppress it .	but
4	77798	He was halfway down the corridor .	Barbara caught up with him , and managed to drag him back to their room , fighting and shouting .	when
2	146941	Of course , this was not true in the slightest .	He thought it better to lie than tell the truth .	but
0	138790	Sitting back on the couch at aces direction .	Putting his head between his knees so he didnt pass out or throw up .	and
0	90487	The horses stopped with verdins appearance .	Drew close together that the companions might converse .	and
0	84215	After another silent glance , she turned away , soon disappearing from view .	Rushed down the pass .	and
2	94012	Once the chimney was found we were able to locate a small hole in what seemed to be a man-made chamber .	The inside had been filled with all sorts of things , including earth , some skeletons of both animal and human , pottery , and other remnants .	but
2	65071	They were both silent .	The professor started and quivered .	but
2	98641	Cars were parked along the road .	There was no way we were missing the launch .	but
4	14045	Mention if you would that he will owe me another thirty thousand dragons come the black of the moon .	You speak to king stannis .	when
2	123546	He makes a mint off that game he programmed .	He gets off on this sleuth stuff .	but
0	74654	A few minutes later , the chief waved as the president drove .	He was very happy that the visit had gone .	and
4	121296	That had been inside the deathbag .	He cut it open , gave off a faint , chilling echo of the deathbag 's final scream .	when
0	127679	He was the newest guy on alejo 's team .	Had been sent over from puerto rico .	and
4	43976	I had gone only a few feet .	I saw jessica sitting on a stone bench .	when
3	139011	`` i told you , i 'd kill you . '' .	I ever saw you .	if
3	76709	I have no doubt .	Especially the child is male .	if
4	137190	You pushed me away from your life .	I followed you in the parking lot right after you returned from walsh city .	when
2	66378	Now , i apologize for sounding rude .	I must see to my morning nap .	but
2	30121	After talking at length with her , i encouraged her to reschedule the ceremony .	She stressed that the date she had chosen was a tentative one only , and that she would confirm the arrangement closer to the day .	but
2	37858	I had to hold my head up long enough to let her sit down .	Then i felt utter relief as i put my head in her lap .	but
2	46029	I would have had to drop the items in my hand to stop the ball before my chest did .	I 'd agonized over my selections , taking a speed ball to the chest was the only option .	but
3	79274	Then we 'll only have the added benefit of having gotten to know each other better .	We 're still interested in each other .	if
0	44428	Well , thats done , sara said .	We have no time to cry over something that hasnt happened .	and
2	83965	Cigan doesnt even say a word .	Sees the case of elma who dies of sleeplessness .	but
0	78909	Ira cocked his head a little . '' .	Then said , `` it 's too late .	and
2	72089	The other was clear and nothing else was normal because there was no sign of his friend in those eyes , none .	The pupil appeared to be normal .	but
4	88542	No desire to see the horror and disgust enter her eyes .	She learned what he 'd done fifty years .	when
2	32362	We spent al day with no luck .	Neither of us minded .	but
3	119059	I 'd hate to see what you call bad news . '' .	Almost getting killed is your idea of catching a break .	if
0	2856	Walking toward the door .	Darted down the hall .	and
3	121281	It probably baffles him capable of any form of awareness .	He is capable of perception at this point .	if
3	22724	Wed never finish a bottle of wine , fr .	All the faithful did that .	if
0	92605	He belted down another quick slug .	Wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his flannel shirt .	and
2	156519	She starts toward me .	She reaches me , she stops , dragging the stethoscope from around her neck .	but
3	109547	It would be so much easier to explain .	It happened only in his mind .	if
2	55214	Dad might not always be the best father .	I 'm just as awful at being a daughter .	but
2	158979	Neither army is actually massive . ' .	In combination they 're serious enough to threaten the holy city .	but
0	27617	They all hastily followed suit .	I waved them down .	and
4	51063	However , she had laughed at his fears .	He had tried to point that out .	when
2	141429	We 'd discussed getting dressed up like everyone .	Decided to go for comfort .	but
2	103403	Not surprisingly the launch was ragged , uncertain , and for a long second i flickered between the real world and the other .	Finally the color glow stabilized and deepened .	but
4	33015	I pull the tuition receipt from my purse , ready to plead my case .	She looks up at me with something akin to shock on her face .	when
4	146223	Tommy waved sandy to them .	The other two ladies stopped in front of him .	when
0	157301	Valerie opened her eyes , while lying on her back and looking into the bright ceiling lights in the bio lab on sanctuary ; the biosynth space station .	Took her very first breath at the same moment .	and
0	99117	Detroit adjusted the sound until it was just loud enough to hear .	We crowded around to watch .	and
4	1129	The first thing i noticed was gold lame underpants .	The tear-away pants came off .	when
2	142212	Rumor is he 's spent his term tryin ' to clean up the club , with some success .	Clean for those boys does not have the same definition as it does for the rest of the population .	but
1	19147	To wear the sexy red see-through thong .	It turned him on knowing luis would be walking around that way in front of all those people and only jase would know it .	because
2	107162	They could stay where they were .	It was hardly ideal .	but
2	39238	I should probably be pissed .	I have places to go .	but
4	21332	The pain came from so deep within her that judith thought it was going to tear her in two .	She re-told this to alex months .	when
1	71505	What if they thought he was attracting dark mages .	He was a dark mage in the making .	because
3	87625	They recognize the danger to their shores .	It becomes known the powder of immortality is hidden .	if
3	154969	Well then i declare the night will be a great success ! '' .	The rest of the dishes at the dinner are as good as these cookies .	if
4	88368	Hinev forgot to breathe for a moment .	He examined the results .	when
0	87782	I flip to the lightning setting pull the trigger .	Turn toward where i think the crossbow sound came from .	and
2	76643	She doesnt wait for a response .	Promptly rejoins us and puts her hands to ours .	but
4	101295	`` , she took me to the er .	I started throwing up and ran a temp of about one-oh-four .	when
1	60603	His tips have been shit .	All he does is bark at everyone .	because
2	68442	It 's almost comical to watch her unease turn to that frustrated kind of anger she has perfected over time .	Before she can do more than open her mouth and take a deep breath , jazz interrupts her .	but
2	129338	Finally , he said , `` i 'll see what i can do to buy you some time . '' .	You need to watch your ass around volos .	but
0	33068	Now he was a quivering mass of nausea , with a raging headache .	He felt weaker than shit .	and
3	44513	I can prepare some mezedes .	You 're hungry , or ... '' `` no , thank you .	if
0	62687	Fixing up the tie around his neck .	Checking his reflection in the small mirror hanging inside on the door of the armoire .	and
2	74695	Sandra seemed pretty busy , she was gon na introduce us .	Then other couple arrived .	but
2	35007	It would be unfair to take seriously the things the man had said immediately before his seizure , no doubt .	There was enough without that .	but
0	10773	She had a short bob of glossy black hair her features had an asian flavor to them-porcelain skin , expressive eyes , delicate cheekbones .	Held back with a headband .	and
3	46354	Just call me sandra .	That makes you uncomfortable .	if
4	19533	I cover my face and continue to cry-cry for all i 've lost in the past few months .	He removes the tip .	when
0	56059	Two men and a woman went .	He ran through the hole they left .	and
3	20531	And , no more mr. nice guy .	You ever come back to this campus .	if
4	157856	I 'd gotten halfway to my feet , managed to grab my hair .	The were , quicker than the humans .	when
2	79796	Prashkin is clean in america .	Was indicted in mexico on fraud charges that were dropped quickly three weeks after they were brought .	but
2	42874	You must do as you think best to inform your people of the tragedy .	I must emphasize , in a pacific manner .	but
2	62564	As i lay there , all totally ignored , i called maria over and had her make arrangements for caroline and cindy to be flown over and accommodated close to davids hospital .	Airspeed , flat out in other words , preparations were being made for two patients to be offloaded at jfk , and .	but
4	94960	It feels the same .	We were in the bayou .	when
2	7433	It burned his insides as it went .	The heat was pleasant , and it made him forget how hungry he was for something more than organic beet extracts and small , genetically sound chicken breasts .	but
3	539	Franklin 's shadowy enemies had murdered this indian chief-and .	The symbol on the page was more than coincidence , possibly it was the same enemy against whom sigma had been battling for years .	if
4	42096	`` i love you too , '' she murmured .	They finally came up for air .	when
4	148998	The messages started the morning after the article went live and ended only a couple minutes .	He had been trying to figure out where she was .	when
0	58647	When you woke up on a winter 's morning .	Knew , by the light , that it had snowed .	and
1	32733	Soji knew when they entered kersk .	She could see mountains in the distance that bordered sinhalien and churchik lands .	because
2	75490	They had been in one of the barges that had been captured .	Had succeeded in escaping by the simple expedient of walking into the woods after dark .	but
4	12411	How old were you ? '' .	You started your company .	when
0	142088	Mr. marlowe realizes the truth .	It 's as if he somehow shrinks into himself .	and
4	31727	There 're four of them milling around this old beat up studebaker that has the bumpers held on with baling wire .	I throw the door .	when
2	117884	My insides were shaking .	I knew i handled that .	but
2	64318	Actually i fell out .	Fortunately no one witnessed the embarrassing fall .	but
4	148155	Nadia , call me . '' .	You 're talking sense .	when
2	133694	Then the mouse found a route down the back of her clothing and .	Burrowed its way between her shoulder blades .	but
2	51307	Merlots mind hung there a while in wonder .	He was brought back to warm reality by a familiar picture , an inquisitive coquettish look with a captivating sagacious smile offering him a glass of champagne .	but
2	15478	Deciding to take the responsibility of being the driver for the night , which may not seem like a big thing .	In my case , it drastically altered my life .	but
2	74667	They are not going to kill her .	Silence has to be involved in this .	but
2	66955	`` seamus called kelsey and . '' .	Said they were trapped at the venetian and that they needed help .	but
1	119514	Josh , you have no school pictures .	You didnt go to school until you were twelve .	because
2	61161	It hurts me to tell you this .	You 're goin ' to go live with uncle colt and aunt van for a while .	but
0	81776	The eagles claw was considered a hallowed place by the mojave people .	Was named as such because of an earlier peoples presence here , the fexuit .	and
2	16594	Most likely i should 've had a checkup before we left .	I intended to have doc check me out when we hit lachion .	but
2	30846	It was of great value .	That was probably a lie too , like his name and even his face .	but
4	91498	Her smile was huge and genuine and world-eating .	Baby turned to me .	when
0	72519	Although female , she fought extremely wel .	Deserved her title of sergeant .	and
2	31564	He raised the bottle to his lips .	Stopped short of drinking .	but
3	9908	And this , i had thought before , might very easily come .	The men of glome had no will to be ruled by a woman .	if
0	96899	He seemed to collapse into himself .	Where a man once stood , there was only a raven .	and
3	28994	How awful it would be .	She could never again catch the scent of rain in the air , or dance in the silvery light of a full moon .	if
2	51109	No amount of lung power would reach any other person in any other silo .	Might , if he were stupid enough to actually try it , get him noticed by someone in his own silo .	but
0	118426	But then the man stepped into view .	All of my concentration shattered .	and
0	35270	After a few moments , he leans to one side , `` say , do you know if this is david shea 's place ? '' .	Asks the guy on the stool next to him .	and
2	42992	She made a halfhearted attempt .	The ball only rolled three-quarters of the way back to me .	but
2	159433	She did receive an allowance .	That was determined by jason and not a standard amount set forth in her father 's will .	but
0	127920	That holds the marble altar .	Watch the temple worker enter and exit the catacombs .	and
0	36357	The black threads were gone the coils were relaxing .	Her hair was still red , but .	and
4	58974	But they packed up .	Things got really bad .	when
4	60747	She scrounged around until she located a cardboard box , then swiftly cleaned out her desk , depositing all her personal items in the carton .	She reached her office in the high-rise office building that housed many such firms .	when
2	15817	Nate returned to an upright position .	Kept his back against the wall .	but
0	159495	Lily cocked her head , considering . '' .	Said , `` i suppose we should like them to fall inwards : stand back , all of you , if you please .	and
0	85841	He sensed a mutual affinity .	Even liked the shaman .	and
3	148941	What difference does it make .	Even i am immune .	if
4	152814	He leaned into her and kissed the join of her legs .	Elliot slid her drawers from her .	when
2	11731	I was ready to lay down big bucks for an antebellum home near the battlefield .	You swore it was haunted .	but
3	31952	And just what the hell would have happened .	You would have fallen through the floor or something .	if
0	13824	He fumbled in his pocket , spilling a few as he fumbled with the lid .	Produced his little green box of dried frog pills .	and
0	124262	Grabbing two aprons , she handed one to him .	Tied the other around her waist .	and
3	127831	He did not care ; they must ride as they had never ridden before .	The whole castle saw them .	if
2	6361	To kill the demi-fae .	To capture them for the valg princes to haul back to adarlan .	but
0	110630	His excellency is an honored guest .	His homeworld would love to do this for him .	and
2	55152	Figuring he might be needed to protect piper from flying objects , brady stayed .	He really wanted to make off with the baby like shelby was doing .	but
0	87317	I had drawn jack into my web of crazy .	Then just when i 'd had him in my trap , i 'd chased him out of town .	and
4	35508	And she felt peaceful , which was a state of being the vampires had stolen from her that long-ago nightmarish day .	She was with him .	when
2	136859	He flashed a quick grin .	His eyes were troubled .	but
0	393	I raised it up .	Abeloec 's lips touched the rim .	and
4	1136	The pool boys brought us towels was like , never , but we loved the attention .	We got too warm or too coldwhich .	when
4	33732	He was still suckling a breast .	She gently moved a hand up and down his erection .	when
3	82793	Then she had to be an imposter .	These people actually claimed to have met the heir to the throne .	if
4	82353	Look at liam worriedly and shake my head .	He takes my hand , leading me to the iced river .	when
2	63271	Help , i tried to say .	Again , no sound emerged .	but
3	85048	`` , '' laurence said , `` there must be consideration for its care . '' .	There is a child .	if
0	81071	Nomi looked at the strange slender automaton .	Had a smile on her face .	and
0	73953	It stood at least ten feet tall .	Was made of brass .	and
4	67064	The first set was even at three-all , and ripped a backhand winner up the line off a 2nd serve .	Pete got his first break point opportunity .	when
2	94201	Tension bracketed his eyes .	It was aroused tension .	but
2	122129	It seems like a waste of fuel to me .	I guess the saudis dont have to worry about that .	but
3	135910	Their views will be dismissed because , you know , everyone has seen the tv .	Someone says there were no planes .	if
0	74071	Well , it was a little touch .	Go there for a while .	and
1	157984	Going to be livid if they have to send in another ship and crew .	We cant gather our most important data .	because
2	52546	`` i would hate to risk a cave-in , '' tark said , `` . '' .	It might be our only choice .	but
0	136463	To stop your bike or car over these boxes and release the brakes .	Turn off the engine .	and
3	48734	He looked at her intently , not sure , but sure it would bring her back to her senses .	Censure was what she needed .	if
2	12419	Her mom has taken her all this time .	She had to pick up a second job just so they could afford miracle 's medical bills from the last two months .	but
0	95487	I know your weaknesses .	I know that the second any one of us are compromised , you 'll jump into the line of fire to save us .	and
0	145219	Aria looks at jason .	Declares , it 's starting .	and
3	120350	I 'm telling ya i better not have a chance in hell of running into that piece of shit ! '' .	I decide to do this .	if
1	75635	You want me to leave .	You think i 'm putting your family in danger .	because
2	38667	The men over there are nadraks .	The only one who might give you any trouble is tarlek .	but
3	136227	Suzy would probably choke him within an inch of his life .	She knew that he had almost spilled on their sex life .	if
3	122376	Just how thrilled would you be .	He did the same to me .	if
2	49051	I know this is all difficult for you .	If you need to talk , i 'm .	but
4	103948	Reeked of coffee and cigarette smoke .	He shook her hand and passed a container of coffee in her direction .	when
2	74431	There were some single females he worked closely with .	None of them fancied marcelo .	but
0	38929	I heard a soft whistling sound .	Turned in time to catch bodo trying to imitate it .	and
3	147819	However , she would have gladly turned over her trust fund to save the family ship from sinking .	She had known the specifics .	if
2	32002	I hoped he had his tail between his legs and you can never be too careful .	Was headed home to greet his sweet , loving wife .	but
4	49424	She was staring at his jaw .	She said the words .	when
0	104393	After that , mary thanked him for his help .	Suggested that he rest until dinner .	and
0	63488	Agnes saw igor 's retreating back pause for a moment .	She expected him to say something .	and
0	11665	Where she might find one , cassandra leaned in whispered she knew someone who had a small horde of them .	About tuning forks and .	and
0	60793	Murphy seemed to think he 'd succeeded . '' .	Look at how sloppy he was .	and
4	112033	A flustered mrs. barndale had just left a meeting .	Her cell phone rang .	when
0	127480	`` it 's not dating exactly , '' mabel assured her .	When elvi peered at her with open disbelief , she continued , `` look , tons of men responded to the ad .	and
0	30256	She grabbed gisbos hand gave a kick to his backside , shuffling him .	Thrust a ring on it .	and
0	48597	She stared into her cup ? '' .	Athol asked , `` why did you come here before .	and
3	155713	May i ask , miss harleth .	You are tired of dancing .	if
2	30056	I only have a few minutes .	I need to make a confession , lexi .	but
0	16469	Zacharel returned to the room .	Materialized in front of the human male .	and
2	124374	The problem was not her clothes .	That he could not stop imagining her without them .	but
0	92810	The ground comes up .	Instinctively i know this is going to hurt .	and
0	122720	Why dont you get some vittles .	Take an early night .	and
4	2972	She emerged onto the deck to find dark , open ocean around them .	They were at last allowed out of the galley .	when
4	134317	The rage builds and i yell at him , `` ? '' .	Did she cut her first tooth , jace .	when
0	52159	Talon sidestepped his charge , catching the man in the back of his neck .	Brought his freed sword around in a backward stroke .	and
4	140911	Coming up with it .	I knew and had to acknowledge that i hadnt been trying to come up with anything .	when
1	18145	She sees past the disguises of this world .	She is the last descendant of david 's .	because
0	61195	Sorry i missed your call-i was in the water , '' he went on , walking toward me .	The smile on his face faltered .	and
1	145661	`` , '' he says , his voice begging me to understand-to not be angry with him .	I want you to be human .	because
3	28566	Then he wouldnt be put to the test .	Only those kelpies would sink all the boats .	if
0	160570	The vampire 's head rolled to one side .	His body stopped moving .	and
3	59925	`` , i can certainly comply . '' .	You want possessive alpha male .	if
0	19767	Her would make this whole search and rescue a lot easier .	Let me get on with my human life .	and
0	3726	A day she 'd emerged from the opera theater .	Watched max walk away , a small package arrived for victoria .	and
3	41005	They are long gone , and i was right to think that she was hurt and angry that matthew hadnt considered her in his plans for the family .	Miss nancy ever did have romantic feelings for malcolm samuels .	if
3	133962	It 'd serve seth right .	She did accept warren 's proposal .	if
0	128989	To climb into my basic little car , drive along quiet winding roads .	Let my mind be .	and
0	71322	He guided himself down low .	Thrust against her opening .	and
4	27384	She suppressed a giggle .	She saw my attire .	when
4	20649	I was acutely physically aware of her .	She brushed past me , her sinuous movements as she spun the wheel or hung over the rails .	when
3	26656	I 'd tap your shoulders and send you off with my blessings . '' .	I had a sword .	if
2	76124	It was a cute little baby .	It couldnt be sallys baby .	but
1	107956	The only reason he yet lived was .	Bradley still clung to the weapon .	because
1	70044	One day he 'll be kicked out of the bar .	I 'll bet he cheats .	because
4	98840	The air was getting colder .	I was awoken by the voice of maria as she called my name .	when
2	9426	Buildings glided past her .	She could not see a single schon .	but
2	71139	Feeling like i was abandoning my mother for loving him .	Then remembering that she loved him .	but
3	103745	It should , eventually , work for mairi tanner .	It worked for him .	if
2	42981	Danica watched blake for signs of attraction toward kaylie .	His eyes were heavy as he focused on his plate .	but
2	22538	It was a turning point .	Maybe i was just deluding myself .	but
3	32430	Maybe tangling with one thats a bad guy , she used air quotes , driving my eyebrows up almost to my bangs , you need to take a drink of a persephone .	You ever get a chance you know .	if
4	136163	My best time to go out and be camouflaged is .	The aspens are turning and dropping leaves .	when
3	9852	Maybe it wouldve been better for him .	He hadnt made it .	if
0	76237	Between them , the legionnaires lifted him from the ground .	Carried him at full stride to the momentary sanctuary .	and
2	130124	You told all of us some of that , susannah thought , and warned eddie with her eyes to do the same .	Kept her mouth shut .	but
2	104425	He stepped back and away from josie and ash , telling him to make sure mia and bethany were safe .	Ash could hear him talking to jace .	but
0	32250	Hefting a pile of hardbound ledgers .	Handing them to joel .	and
2	57309	Which was both good and the pain was also returning .	Bad-words were less slippery .	but
0	46006	They had hair , like herself , ranging from star-white to void-black .	Seemed to insist on covering their bodies with great drapes of cloth .	and
2	131790	He reached for her .	She stepped back , bumping into one of the long succession-tables .	but
0	103339	He cocked his head to the side .	Gently pushed back my hair .	and
0	152128	We must go back into the past .	Bring him into the present .	and
2	27772	About five families could have fit into the anderson home .	It housed only two people now-david and carolyn .	but
0	61049	Ahkmenotep , i hear your words in my mind .	I know what the covens must think .	and
3	154072	My soon-to-be-ex boss would not mind .	She was a half an hour late , or three hours late , due to the fact she was seeing to me .	if
0	68084	I picked up the book .	Read from the passage .	and
2	84485	I d always thought nicholas was bad .	He definitely was the more tolerable of the faerie breed .	but
3	117127	Jack once again asked him .	He might buy a turn at the spoon .	if
0	22052	They did , at least as long as it has taken me to explain about the white dragon .	By that time the whole of him , white with green eyes , and leaking green fire at every joint , and snorting black smoke like a steamer , had come out of the cave .	and
4	109998	At long last open his eyes , he looked down at elana and wanted to laugh .	He could finally breathe .	when
2	137868	In that case he would crash into the earth with enough speed to break lots of bones and crush lots of organs .	The speed would not be fast enough to kill him .	but
4	19880	They 'd only been together a week .	She realized she 'd made a serious mistake by getting intimately involved with him .	when
2	134677	Neomi felt dwarfed ; x had introduced her as `` neomi , the mortal . '' .	They seemed to be making every attempt not to startle her , especially since nandiuml .	but
3	155874	Is , it 'll give you that chance to make your approach .	I make things sound drastic .	if
0	78374	Myrel looked at the crate , but she needed an accomplice .	Knew how she could get out of the prison unnoticed .	and
3	131447	This was something she could fix .	She could just ride this horse .	if
3	88171	I 've got some bad news for him .	That 's the case .	if
0	41661	When his dinner had all been shoved into his mouth .	Dragged down his throat .	and
1	152021	Alexander didnt have time for the next thought .	Gutierrez slammed into him with the full force of his 180 pounds .	because
0	114180	How gerrod had taken her blood .	She had experienced gerrod 's frequency .	and
0	98880	He thought about the young blind girl .	How he might be able to help her .	and
0	50961	Preston 's head hung .	He stared at the floor .	and
0	111477	Skull hurriedly took hold of sofias hand .	Lifted herself out the cleft .	and
4	2727	To break it up .	Dannys books were getting kicked around .	when
2	129806	All along i have been let down by fools , have you any idea how difficult it is , knowing exactly what needs to be done .	Having to depend on brain-dead morons to carry things out .	but
2	60385	He considered catching her hand , stopping her from unmasking him .	A part of him wanted terri to see his face .	but
0	157513	Just now you rush over . '' .	Have the gall to ask if i 'm alright .	and
3	93443	They would use 2500 litres .	The storm lasted ten hours .	if
2	13373	You need to do what 's best for you . '' .	Remember that the needs of the many overpower the needs of the few .	but
0	26113	She still had hold of his arms .	He was rubbing her .	and
4	121635	Had even broken her arm in a fit of rage .	She was just eight .	when
2	58127	Rachel pulled her sweater across her body and her insides churned with guilt and conflict .	Forced herself not to look back at him again as she , jax , and josh started toward the office .	but
3	37515	Channing led them first through the roman catacombs , then through a long modern tunnel that housed .	The steel tracks were any indication , a rail trol ey of some kind .	if
0	134065	Archer may be an origin , but he cares about her , daemon .	He 's still a good guy .	and
0	39908	There simon is held in a luxurious prison by jailers who are as beautiful as they are deadly .	Their courage will be tested to the breaking point .	and
2	41840	I was still sitting with nash .	He was sprawled backward , leaning up against the rock , and one of his legs was under mine and we were sort of tangled up in each other .	but
4	110122	Sent home for the night .	That pathetic little lepus is tucked away in bed .	when
0	146294	Seth plopped himself down on her desk chair , before setting his feet down on the floor and stopping himself so he faced the girls .	Spun it around in a circle .	and
0	141027	She quickly reached up .	Switched her headlamp off .	and
4	95123	The toilet seat warms up .	So you get up in the middle of the night you wont freeze your butt off .	when
0	78943	It flew over the courtyard .	Saw the sheriff frantically waving it .	and
3	3197	She could keep her on the line .	Darla could get her off topic .	if
3	27455	She would 've gotten taller .	Ali were still alive .	if
2	141578	I 'd noticed , and ... slowly and painfully , if possible .	I wanted nothing more than to watch the bastard die .	but
1	54214	There was one thing he 'd never be able to do .	Good god it was learn .	because
0	78824	They 're all more or less tame .	It 's not polite to frighten the neighbors .	and
2	80237	Andra tried to call out a warning .	Her breath was stuck in her chest , so she did the only thing she could do .	but
0	20397	Up-then shuddered once , abruptly overwhelmed with exhaustion .	Slumped in his arms .	and
0	100732	What , leave this one with me .	Ill do some further tests .	and
1	87491	He was forced to abide by social guidelines , which seemed like shifting lines drawn in the sand , unjust , yet just as binding as a legal agreement .	His current predicament held no legal implications .	because
2	59824	At least that would give me a chance to become less terrified and possibly even relax - yeah , i know , fat chance .	It was worth a shot .	but
0	101885	Hand over hand , he moved laterally on this limb .	Then dropped to grab another .	and
0	70073	He threw the scooter off to the side of the road .	Started to hitch-hike the rest of the way .	and
3	146838	The quest would be called off , and his father would be as good as dead .	He denied he was the warrior .	if
2	57064	Theni tried calling him all weekend , and .	He wouldnt pick up his phone .	but
4	70728	What he 's like .	He gets like this , but i do .	when
2	60866	Three of the bashers should be able to handle it .	They decided to head that way with the rest of the team , and two bashers and two javelins in the hold .	but
0	21697	Then , as one , they turned .	Set off to confront whatever the fates had in store for them .	and
0	108647	We had a good vantage point of the tchindi .	The path willie would take .	and
4	57470	Away and , his eyes were brimming with pain .	He returned his gaze to her .	when
2	145371	It 's been weeks since i 've played .	My fingers find the strings as if they were made to be .	but
3	30779	Bear children and struggle with spacing them and feeding them , you may struggle .	You become a mother .	if
4	39556	To call kim again in 1987 .	The eighth day had ran its course .	when
2	126248	He told me nothing of the truth of who he was , of course .	He must have seen something .	but
2	149790	Excuse me , sir .	Dispatches have arrived from both colonel taylor and lieutenant governor philips .	but
2	87404	All were busy with their mornings .	Otherwise they all were .	but
2	22921	The older woman had to hustle .	She managed to poke frankie in the back as she passed .	but
4	16404	`` back , we had seven lawyers .	We got federal money .	when
2	24004	Once they finished dinner , blake offered desert and coffee .	Mckenzie knew she really should get home and get back to work .	but
2	38119	The lights in the big house were all .	There were a few still on in the guesthouse .	but
0	101072	Charity shook her head .	Said , `` it 's a dog bred by the soviet union in the caucasus mountains for use in secured military installations .	and
2	130990	I tried to extend my haven awareness all the way to my room .	It was out my range to directly reach from the training room we were in as i 'm sure that master jason had known before giving me the task .	but
4	135837	Your queen gave this necklace to me . '' .	She left for wendlyn .	when
0	66942	He put his hands behind his head as a cushion .	Wondered what the beak would give him .	and
1	16614	When i think about it .	I was also built from delusional optimism and folly .	because
2	68627	I 'll let her know we 're dating .	Maybe i should ease her into the engagement .	but
1	97688	Bullshit , bullshit , bullshit , but i think thats why i didnt bother going .	I felt that i got it and didnt need the lectures .	because
2	115939	I went to the other side and he jerked them out of my hands .	Tried to help him .	but
0	150437	Eli eyed me as if that whole story was another way of telling me not to trust alec .	I shuddered at the thought of eli hobnobbing with other vamps in the basement for hundreds of years while he was one of them .	and
0	26622	Mostly i ignore dad .	Stay away from him .	and
2	46729	Thank heaven he wasnt killed .	He had permanently lost partial use of his legs .	but
2	33562	She repeated the words .	There was no enthusiasm .	but
3	34602	Mike would betray us , in fact i was almost certain he had been threatened into doing .	He had the chance .	if
0	127158	Gilla slammed her book closed .	Announced that she was going to accompany joyah since she had had a recent concussion .	and
2	151147	I was not particularly into girlish things like dolls .	These two were unique .	but
0	149837	Anxiety pressed against her chest .	She looked at her shaky hand .	and
4	57425	Pressure definitely bothers me .	I sit down for a test .	when
0	148258	The spear fell from the wounded fae .	Clattered on the pavement .	and
0	7423	They were humming both visually and audibly like a beacon .	He tried to wipe them .	and
4	31381	He saw bleak understanding .	Reichen looked up into the warrior 's face .	when
0	32443	She jerked her hands .	Ragnar stepped around her and followed keita .	and
1	59983	His shoulder hitting the door and pushing it in .	He bends down and reaches in to go after it .	because
0	119916	The rocks were also slippery .	Climbing them under the best of circumstances was dangerous enough , without adding the bonus obstacle of rushing .	and
0	78449	She gripped the bedclothes .	Replayed in her mind the way her friend spoke .	and
3	124662	I put the entire belador tribe in conflict with viper .	I challenge the tribunal 's ruling against brina .	if
4	104876	Taro was only halfway through his pack of swisher sweet cigarettes .	His solitude was disturbed by a frowning man .	when
0	13543	All three of them were looking down .	I started to breathe easier .	and
4	108181	As bowe grappled against the weight , he jerked in surprise .	The instinct rang inside his head , strong and clear .	when
3	101645	To prom as your date .	It 'd be you took your brother . '' .	if
2	88972	I stood there for a while .	Then thought lets just do this .	but
0	134114	Sun got a handful of hair .	Pulled with surprising strength .	and
4	119653	And then the time had come .	The viceroy had presented malkom a slave to drink - one unlike all the others he 'd offered , one more valuable than the rest .	when
3	25639	He is going to make our lives even more miserable .	I start causing trouble .	if
2	108831	It left during the ride in the truck .	Now it 's returned .	but
0	85365	My control was slipping .	Now it was only a matter of time before the giant killed me .	and
2	130108	Your pupils and i have decided to stop off in cyprus on the way home for a few days rest and recreation at the seaside .	Well be back on friday , and your lessons will almost be back to normal .	but
2	15725	I nearly killed it when i fell off the roof and landed in the middle of it .	It was tougher than it looked .	but
4	39792	His twin bent courteously to hear what the blonde was saying , and guy 's eyes narrowed .	Her slim hand pushed a pair of designer sunglasses to the top of her head .	when
3	142151	I 'm obliged to care for him .	My lord is unwell .	if
2	103959	She wanted to scream .	In the deepest corner of her heart , all she knew was a selfish , swamping relief that andreas was still breathing .	but
2	15944	With the fire now at bay , and the air breathable again , and his back no longer burning , far sounded a lot like near to him , and .	Feeling laras grip on his hand firm up , he took off .	but
4	1295	That 's . '' .	The shuttle is supposed to be .	when
2	80350	Addison 's eyes glistened , remembering her .	Just as quickly went .	but
0	82719	Abruptly the flickering abated .	Daniel thought he sensed an increase in the beings luster .	and
2	27651	They seemed like they wanted to pat him .	His stare kept them by the doors .	but
2	123668	The small , square room was much darker than .	The lenses on my mask adjusted .	but
2	67802	'' he said , `` . '' .	It 's not a clue - just mr tiny - being smug .	but
1	97180	Cain must have thought the same thing .	He lunged for the cop .	because
2	119713	Edward approached the door to open it .	Guillem stopped him before he did it .	but
4	72869	Janet and hunter quietly chatted about a few things .	Betty suddenly sat up .	when
4	124012	She bit the words .	She saw the gleam of hopeful forgiveness shining in his eyes .	when
3	95831	`` ... '' `` you can sue .	I find out you 've played me .	if
3	90085	Kaldar would try to slit his throat .	He stepped an inch out of line .	if
4	19276	He 's so bleeding thoughtful .	Even he 's being frustrating .	when
2	45387	`` ugh , '' i remarked .	Scooped up eggs and fruit and grabbed a drink box of blood .	but
2	45912	Expecting images of palm trees and sun drenched beaches to pop up .	Instead the site had pictures of bars and scantily clad people stood around drinking .	but
3	155544	The protectors of the vampires , then he must have denounced his position as a venator .	He had joined the tutela .	if
3	71018	This was as nice a prison as she could have asked for .	Kira was to be held against her will .	if
4	85606	She saw a big wooden board had been positioned to block the entrance .	They got to the old shed .	when
2	100850	His eyes were hidden behind a pair of opaque sunglasses .	Even they seemed to glow .	but
2	69181	Vlad sneered , obviously knowledgeable of some french .	Then this was canada .	but
4	79695	Take your positions and dont make any noise until halos group surrounds .	We get to the school .	when
1	135251	No matter how well you do , your boss will look forward to the day you 're gone .	Just he hates your training and some of your long-dead failed colleagues .	because
2	109598	It was not eight years was such a long time .	It was two fifths of the lifetime of a twenty-year-old and his life since leaving billibotton had been so different that all before it had faded like a misty dream .	but
3	5342	But , how can there be fateand dammitwhat about criminals .	We can all control ourselves .	if
0	84541	He saw the fbi jackets .	Then his men started taking shape in the darkness .	and
0	58655	She strayed thus from her path , gazing at the stars of heaven .	Sometimes sighing , sometimes smiling .	and
2	148837	I 'd likely never see brad .	I was still embarrassed by the situation .	but
0	122683	The figure was dim hazy at first , but .	Then the torch flared up , and he could see it more .	and
4	131839	It was a call made by your wolf to aid you .	Your wolf signaled your change , alerting us with her beacon .	when
0	59998	The dog was as large as a grizzly .	Its three heads bore three sets of razor-sharp teeth .	and
4	4086	Was precisely he hated each and every one of them and they were eating out of his palm like rabbits , the general roared for the contest .	Aedion had enough of being serenaded by his own enemy , his ashryver eyes brilliant with a rush that chaol knew .	when
0	12818	But i kept behind the columns and statues as i moved .	All of her bullets just bounced off the marble and rattled every which way through the boathouse , ricocheting into other columns , the statues , even the ceiling high overhead .	and
0	32371	When my children were small that was composed entirely in the night ) in order to write during the day .	Grab any little bits of time .	and
4	130696	They were doing it .	They knew i was spending a ton of time with tyler , who they had paid to de-virginize me .	when
2	146589	They both had problems i really did try to stay out of it .	I could tell it was something more .	but
4	6096	It still made sense to me .	I accepted my fate with ethan james blackstone .	when
4	116283	She found herself cleaning every room she could get her hands on .	She was at home .	when
2	49731	There then was urin 's band slain in his halls , and ; urin escaped and cursed that gold with a dread curse so that none might enjoy it , and he that held any part of it found evil and death to come of it .	They stained with their blood the dragon 's hoard .	but
4	33812	Open the pouch and set it on the ground .	Mercer or the enchanters approach you .	when
2	103018	She is very weary .	The party should continue in her absence .	but
4	59353	I told all and sundry you must have lost your way home .	I was constantly pestered about where you 'd got to that night .	when
2	114092	Im sorry , said nina , try to walk through them .	Sarah , michel and paul continued to block her way .	but
0	1122	Conscious of his gaze , i cleared my throat .	Set the glass on the floor .	and
0	80687	Abraham had meant for them to slowly make their way along the wall , but she was already swimming with her head down , moving as fast as she could to the gate .	He yelled out for murien to wait .	and
2	37243	I 'd had sex with many women .	This was the first time i 'd ever been so far gone and still wearing my pants .	but
4	122381	She consumes ... `` what the fuck does he want now ? '' .	You figure in her size in comparison to how many ounces of fluid .	when
0	104988	She took another sip .	Let the alcohol do its work .	and
0	23195	Sister thomine turns to look at the abbess .	Even matelaine seems uncertain .	and
3	130115	But , i am so , so sorry .	For one second i led you to believe that something was going to happen between us .	if
0	105996	It had moved several feet from her .	Sat limp in the air .	and
2	62149	He could talk jonesy out of his room .	Chatting at least passed the time .	but
4	103474	Sci-mage was forced to fire him .	Rodney created a scene in front of general .	when
3	901	A woman ought to be able to run about naked .	She wants , without being raped , or even harassed .	if
2	133035	She had been madly in love with him .	Something had gone wrong .	but
4	103029	I was about to take the first bite of my eggs .	Someone slid into a seat next to me .	when
0	34239	A training mission had gone .	I 'd rescued them from the clutches of hex .	and
0	147242	To go on home .	Get some sleep for me .	and
3	26765	How can he learn from history .	History 's been altered .	if
0	4218	He huffed out a breath .	She figured this was round two of pissed-off mode .	and
2	22784	Dylan was looking at her , his eyebrows arched in challenge , and .	She knew he thought she was unwilling to be seen with him in public .	but
0	26512	The tree was still sagging , but the thing just glowed .	Now it was also covered in dozens of ornaments and sparkling lights .	and
0	75099	He pulled the chair out for me .	Then took his place across from me .	and
4	123383	We found will asleep on the caputos ' couch .	We got to jack 's house .	when
4	27673	Her tone was combative .	His was , and calm when his was calm .	when
4	98180	What she told you ? ' .	She caught you making calf 's eyes at her .	when
4	121315	She was confronted by a crew of television reporters .	Tracy was taken from the courtroom to await transfer to the state penitentiary .	when
2	9604	He may seem evil to you and me . '' .	In some mysterious way he 's entirely unaware of , he works for good .	but
3	79221	`` , we may have to discuss making this a full-time thing , '' kelly puts in , `` would you be interested in moving away from being a freelancer .	You keep up the good work .	if
0	144017	He picked it up and held out his coins .	Showed it to the vendor .	and
3	91377	You wait your turn , no crowding around , no group talk .	You want to talk to jere .	if
4	15308	She turned to find margie , seth 's assistant , behind her .	A hand landed on her shoulder .	when
0	50882	He struck his opponent on the shoulder .	Sent him tumbling to the side .	and
0	114035	Melinda hatcher and pippa are sleeping with their cots pushed together , forehead to forehead .	Ralphie is cradled in his sleeping mother 's arms .	and
0	111807	I looked over at liam .	Could tell he was embarrassed .	and
3	124153	He could fit into the pit .	He really wanted to .	if
3	61839	Then no one gets hurt , shed snapped at me .	Its looking and not touching .	if
2	46127	I want to tell him there 's a little dirt path worn into the hill by drunken high school students .	My mouth has jumped off my face .	but
3	65297	But it might be good . ' '' .	We ' took a little time to reassess our position .	if
3	150867	We can make you our point of contact and distributor for this planet .	You help us in this .	if
0	42426	When he got within range , he cleared his throat .	Spoke up over the din .	and
3	128635	I would have known it was time to change my plan .	You had jumped back up with an evil werewolf laugh .	if
2	92240	If it makes you feel better , call brian collie to get the latest .	Dont expect any miracles .	but
0	140458	Kim , a young bar girl of unknown circumstances , came to mind in between flashes of flying .	Stops along the way .	and
3	122405	I dont know emma .	Christopher does not approve dont tell me you are afraid of him .	if
0	32609	After all , they were to escort her .	Were not given any constraints on time .	and
4	125999	Thats when i start to panic .	So the water hits my face .	when
0	51127	For the first time in over two thousand years he felt like a man .	With that feeling came a longing so profound that it sliced through his heart .	and
2	157558	I would offer to pay you .	I cant afford a bribe .	but
0	91271	His friend in the 12:00 position now stood completely in the open .	Appeared as a man wearing a big fur coat .	and
0	3729	She was a riddle for him .	It was the first reason for him to be interested in her , solving her riddle .	and
3	91335	You ask ; a connection .	We are making a bond between us .	if
0	123951	There was a market for all kinds of things here in the prison .	This market thrived without anyone ever leaving his own cell .	and
0	158032	Cows are very dear in the coverts .	Nobody gets them very often anymore , even the harnessed beasts .	and
2	129527	He 'd never before felt the terror he 'd known when he saw maris draw joan 's attention , and .	He hoped he never felt it .	but
3	101574	It would calm the baby .	I helped her prepare her .	if
2	121367	Mother tried to come to her , to convince elizabeth to come home .	She looked at her with such fear .	but
2	96935	I mean , it 's nice .	Really - that 's a ridiculous amount of money for four triangular scraps of material .	but
0	3572	The round bed in the middle of the floor was topped by a thick black quilt and six or seven pink .	White throw pillows in varying shapes and sizes .	and
0	14283	Blood in the water in the morning , i completed the getting-ready process .	Went out to face the world .	and
1	9223	This was new and exciting .	His days invariably were dull , watching thousands of cars drive over the bridge and a dozen boats drive through the bridge .	because
2	78320	None of the lions would speak to or touch justin .	That scarcely bothered him .	but
1	98148	Mr. harper , lisa and i came here today , and some say impossible , things .	We know that you are capable of difficult .	because
2	111074	Danniella , we may be poor .	We still have our sense of courtesy .	but
0	22630	She revealed her true purpose .	Shared all of her information .	and
4	50413	Will you remember me .	I 'm scatterbrained and old .	when
4	122859	Whenever they went out with friends , paolo would insist on sitting next to her whom he naturally attracted .	Even he could be surrounded by other women .	when
0	71037	More than a full day had passed since the fire .	His mind was still consumed with what had happened .	and
0	94291	He dropped his bow a bit .	Let it hang almost limply in his right hand , which had retreated back to his side .	and
4	66462	Putting up a tree .	My mother was alive .	when
2	65875	He had done such ugliness , such evil , over the course of decades .	At least he was ending on a high note , a right note-giving jim enough time to out his gun and pick off the assassin .	but
4	3139	In the passageway the cat had uncovered .	Hed clawed down the tapestry that had hung behind the oriental screen .	when
0	71758	Max growled , pacing .	Rose to his feet .	and
0	98558	She was aware of the priestess 's coin-bright eyes , but rima fixed her gaze on anita and did not look .	Somewhere , overhead , the ceaseless churn of the birds .	and
2	34143	There was a computer on the corner of the large , elegant desk .	No papers were lying on top of the polished surface .	but
2	112244	He throws punch after punch .	They too are useless .	but
2	139823	He grabbed for his crotch .	I did it again he could cover up .	but
0	13295	We were all putting away our tools .	Having a glass of ale as an end to the day .	and
0	110752	Where i feel safer .	I watch as he paces across the brightly lit room .	and
2	7204	The police were still shooting .	The shouting and screams had quieted .	but
0	83091	Bercelak cleared his throat .	Worked hard to keep his face .	and
2	61741	Rhun kept his voice calm .	Still his minions tightened their grip on him .	but
0	71724	We 'd discussed that for a moment , tolliver asked where we paid .	The pharmacist pointed to the register at the front of the store .	and
2	62500	'' connor says , `` .	It helps promote your wedding .	but
2	69511	She had no comms or propulsion .	Her cannon was spewing out ion bolts in an almost continuous destructive stream .	but
3	29720	Or rather , we would do .	We could just all start at the same time .	if
2	148664	You were before . '' .	Now no one can deny it .	but
4	79027	She jumped at it .	He mentioned this possibility to her .	when
0	151551	[ `` i need to take from your aura .	I need to take a lot .	and
3	143669	But , they may be in luck thanks to the medical buy out program .	Somebody wanted to give up a kidney , hand , or knee cap .	if
3	49083	It would be kirja .	Any of the undead could do such a thing .	if
0	120281	His shardplate was bloodied purple up to the elbows .	He carried a glimmering gemheart in one gauntleted hand .	and
0	65403	That gave form and substance to my thoughts of a city .	What it should look like .	and
2	134267	Her hips buck up against my face .	I hold her firmly , not letting her twist .	but
2	124634	That floated about the room .	Still felt completely out of place among them .	but
0	51981	Felix was wearing jeans and a t-shirt , what he always wore .	It was who he was .	and
1	24420	He wanted to introduce me to some people on thursday .	They need gee-zee impressin whatever that means .	because
2	34770	Gwen tried to swallow .	Her mouth had gone dry .	but
4	146447	Surrounded by that burning hell .	She should be safe , outside , protected .	when
3	73127	Us win this war .	Even you are living with the pack .	if
4	65211	She had almost brought two of the three members of the security team with her to replace nes and send him back to the caravan to guard the research crew .	Saan decided to come to the subway and see what was happening .	when
0	37264	He spit the final mouthful onto the already filthy concrete .	Glared down at her .	and
2	50723	Not only did you send me away because you thought you would ruin me . '' .	You massacred an entire trafficking ring to save me .	but
2	93080	Amazingly she opened her eyes and .	Saw calvin marching up the path her dad had just trodden .	but
0	55187	Elle extricated herself from prentice 's arm . '' .	Caught sally 's hand , answering , `` of course , sweetheart .	and
0	104259	He closed his eyes .	Tightened the leash on his temper .	and
3	119818	And i would be lying .	I said i didnt feel those same emotions coursing through me .	if
2	144052	Aaron shuddered beneath her hand , and ; his claw was immediately over her hand , holding the blade in place .	She pulled back , horrified at what she had just done .	but
0	80523	My father no longer holds that title .	Does not deserve any respect .	and
0	44822	As had the area by the lake .	There were many trees that were now cloaked in green by the coming of spring .	and
2	156608	It would have been different if she kept chickens or other livestock .	She had no interest in ranching .	but
2	125946	Ian thought it was reasonable , asking for a night .	Sam had seemed so , just , sad , as if ian were trying to end things .	but
3	37051	I assure you ... you would have known .	You had faced me .	if
3	14500	To find a way to resolve the issue on my own .	Even that means abandoning all hope of marrying lady rebecca , which i can .	if
3	102202	Until then , the bitch can bark a little . '' .	It makes her feel happy .	if
0	17167	He ended with a few parting comments .	Generally avoided eye contact with me , before shaking luc 's hand , pulling on a t-shirt , grabbing his weapons , and leaving the room .	and
4	98696	We walk stella back to the dorm .	The parade is over .	when
3	70970	You ignore the pain until the enemy is dead .	You make a mistake and get cut .	if
2	76919	I 'd only taken a year and a half of french .	It was enough so i could make out the sign in the window that loosely translated to .	but
2	133045	It 'd only been a day or two since i slept .	I felt the urge to build up strength for my unavoidable meeting with mauro .	but
0	66610	Perhaps artie would simply buy himself a nice cushion .	Bring it with him when he wanted to sit and watch his ponies .	and
1	134879	`` did you go to jannalynn for help ? '' .	You wanted to enlist a shifter of some kind .	because
2	98447	`` we 've had eyes looking for her in shreveport .	No one 's spotted her .	but
4	68597	Remembering the vapor shooting from mal 's fingers , and how it had wandered through my dreams of a mystery lover .	He 'd changed half his band from animal to human .	when
0	8812	Pa will go to bed in a little while .	I can get back to my rat killing .	and
2	140793	To be the local pro .	Who lack some crucial ingredient to win their pga card .	but
3	92934	`` for my part it would be worth it . '' .	I could know for a day that i 'd won you .	if
0	121139	He had fixed his gaze on the chapel .	Started determinedly to limp on towards it .	and
2	51677	Jan 's first meeting with eischmann had been at the eindhoven novotel a week ago .	He had no idea what to expect next .	but
4	80295	She 'd only taken a couple of steps .	She stumbled into what felt like a snow-covered boulder and fell face-first in the snow .	when
0	4138	The spinning was ending .	Their feet touched solid ground .	and
4	147026	Had just poured out a mug .	I heard stirrings from the v berth .	when
0	104936	Then there were no more dogs hes responsive to your touch and , simon went on .	Requires an amount of attention that you can vary by command .	and
0	126237	He withdrew the needle , waiting .	Tossed it back onto the table .	and
4	130477	Do the germs know where the killing heat comes from .	We sterilize an instrument .	when
4	129811	I was going to be sad .	It was over in a week .	when
3	84542	To emphasize her point .	Someone were just she used air quotes .	if
4	37545	In each case the annuity would terminate , and a lump sum payment would be made ( premiums plus earnings .	The child reached the age of eighteen .	when
2	88552	He 's under eric .	Eric 's underestimating what i would do to keep rachel safe .	but
0	65472	I shook my head .	Burned the note that i was holding .	and
3	96570	... zeke blushed , raking his fingers through his hair , and i realized i 'd been staring .	I had been the slightest bit hungry .	if
2	91553	I asked aunt liz .	She says carl thinks its dumb .	but
2	65416	Finally finally she reached the helm and the pegs kept cracking against her hands .	Fought to get a grip on the twirling wheel .	but
4	101799	I worked it up into a french twist and secured it with bobby pins .	I determined it was all done .	when
2	115414	Sometimes there were the odd whispers behind the doors and windows , and nothing .	Sometimes hed hear the soft clacking of typebars striking paper .	but
3	49387	That is , ; that leons fallen for you big time .	Youre saying what i think youre saying .	if
4	135184	Waiting for the moment .	My maid reached her .	when
3	25398	He had no place to go .	She spoke true and he was free .	if
2	160224	You have a lot of power , so yes , we can .	We have the numbers .	but
0	17623	His knuckles brushed her sensitized clitoris as he unfastened his pants .	She again bucked wildly , already needing more , already verging on desperate .	and
2	146154	Dusty had tried to tell her the truth .	She wouldnt listen , lashing her with the cord while her shit-head bloke stood and watched , grinning at her .	but
1	21448	I really stretch . '' .	I have a body and that body sometimes wants to sleep .	because
4	35785	I trudged into the house with my bags and dropped them by the front door .	Rand the tow truck driver dropped me off last night .	when
0	120333	Eggs are not always being stolen ; and i dare say wanting to eat all the cows .	I am sure she would be tiresome again as soon as we had it .	and
3	149283	That race will continue to evolve as such .	They have created a totally different race .	if
2	49203	He made sure he got his money 's worth for taking the stray in .	Kept the young man fed and dry .	but
1	90744	`` but he came to me .	He somehow knows we 've been ... friendly .	because
2	75217	It was supposed to look decorative .	Baird reasoned it was there so the waywards could see the damage theyd caused themselves .	but
2	19098	We 'd had some explosive sex and the main crux of the problem was still flapping in the breeze like a signal flag .	Released some anger and frustration through our bodies .	but
2	148822	It hadnt been so late he would have read on .	It was nearing five oclock and he was anxious to see if mcdougal had returned .	but
0	75334	He cranked the a/c he had installed himself on the classic car .	Waited for it to kick in before he whooshed through the parking lot and onto the street .	and
2	83008	It is true that lewis gave the order .	The head of the levitas guards was the one to carry out the execution .	but
0	139835	Then impatiently waving aside the woman , who sought to speak further , she turned to me .	I saw the lines of weariness beneath her eyes .	and
0	36941	Then again he opened his eyes .	Slowly his vision became clear as the tapestry covering his sight disappeared .	and
1	13267	He must have jamming equipment in his house .	It did no good .	because
2	35755	There was probably a spare key at the office .	The idea of digging through brendas belongings was unpalatable .	but
0	137413	I slipped deeper into his consciousness .	Pushed through the pain and confusion and lost and hurt , deeper than i had any right to be .	and
4	53503	Ring me . '' .	You have made your choice .	when
4	92553	He shook his head .	Ted glanced over at him .	when
2	151952	`` i 'm hungry and .	He 's so good .	but
0	159069	Two girls would grow up not knowing ceri 's proud strength , how her compassion blended with a brutal justice .	She had loved them with the depth of her soul .	and
3	28651	But if you knew what i looked like , youd understand .	They were my panties .	if
2	132024	Tusk moved back a half-step , a habit picked up from one more years living in china , where people kept bothering you on the streets .	He didnt move back all that much , just enough to politely offer a hand to barbiedoll as she disembarked the osprey , and he registered a handful of names here and there before the 180 students made their way to the placement test .	but
0	49080	Charka was there to catch him .	Laid him out upon the floor .	and
3	116289	Definitely suited for human consumption .	I recall properly , this place had a restaurant that served up a mean boktor steak .	if
2	54756	The librarians might get surprised by my tricky plan - might .	They 'd never let the mokian soldiers escape back into the tunnel after destroying the robots .	but
2	157970	I could eat at the nineteenth hole club house , on my very own golf course , and , and i had innumerable number of patios and bbq areas to choose from my favouritest ( one of alices favouritest words ) place to masticate was in the greenhouse .	Even eat at the bar in the middle of my swimming pool .	but
0	86016	The captain 's eyebrow went .	He again examined his captive from top to bottom .	and
0	134475	Penrose swatted at it , changing its angle enough to make it crack uselessly against the doorframe .	Grazed it with his fist .	and
1	13096	That was wonderful . '' .	Travel was so difficult then , so uncomfortable .	because
0	130781	He took my bike from me .	Pushed it toward the shop .	and
4	52352	Gabriel placed his hand at the small of julia 's back , urging her .	It was time to enter the lecture theater .	when
4	8148	`` answer me ! '' .	I 'm talking to you .	when
0	118412	She sat in the passenger seat .	Covered her face with her hands as he drove .	and
3	135150	She actually looked far younger than seventeen .	You studied her small , lovely features .	if
4	23550	The whole town was going to know about it .	The sheriff 's son was robbed .	when
0	153270	Old timber had grown up around it .	Was manicured into an idyllic forest of rolling , grass-green hummocks and beautiful , shapely trees wreathed in ivy and autumn leaves .	and
3	64539	He was braced to grab her .	They happened to give out .	if
1	81749	Maybe she had only asked him .	She was being courteous and did not really want him to go .	because
3	130137	Then so would she .	He was going to be completely honest .	if
0	139155	He had dreamed of this moment many times over the years , but now she was .	He had never believed it would happen .	and
4	104386	He spent the time polishing and cleaning , making sure everything would be shiny and perfect when she returned .	Juni left to check out of her hotel this morning .	when
4	121265	I left you and your woman in peace and did not kill you and her as a payment for fixing my leg .	I left your cabin .	when
2	52674	Shed always found opera supremely boring .	Put up with it once a year , considering it a professional obligation .	but
4	14630	If that does not work , do not have that stone in your hand . '' .	The sun rises tomorrow .	when
0	49078	The gargant whirled , turned to the east .	Both front paws coming up off the ground .	and
4	43584	Theyve had a need to dominate , according to my aunt millie .	Others have been feral .	when
4	20964	Occasionally they would reemerge .	A way of telling them occurred to him .	when
3	88959	They 'll be waiting to the south .	You 've been followed .	if
2	152261	What 's going on under that robe .	If your face is any indication , you 're hurting in other places .	but
3	12568	I needed to know about her .	There was another woman in his life .	if
2	144090	I try to tell myself i just want to get laid .	Deep down i know that isnt it .	but
3	158366	You had to be patient .	You wanted to be a fishergirl .	if
4	122681	And karissa has absolutely no idea .	It 's happening to her .	when
1	80327	There is no way we can pay this , mom , even if we sold off some of our treasures .	A lot of them are contracted to museums .	because
2	42619	They talked about a few other matters .	Were more content watching the sunset and stillness settle in .	but
4	41614	I moved off in a daze , not convinced i was .	My breathing eventually slowed .	when
2	123925	Apolonia touched cy 's face .	Her expression still seemed emotionless .	but
0	97590	It 's in this book .	I just happen to know the answer .	and
0	120989	As a final touch , he fingered the brim of his baby-blue hat .	Then the matching feather stuck there , as though making sure the fedora was still securely perched on his head , his peacock 's plume perfectly on display .	and
4	100795	Especially when work is steady , i usually gave abundantly to the local homeless .	I 'm feeling generous .	when
3	10106	`` would andy mind ? '' .	I made a fire .	if
0	22466	He had to give valentino time to collect some men .	The waiting would be difficult .	and
3	7297	If they hurt him , her retribution would be a long , bloody process .	They made a mistake .	if
0	32712	Kicking off her shoes , she stretches out on my bed .	Rests her feet on the brick wall above my pillow .	and
2	20570	Gwen always was tempted to smack him when he acted this way .	Usually refrained from doing .	but
2	73931	It was for the best .	The ache in my chest kept me awake until night faded from the sky .	but
0	87536	He was clutching a bit embarrassed .	Looked at lilly grace .	and
2	148633	She rescues the eggs .	The bacon is a lost cause .	but
3	89597	Taking me to the safe room .	I even stepped foot out of the waiting room .	if
1	137888	But they have to write their books in the genre of science fiction , but the fool will not take offence .	The clever one will understand it .	because
2	13248	Each man dropped to the ground into a prone position and there was nothing .	Scanned their field of fire .	but
2	86717	Asleep like this , he looked like an angel .	Then given his acerbic personality she could just imagine the list of people who might want him dead .	but
2	104141	I could not help chuckle .	I asked , and .	but
0	66344	Jaego was on the street , but pull in everyone you can to ride circuits .	Probably already alerted rogir .	and
0	82738	She slapped at his hide .	He whined a little .	and
2	134644	The boxes left , the boxes arrived .	All the boxes were moved to correct areas on forklifts .	but
0	144638	She had slept for fourteen hours , since the clock in the guest room at her sister 's apartment read 2 .	Corbin was sitting in a charcoal-colored overstuffed chair next to the bed , watching her .	and
0	152381	When , upon catching sight of them lurking in the hallway , the vampire put his book down with alacrity .	Sprang to meet them .	and
4	62107	Daniel was ready to go .	He caught a faint glimmer of light to the right .	when
2	58402	Lersen still wanted campiaa .	He might have to settle for putting his own alliance .	but
4	54209	Put the anger whammy on him .	He least expected it .	when
4	3978	Choose the weakest , kill him , ride over him , and escape . '' .	Faced with many enemies .	when
4	28248	I looked up to see him smiling at me .	I felt his own sliding over mine .	when
2	159671	There was an old man having a smoke at the far end .	No one else was .	but
2	83337	My fingers itched to feel the curves of his defined physique .	That always led to him exploring mine , which usually led to a long , drawn-out lovemaking session ... and we really did have to leave .	but
2	127543	I do not wish to be insulting .	Your bare statement that the rabbit has been miniaturized three times is not really evidence that this has indeed happened .	but
2	149630	She tried to curb the sway of her hips .	That made her walk stiffly and soon became uncomfortable .	but
3	27476	I ought to be drawing a conclusion .	Somewhere in my brain a chime was ringing .	if
4	28519	I still sucked on him .	I had swallowed the last of it .	when
3	40926	Mac would kill you . '' .	He knew you were chilling it .	if
2	66819	The blow left her cheek stinging .	She knew that she had earned it .	but
1	151673	For average people who believed in nothing more than their five senses could tell them .	The concepts she took for granted in her mystic-filled life were too out there , too hocus pocus .	because
2	78464	It was true he was the only human in their mixed family .	It never bothered any of them .	but
2	120406	To be just friends with a guy .	Everyone whispered something more was going on .	but
2	52539	There are several different types of darkness magic .	The worst is from demons , zervos barked out at the start of one class .	but
0	58551	Then he dropped both darts .	Sat back down on his bed .	and
2	125230	Local folk were questioned .	When such an attack failed to materialise , accusations quickly gave way to a feeling of festive cooperation .	but
3	62045	Mr. chillingworth would have known something concerning him .	We had thought to ask him .	if
0	88887	Launched across the counter .	Grabbed him up by the front of his shirt .	and
3	153922	She 'll be waiting there , with her handmaid .	You want to come .	if
0	137696	I 'm your daughter ? '' .	You would do that to me .	and
4	54716	Alma , newly enlightened , laden with the divine responsibility of fostering mankind in her womb , displayed a renewed verve .	She joined the others with her lyre .	when
2	39129	Frances strained her eyes through the diffused glare of the sun to see what was happening .	At that moment the horse and carriage were momentarily enshrouded in a plume of dirt and dust .	but
0	91940	He kicked it open .	Pointed his gun at the man in the lab coat .	and
0	88477	The awkward silence stretched out .	I suddenly became painfully aware of how different i was from two years .	and
2	159460	He did not like the passive approach .	Recognized that what daniels said made sense .	but
2	134533	It may sound silly .	I need to know hes in a nice place .	but
2	35532	I know you 've said you wanted to take some time off after high school .	How old are you .	but
2	150475	It was a strange word .	He knew the meaning .	but
2	120962	I wanted this gift .	Chose not to give the same gift .	but
0	78929	The rain had stopped entirely when sparhawk and talen came out of the house .	They could see blue sky out over the lake to the west .	and
2	160552	She preferred guns to getting her hands dirty with hand-to-hand combat .	After being trained with them , she was too lazy to go through the process of getting her own and never felt the pressing need to own one .	but
2	36800	It wasnt an extremely strong movement .	They had a couple thousand supporters in the u.s. .	but
1	159805	It had to be a trucks or something similar .	It occupied the road for almost all his/her width .	because
2	1274	I know you demand vengeance for your deceased husbands and fathers .	Think how wretched and depressed you will feel when they toss you into a cage full of man-eating tigers that will claw you to pieces while they rip your arms and legs off in their jaws.i can see you are unmoved .	but
2	82332	You need to relax before traci rips your head off . '' .	Yeah , i 'll be .	but
3	36521	They will hunt down every available male within a six-mile radius . '' .	You give them the chance .	if
2	54183	Beeps and sirens went .	My mind was scrambled from his electrifying touch .	but
4	37166	The ship shuddered slightly , and obos angled the path of the traveler away from earth while gently accelerating .	The energy field made contact with the comet 's surface .	when
2	75440	I do not know with any degree of accuracy .	It seemed a long time indeed before anything happened to distract me from my contemplation .	but
2	65988	Well , i dont know what the technical specifications are for a boulder .	This feels like a pretty big rock .	but
3	30190	I shall indeed send for you .	Ever it transpires that i am in trouble .	if
4	4342	We pulled off the lock system from its mouth , but i know where it is .	The harrows were new .	when
2	100254	When mom and frank moved to seattle , they invited me to go with them .	I wanted to stay .	but
0	4525	They turned this way .	Surprised that nobody was there to meet them .	and
4	130803	That was at least not as irritating .	They sung his name : eu-mor-fo-pou-lis , each taking a syllable and then singing it in a round like frre jacques .	when
0	38551	Another set of hands grabbed him .	Slammed him once again into the wall .	and
3	155211	It almost felt like if i let my guard down that she would get swallowed like the rest of them , and where would that have left me .	She didnt really need to be .	if
0	83160	We 'd lived in the same small town my whole life .	I 'd attended the same school with the same people since i was five years old .	and
2	127282	At first , i 'd thought they all liked her because she was new .	It was definitely more than that .	but
2	77661	My face had healed without scarring .	Dad had told me that top plastic surgeons had worked on it while id been unconscious .	but
0	155501	They made the sky hoochie dress dumber n hell in some butt ugly uniform .	He told her loud .	and
0	25383	Think ill go get drunk .	Have a few for jamie .	and
0	109472	Hartlick chomped his cigar .	Turned back to stare at bowler .	and
0	95460	They realized what he was .	Had a chance to unlink .	and
4	58059	Rather than look him in the eye , i remove the empty glass .	Cash sets it down on the bar .	when
0	103780	She had misplaced something - something very valuable .	Its loss left an aching kind of vacancy .	and
4	153538	The shadow of a rock fell on the white cover of the wagon .	They crossed a forest .	when
2	20445	Late afternoon and there werent many people in the bar .	Jim stood up and waved as scott scanned in search .	but
3	135282	`` when i 'm done that 's fine . '' .	You want to lock me up .	if
4	71925	She never felt displaced .	She was with him .	when
2	30195	The last thing i needed was for him to be hurt about this .	He knew that it had been coming .	but
3	152108	Shed remain locked up in this castle for the rest of her life .	Her father had his way .	if
3	7286	Will she settle for peace with .	He is found guilty .	if
2	46028	Ben could tell she was nervous was afraid his voice would tremble .	Wanted to tell her not to worry .	but
2	57347	Yeah , the money was huge , it was linked to my life .	It was also about mom .	but
2	119394	He was in stable condition .	Henry had read critical in his old fi7iend 's eyes .	but
0	142889	Perfect peace hit the shoals of my tears .	Could not stand against them .	and
4	99808	Maybe they gave me a new body .	I arrived in hell , but i dont see why they would bother .	when
4	153102	Lady kate said , thank the gods .	His eyes fluttered open .	when
0	80780	Where they could shift in privacy .	Join gregori and mikhail in the cave of warriors .	and
2	70826	We can not see it .	It is throwing things around , and alex says it is talking to him .	but
4	35172	There was a total of 12 students .	Class began : three males , and nine females .	when
0	25943	Her head turned as the world started to get foggy and dark .	She found herself staring into david 's eerie silver eyes .	and
2	117739	`` few people expect a man of your age and mercantile concerns to bother himself with balls and parties . '' .	Having a young socialite to send instead of a rejection note will serve as an advantage to your reputation .	but
3	154748	Do we call them in .	We have the coordinates .	if
0	19353	They bite things and , '' with their mouths full .	Then say , `` i wonder if this is poisonous .	and
2	100116	There were countless reasons to say no .	Even when they found something that struck their fancy and made them want to say yes , it was often just as ridiculous .	but
0	45927	You raise your hand or voice against me .	Be assured he will be threatened .	and
2	86272	Minnie tightened her persisting embrace around honeybee and the silence they shared weighed more than further endearing words could have .	It would not be long before faint sobs crept into the room and chilled the girls inside .	but
2	24908	Ellie sized up budda .	She couldnt make him fit as addies brother , even a half one she didnt know .	but
2	93890	My body remembers every last detail .	Instead of feeling it rushing back , i feel nothing .	but
0	111304	But narrok looked upon mistward with a slow , almost delighted sweep of the head pointed at the curving ward-stone gates .	Drew his iron blade .	and
4	50131	He 'd let her down , leaving her alone to deal with her family .	They were teenagers and he 'd gotten arrested .	when
2	8233	Tucker felt sorry for utkin .	He kept his face impassive .	but
4	36595	Of course , it was on the one night , but it made him look like a prince of the blood .	It might hinder them .	when
2	18679	I happen to find some foods very pleasing .	It 's not necessary .	but
0	27658	He stalked closer to her .	Then he leaned to scoop up a loose rock from the ground .	and
0	75734	Unable to wait any longer , i pushed to my feet .	Raced to the first floor .	and
1	42531	It must be worse than the beating .	I hear a lot of arguing .	because
2	20994	I 've never really thought about it like that . '' .	I guess you 're .	but
3	23317	Of course , it all starts with voting .	Theyre not even gon na vote .	if
4	128102	They glittered with satisfaction .	He opened his eyes .	when
3	139974	I 'll have my pepper spray on me . '' .	That would make you happier .	if
3	24562	He was going to lose himself .	The information he put inside her mind did not unfurl .	if
0	159787	He wiggled his fingers in meekas ribs and .	She couldnt help but laugh and jump away from the suddenness .	and
0	160368	When he sees my swollen cheek .	Then he turns back to nicholas .	and
3	31217	Who in their college days would have lived on a diet of nothing but dewar 's and marlboros .	Left to her own devices .	if
0	149419	She was slightly older than him , in her late twenties .	Had a fiery temper to match her hair .	and
2	85669	The commander must be stopped , i can help you . '' .	You must listen to me .	but
2	65424	It felt as bony as it looked .	It was warmer than he had expected .	but
1	33696	Everyone kate had herpes .	She was sure kate was going to tell everyone about hanna 's eating issues .	because
2	111966	It was on the tip of her tongue to beg him to f**k her .	That would only disappoint him .	but
4	25926	That is they keep some of us in the rolodex .	A real rodeo clown gets sick or injured .	when
2	117787	I might be speechless . '' .	I 'm not too stunned to do this .	but
0	159167	A sound startled me .	I looked to the hole in the roof .	and
3	101041	To get those extra pounds off .	He wanted to attract any woman at all .	if
4	15561	This was a possibility .	We took him in .	when
0	112167	This was a round wooden table , weathered but often draped .	Used when any of the court want to take their repast in the garden .	and
0	51674	They brought the kids around tashas age .	Made them to stand at the gate while the adults patrolled around the region .	and
2	39378	It had taken years filled with more trials and pain than i thought i could endure to bring me to the point where i could soar by his side , to share this moment with him .	I 'd do it all again , a thousand times over .	but
2	118659	Ash held his hands up and jaron followed his move and blocked him .	Tried to take a step around jaron .	but
4	109582	I know were going to have a wonderful life together , the three of us .	This child is born .	when
1	7173	Then he looked up .	He sensed movement in the corner of his eye at the marriott 's door two blocks .	because
2	160090	Chapter 9 i arrived at the italian ice stand to order my favorite flavor .	They didnt make a size large enough to take the sting out of my bruised ego .	but
0	22590	We 'd met the likes of francis bacon , somerset maugham and maurice richardson at the colony generally got our education from the best novelists , journalists and artists of our day .	Read beckett , miller and durrell in olympia press .	and
4	116952	The group climbing or descending the mountain .	The telescope he had in his possession was not powerful enough to focus on such minute details .	when
4	133329	Then this evening it had blown all his theories .	He had run into her in the hall .	when
0	64663	I spotted the guy from my psych class .	Walked up to him , putting my hand around his back to tap his shoulder .	and
4	139892	He began to busy himself getting her chosen mode of transportation ready for departure .	She told him she intended to drive the vw bus .	when
2	151758	I was just kidding .	Maybe i should try that trick more often on you .	but
0	108066	It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble .	He wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon , indeed at .	and
2	60612	Tom , i know you mean .	I really dont want to talk .	but
2	155430	Being a homeless bum has its upside .	There just aint no more surprises .	but
2	85117	I know this must seem strange .	I need to ask a few more questions .	but
4	112762	Left it in the garage .	He shopped with the truck .	when
4	136431	Jace had made a move , and just like cinderella , i 'd finally found love with my prince .	I had decided to stand up for myself and stop giving my body away to whatever wealthy hot guy hit on me .	when
3	97585	We can leave . '' .	It 's too much .	if
4	109335	We both began laughing .	I looked back up at the nurse .	when
0	67460	It was an ancient bargain .	It had something to do with iron .	and
2	119987	I 'm good at it .	It 's fun and i feel like i 'm part of a family .	but
4	53068	They voted unanimously to pave it .	Each council member ruined a five hundred dollar pair of shoes getting into the building .	when
2	120911	Tusk felt the same .	Was less adamant about it .	but
1	30625	Partly , it was .	There was much you were taking in and i was concerned about you .	because
3	147163	I will be able to tell if it truly is .	He comes in with something that seems important .	if
3	12877	I think its awesome .	That is what you really want .	if
2	88942	Keirran , i noted , moved a bit stiffly , favoring his right side .	Other than that , he seemed fine .	but
3	25835	Anybody would be disappointed with this sort of weather on her wedding day .	Even she was british and had spent a lifetime learning not to expect anything .	if
4	160741	She asked what happened .	I was making my bed on mackenzie 's futon .	when
0	81457	He then had the beat fly at the six .	Turn into a hot purple smoke that slowly disappeared , making it look like the creature surrounded them without form .	and
3	82493	Then death will be the least of your worries .	I discover you were unable to complete this task i set for you .	if
0	105670	Kevin walked straight to the bottom of the stairs .	Opened a small , three-foot high door to a small space under the stairs and landing .	and
0	103644	The monks of the third realm had fought the battles , but it still exists within the other realms .	Had eradicated the forces of darkness from their world .	and
4	29566	I bobbed my head .	He raised his brows questioningly at me .	when
4	93064	A few minutes later jace had to step back long enough for them to ensure bethany could breathe on her own .	The tube was gone .	when
2	99142	Hungry as she was , she would have enjoyed almost anything .	The tart , crisp sauerkraut and the sausages , bursting with juice and spices , were a rare treat .	but
0	126648	Arrive in the underworld ? '' .	Defeat five hundred thousand demons by yourself .	and
0	155233	She took the handcuffs , then - unasked - put her wrists behind her .	Snapped one on her right wrist .	and
2	36528	Tammy tried to run past me .	I was faster , knocking over desks in my way as i grabbed her .	but
3	137885	When one has a secret , or a suspicion , or even a treasure , it is always safer .	A lot of people know about it .	if
2	65481	Its crew seems none too thrilled .	They 'd follow their captain .	but
2	114572	She longed for the little things like sharing a meal with him , or chatting with him after she came home from work .	She missed the big things .	but
4	150280	We all instantly bonded .	We met the first day of high school .	when
2	50401	He should have just burned them there and .	Instead he left them there for me to do .	but
1	151749	That her husband had determined to take her .	He would not leave her out of his sight .	because
3	127310	I 'll personally kick their ass , alright ? '' .	Anybody knocks you over .	if
4	43518	* * * she woke .	Logan opened the door and came into the bedroom .	when
0	36999	He wrapped his arms around me .	Pulled me with him down onto the pillow where we stayed snuggled together in a fortress of shared heartbreak .	and
0	59664	They would round the hallway corner see bria and me standing at the far end .	Another thirty seconds , and .	and
0	117655	Oliver had totall y freaked when i 'd picked up his notebook .	He 'd realized i was getting a flash off it .	and
3	123663	He appeared to believe it .	Even it was rubbish .	if
4	155617	`` this reminds me of camping . '' .	I was a kid , with my dad .	when
2	125921	She 'd learned to control her bloodlust .	Instinct was still instinct .	but
0	82119	He put the pot on the hot plate .	Dropped the pre-measured bag of coffee into the machine .	and
4	53093	Only really losing his temper .	He lost a warrior to the raiders .	when
0	29858	With difficulty , her limbs being tightly bound , miss tarabotti wiggled from lying on her back to lying on her side , facing lord akeldama .	Her physical dexterity further impeded by her dratted corset and bustle .	and
4	68176	She has never taken her eyes off him .	He first approached xiona .	when
2	131486	`` it took some convincing . '' .	My father is a wealthy man .	but
4	153632	Lip trembling , on the verge of tears .	Thats holly walked straight up to her face .	when
3	121094	We will abide with him . '' .	He canna go with us .	if
3	121401	If the unsub had wanted me to come here ... `` we 're missing something . '' .	This was part of the unsub 's plan .	if
3	125063	Gladys will kill me .	I go back without it .	if
4	36368	It started to contract , to trap the thief and hold him in place .	Druzeel uttered the last word .	when
4	97764	I dropped them on the ground , by accident .	I had them in my hand .	when
4	31036	This time , i could hear gas flowing into the car .	I squeezed the trigger on the nozzle .	when
0	37703	I will look forward to mine .	What awaits me there .	and
2	157237	It was too dark for me to see his expression .	With his enhanced vision , he could see mine as i unzipped my ankle-length parka and let it drop to the ground .	but
1	120353	Her preoccupation was at least in part .	This was the last night on which we would all be .	because
3	57655	Anything at all , just have her ask dorian 's staff and they 'll take care of it . '' .	There 's anything she needs .	if
0	157014	The door himself , punched aeron twice , smiled sweetly , although a bit .	Replaced the block between them .	and
0	123347	She trusted the headmaster .	They had a moment alone , shed like to ask what he remembered about her mom .	and
4	98231	She pierced jessica with a venomous glare .	The dazed woman took two full breaths of clean mountain air , and seemed to get her bearings .	when
2	79663	She shook her head incredulous .	It quickly shifted into an eager nod .	but
0	54547	It ripped up the side .	For one moment he felt her cold flesh against his skin before fleeing into the kitchen .	and
3	15349	Blame the public safety council .	You have to blame anyone .	if
0	114363	I grabbed a medium size cup , and handed it to her , so at least shed have something .	Filled it with coke .	and
0	43649	To locate the night encampments of all the bands of troops in the area .	To sniff out the sentries .	and
4	143170	That draws us closer and closer .	We 're in the same room .	when
0	53547	He had decided he was going to court her .	She had been spoiled rotten for the last week .	and
0	15592	They were heading into potentially much more dangerous territory tomorrow .	A trip to the police station to fill in forms would cast a shadow over preparations which had , so far , gone .	and
2	68618	The glass ring was still spinning now at barely a crawl .	I assumed the disc was doing .	but
0	66870	He felt her lips pressed to his .	His heart seized at the tender gesture .	and
3	76937	Were all in trouble .	You get the sorceress stuff figured out and have unlimited words to use for spells .	if
3	125218	He would immediately march to the defense of the borderlands .	Command were given to the dragon .	if
2	64250	It would have been easy to take them .	We saw they were stupid we did not know yet how bent they were , and i did not wish to stretch my authority beyond the creatures of my own world .	but
2	113074	I knew we were being over the top .	My rage controlled me .	but
0	53524	I crossed one landing after another .	Came at last to the bottom floor .	and
3	95588	They 'll send me to hell .	I give the archangels cause to think i 'm even remotely in love with you .	if
0	9868	There were the pale green young leaves which were a lime color when the sun shone through them , and there were the yellow leaves which had gotten old and hardly needed a push to fall off the potted bush .	There were the darker mid-life leaves which passed no light .	and
3	82157	Our tanks would 've needed months to arrive , and when they did , the massive weight of the seventy-ton abrams would 've crushed ten of the twelve bridges between the port and the battlefield .	A ground war had erupted in kosovo .	if
4	103100	Themselves beesely walked around to the top of the table , otto sitting to his immediate right .	Everyone had finally seated .	when
1	12742	But , it looks like acceleration .	The universe is always getting bigger .	because
4	67743	When i see the way the child clutches him .	I see the way andrs holds michael .	when
1	108344	In the latest book , there is one laughable situation where some german christians supposedly read a verse in the revelation about gods people being told to come out of babylon .	The city was going to be destroyed in one hour , and so they travelled to the antichrist headquarters in baghdad just to save god the embarrassment of not having anyone inside to come out when the time came .	because
2	105999	You do look like you could use some downtime , said kenny .	Then feeling like he had overstepped his bounds , he looked down .	but
4	86735	He looked interested and asked if she could explain the item in more detail .	She described the item to the king .	when
0	50232	For the first time since the travellers had entered the vale , the sky was entirely clear .	Bright stars filled the heavens above .	and
2	38753	Want that old shirt , judy snatched it away from her .	Here ill take it .	but
1	81795	Want him to do it , he would .	I think , for you .	because
0	55396	He gets about three or four a year .	Sends maybe one or two times .	and
2	2280	I looked at him with my mouth forcefully pushed into a frown , trying to pretend i was no longer laughing .	Short bursts of giggles kept sneaking through .	but
0	118190	The sky was very blue .	The puffy white clouds seemed almost to dance .	and
0	62381	I have good feelings about the dean . '' .	I will start classes in january .	and
2	37410	If the records are right , your sister may be .	She is probably living on the streets .	but
0	29793	It took them several days to reach the port city of castano on the north coast of the empire . '' .	Gunda led them to a place he called an `` inn .	and
2	111824	He knew graeak was old , living far longer than any normal man .	He had never looked even close to his actual age .	but
0	17355	`` i already have , '' he whispered .	Gave an ironic smile .	and
2	89939	Suspected my parents believed i was too serious and focused to pursue mindless entertainment .	Sometimes i really needed to hide out in somebody else 's world when mine became unbearable .	but
2	155926	I must apologize for any inconvenience this may cause .	This verification session will have to be postponed .	but
2	39626	Two hospital orderlies had offered to lift him in .	Shed wanted to do this for herself .	but
3	70332	Then let her do it .	She was going to do it .	if
0	47926	He entertained them with slightly [ unclear ] stories about the blood aristos he 'd served in various courts .	Told them nothing about his life .	and
4	154246	She showed no thought to basic etiquette . '' .	Visiting someone else 's home .	when
3	58983	... it would be you .	There was a haven in this world for me .	if
0	133210	I take our joined hands .	Push the side of his leg eat .	and
3	76591	He would have trembled , shrank .	He 'd had control of his body .	if
0	4198	Ronan charged in , became a giant kodiak bear before he hit the living room .	Already throwing off his clothes .	and
2	73477	She wants to look , she wants to see what 's under my jeans .	She 's trying not to show it .	but
2	74252	For a moment her view of cole was blocked and extended his hand to help her out .	Then lucas shifted to the side .	but
3	156303	They might save arthurs kingdom from annihilation at the hands of morgan and the rebels .	He and broderic could return with the axe .	if
2	3960	She hoped to become one .	The time which in her own mind she fixed upon for this happy change was still far distant .	but
4	33959	I was working innocently at my desk .	I felt cole press in behind me and take the mouse from my hand .	when
0	77607	I shuffled up the stairs followed the soft sounds .	Passed the second-floor landing .	and
0	47202	They loaded him in a canoe .	Were on their way to the village of the yellow leaf .	and
2	81620	What i was doing was wrong .	I knew i had to finish what i started .	but
1	7608	Somehow he seemed to know .	He waylaid dawson and-i hoped-would keep dawson from throwing blake through a window in front of everyone once matthew shared who blake was .	because
4	60655	It showed her perfect white teeth .	She made a crooked little grin .	when
4	134632	Luxa had told gregor , `` we may as well get it over with .	She had started the war .	when
0	20605	It seemed like an arduous session as we were packing up i asked her why .	Paid attention , trying to learn something , but .	and
4	59904	I took my chance .	Calvin 's eyes shifted back to jude .	when
2	54749	The words echoed in her head .	She could not open her mouth to speak them , to lie .	but
2	91461	That had been weeks earlier and .	Already seemed as distant as a dream .	but
0	69666	Fur , silk , jewels , the weekly cost of just keeping herself looking beautiful ... of course , he 'd always made it clear that she was to pay him back , but ... maybe arobynn just wanted to increase what wealth he already had .	She 'd been giving him a cut of her wages to do .	and
4	146995	And , i want all of them here with me .	The holidays come round .	when
0	37583	It takes a lot of energy to fly you know .	We do it very well it is very useful to have someone watching things for us .	and
3	11139	She 'd divorce him .	He stopped going to stupid therapy .	if
3	135498	She might have suspected that this was all one giant prank that had gone sadly wrong .	It were not for the wounded and dying guard .	if
2	4131	Almost never catch them , and over the years i have caught a few that i hope will be included in my final accounting .	Occasionally i get one .	but
1	101782	I stuck with mark kadison .	He was a friend of mine and if they called , he 'd just laugh .	because
2	49501	He had been nothing gentlemanly this whole time and .	She had wanted nothing but to throw herself at him .	but
2	115395	Everything about their situation should have kept them .	It did n't . .	but
0	12890	She was such a little thing .	He worried that he 'd break her .	and
0	101432	Griped , she ducked , swearing at me .	Then shot at the brown-haired woman chucking paperwork on the bonfire .	and
2	57356	I know it 's going to be hard ? '' .	Do you think you can do that .	but
2	38304	I wont tell you what it means , because it probably wont factor in .	It is possible i will learn something about the person who captures the orb .	but
0	146261	A flash of lightning from outside gave her a quick visual of the corpse crumpling to her knees in front of jim 's body .	Then all hell broke loose .	and
2	129529	Looking at my hands , i shake my head .	I 'm not so sure .	but
2	153491	I wanted to cry out in elation , to pump my fists with joy .	I lowered my trembling hands to my side .	but
2	48573	Dear penthouse , i never thought this sort of thing could happen to me .	There was this really hot nurse and ... no , there had been something very wrong about the situation .	but
2	130079	Now , as for your question , i can tell you a little concerning what you ask . '' .	Only which is meant for man to know .	but
2	123780	When he was done laughing .	He was still chuckling .	but
2	11069	My father walked toward the doorway .	Stopped to look at me before leaving .	but
0	68501	She danced nakeddamn well , he might addshe had a vibrator that matched her decor .	She twice now had embraced the eroticism that feeding could inspire and had had an orgasm .	and
1	128230	They are treating you as soldiers .	You are staying in the barracks .	because
2	5680	For a few heartbeats she thinks she is alone then she hears a growl and .	Turns to see another in that place .	but
0	82604	The banshees ears pricked .	Its yellow eyes honed in on the spot the sound came from .	and
3	154665	You 'd realize that i 'd hate you for what you 've done .	You knew me at all .	if
2	70633	I knew he was a big deal if he 's in magazines .	I had no idea he was a two million dollar big deal .	but
4	101573	She will contact us .	She needs our services .	when
4	86874	They were welcomed into the middle of it , a flask was offered to robert and he took it without hesitation , drinking .	They reached the line of men .	when
2	23044	Michelle said annoyed , we had enough food .	You leave without eating .	but
3	101656	You could not understand magic at all .	You did not understand why magic worked , why you were able to capture it and shape it to your will .	if
2	128580	I looked around for him the next couple of days .	He was keeping out of sight .	but
4	86090	We already had a river .	Stream moved here from concord two a few years .	when
0	128206	Sent into the boys dorm .	Now only two of them had managed to catch up .	and
3	26747	To update me on events .	Even they seem unimportant .	if
2	64577	Yerardi did run some bookies .	Loan-sharking was his thing .	but
2	51142	Hes got other stuff to do .	I think he just wants to give us some room .	but
2	77543	The song gained popularity among music folk who liked period pieces .	It seems the song was actually written decades after the emancipation proclamation .	but
2	88865	I 'm no lion expert .	His eyes looked sunken , and his legs were lanky and thin .	but
2	143894	He could order all the trains stopped .	That would require leaving the platform and establishing communication with someone with the clout to get it done .	but
4	131853	Teth got down the fine porcelain tea service , another gift from ipid , and a sealed pot of tea leaves .	The room was presentable and the first wisps of steam were rising from the kettle .	when
2	99580	A strange change had come upon nienor and .	Now she outran them all , flying like a deer among the trees with her hair streaming in the wind of her speed .	but
4	46376	Adamans panic turned to pure terror .	Joshua fflowers began to recover .	when
3	159179	You will forgive me .	I do not ask you to visit .	if
0	60258	Before leaving , i left the man into one of the abandoned buildings .	Placed him under a sleep command using me will , just for a few hours .	and
0	18355	Jorge brought water in a canteen hed found in mr. wilcoxs camping gear .	Gave it to marina .	and
2	83776	The second point , '' caesar continued , `` will be difficult . '' .	We can certainly work on it .	but
3	3047	Will , it 's your doing .	I 'm a ghoul .	if
4	126840	Marina greeted him , good-morning .	He was nearing her .	when
1	66593	To be honest , i 'm more concerned . '' .	Billy bennett has been kind of dragging his feet on this case .	because
0	72118	Max 's eyes went wide .	He jutted out his chin , exasperated .	and
0	91440	Sylvia threw the bag strap over one shoulder across her body , zipped it up .	Then put her coat on over the jacket .	and
0	111531	When i was baking .	They were cracking jokes and making an effort to include me in their frivolity .	and
0	48537	Coming from the gray-green oblong .	Anchoring themselves to the metal hide of the falcon .	and
0	31826	Zane pulled on it .	The bit of metal dug into vin 's skin .	and
3	132787	And , she wanted nothing more .	She was being honest with herself .	if
0	148798	Pavel was still keeping close tabs on them through his professional sleuth .	Would do so until he had collected both of his prizes .	and
0	90706	He communed with us for a time .	When i looked around , a sudden panic came over me .	and
0	85047	Fastillion also knew the hunter named spotted-crow .	Could recall many stories about his courageous exploits .	and
4	11843	I 'm grateful for cross 's arms around me .	I told him my story , even if at the moment i knew him as evan .	when
3	87530	What should he do .	They really did recognize him .	if
2	42693	She wanted to run in the opposite direction .	She knew this was some sort of test .	but
4	102359	A parent looks at a child .	The child attempts to make definitive statements about life .	when
0	13999	Eyeing the razor sharp edge .	Remembering what leah had told him about the metal .	and
0	115644	The list was her idea .	My only contribution was to nod and listen to her .	and
2	48129	Where this was going .	He didnt like the tone of erics questions .	but
2	86800	He not only believe that people were easy to fool .	Some people wanted to be fooled .	but
0	34131	His head hit the dirt .	He screamed aloud when something tore into his face .	and
4	34468	He was moving so slow and gentle .	I finally came back to my senses .	when
2	56510	Hunter felt a hot flare shoot into his bloodstream .	He refused to be baited .	but
0	135447	Every stride carried them a good twenty feet .	Though they looked ponderous , their pace was , like a gargant 's , swifter than one would expect .	and
4	50745	She got a glimpse of his tongue .	The fleshlumpeater was speaking .	when
2	155708	I have tried to tell him he is .	He has always cared for and protected us .	but
3	70061	One caveat was the player would have to throw double his bet into the pot .	The flipped card matched one of the others .	if
0	110969	I turned it on .	The lights flared and then steadied .	and
2	105301	She was standing by the sink , staring out the window at the river .	Stone had a feeling she was a million miles .	but
0	92784	It descended next to him .	Caught a small animal far below a golden , furry thing whose luck had run out .	and
2	126693	The chain linking them together looks real .	It makes soft pings as it drags on the sidewalk , not the clinking and clanking of metal .	but
4	66352	They would communicate that to hank .	They learned of the locations or destinations of various bikers .	when
2	152400	Will tried to take her back into his arms , and she tried to push him .	It was the last thing she wanted .	but
2	89461	Eamon has been arrested .	Even if so , they have probably gone out of their way to destroy any documents or proof .	but
0	60849	Aspen heard his aunts voice ring out over the aviary cacophony .	Then a bonnet launched itself out the mercantile 's front door .	and
0	138878	Sharine laughed , joining them .	Earned quite amount of money from the gambling table .	and
3	156298	She might be very familiar with the temple 's layout or the expansive ruins beyond it .	She 'd been here since the night of the club fire .	if
4	104691	There were two areas of my life .	I 'd been blessed with luck .	when
0	75020	I crossed my ankles .	Leaned deeper into the counter .	and
0	136179	He took the gun from the angel 's plump hand .	Sighted along the stubby barrel .	and
0	14600	There were evil forces afoot in the area .	Although they were nowhere close to being supernatural , she was willing to employ any tool at her disposal to ward off any nefarious influences .	and
3	34062	Tried once more to fulfill her most important duty .	She carried another child .	if
4	105264	He had a feeling which one hed be reaching .	He broke through a pane of glass .	when
4	13887	It had all began .	Serit arrived at the stables and refused to wear the treetop clothing jaysh had retrieved from the shun .	when
3	76606	To fight the zeepods .	They could lead him to intelligent life .	if
2	95281	He slammed his fist into the wall and he didnt care about the pain , either .	Felt blood on his hand .	but
3	30945	`` plus you 've only made it harder for the detectives or fbi to do their jobs .	Now you contaminated the scene .	if
3	98678	You say - `` `` i do .	You desire her . '' .	if
1	32639	Where the book belonged .	I heard it fall to the floor behind me with a thump .	because
2	83004	I have the urge to put them back in place .	The pained expression on his face warns me that it 's best not to touch him .	but
0	135799	As ipid had said , she had a clear , strong hand .	Was an effective , if inelegant , writer .	and
4	134423	Dad - '' jason began .	The two females disappeared .	when
0	124472	The air slips away , my heart dies .	My necklace floats off my neck as the water stills .	and
0	69683	Now i have to clean house for the next thirteen days .	Either live at the busy bee or starve to death .	and
3	117105	But , you might have agreed .	You 'd seen this kid .	if
3	158228	He 'd get annoyed and leave .	She presented him with all her problems instead of her ass for a good spanking .	if
0	10731	It looked like another guest room , larger than his own , but held two long , sturdy tables , one of which was clear and the other cluttered with many containers , instruments , and bunches of herbs .	It was stuffed with cabinets and dressers .	and
2	106155	I know it 's not home to you .	I 'm going to let you decorate to your hearts content .	but
0	27209	Folded into a hundred paper cranes .	Sent on a breeze to one person in cier'djaal . .	and
4	74276	She bit her lip .	Her finger touched the screen .	when
2	26184	Sunday morning , around the hours of nine and ten , must go down as a couple of the most agreeable and tranquil time passages of my creaking week .	Come sunday afternoon you would think that some garage mechanic has broken into my homestead and let all the air out of my personalitys tyres .	but
2	147456	I was anxious to hear the company gossip , wiping bits of blue cheese dressing off his chin .	To hear what i wanted i would have to wait as he spoke through the crunch of the lettuce .	but
0	32874	Then he leaned down , one hand at my hip .	Pressed his lips to mine .	and
2	113115	He staggered for balance .	Agony forced him to his knees .	but
1	61139	Dead and i am sad for him , but if you go on as you are being , i will be sadder for you .	You will be dead too , even though your body lives .	because
0	99922	I leaned towards his ear .	Told him what i know .	and
1	36116	Even they were not to stay , ; or at least refusing to acknowledge it was not theirs .	It felt to temeraire a little as though they were reclaiming their territory .	because
0	985	Vann placed his carry sack on the counter .	Slid it over to jeris .	and
0	6595	She took a deep breath , closing her eyes .	Tapping the large golden bangle around her wrist .	and
0	25872	She grabbed the tamers leg , sending lani stumbling .	Pushed as hard as she could .	and
2	125132	He moved to take the mug to the kitchen .	She intercepted it and dropped both cups off in the sink herself .	but
4	85065	He 'd thought her to be .	She sent her dad to say her goodbyes .	when
3	119316	About one of us being set to blow us up .	We go sour - how can you be sure this failsafe person is still among us .	if
3	145598	She was pulling in a lot more than a lowly bookkeeper would be .	Her usual customers were of kimball 's ilk .	if
0	69037	To empty the gas tanks manage to do all of this in rush hour .	Buy a hundred little things .	and
4	14086	He seemed genuinely concerned .	He said , `` nothing , except pray that a liver becomes available .	when
3	118671	This was the time to go inside and lock her door .	Even she was just getting spooked by the wind or something like a raccoon .	if
2	95136	She 'd followed his directions about buying a lot of black .	She 'd also bought him some white stuff , which she said ivould be much more comfortable in the summer and ivould look good with his tan .	but
0	5751	Ellison laughed let her go .	Gave myka a final squeeze .	and
0	42861	Lunging forward , surreal grabbed his hair with one hand .	Slashed titian 's knife across his throat .	and
4	145790	She discovers that she can not escape her past , and is driven to make an agonising decision .	The family is slaughtered .	when
0	40663	I pulled it out .	Glanced at the screen .	and
4	132271	Through her lashes she squinted the sheer blue sky .	Suddenly a small cargo plane skimmed the treetops .	when
4	84236	The fingers were too weak to fully comply .	He tried to make his hand into a fist .	when
2	91247	Imagine some slime molds that receive the call of the slime-mold draft .	They just happen to be in a place where food is still abundant .	but
0	110182	Adele had still not moved ; it was ice cold and trembling .	Eda reached out to take her hand .	and
2	90370	Grabbing a woman whose husband had already run off may raise suspicions and even police involvement .	You add dead bodies , possibly two dead children , the attention becomes nearly intolerable .	but
0	30951	Well , he has good days .	Badand has probably aged about fifteen years since this all started .	and
4	131132	What mr. crepsley would think .	He woke and found his spider missing and a note in its place .	when
0	155435	My emotions are strongly linked to people in this house .	It makes running away impossible .	and
3	68767	To many a wounded man .	The lie would give him a moments peace .	if
0	87049	Then he sat back into the chair .	Took a long puff on the cigar .	and
0	8685	Mrs. ogg 's eyes twinkled .	She looked from tiffany to mistress weatherwax like someone watching a tennis match .	and
3	36493	Wolf would keep his mouth shut and make excuses .	The time came when she noticed stealth was missing for a few days .	if
2	25684	She had to wait at the intersection .	Fortunately he turned green shortly after .	but
2	78229	He thought it might take a little more effort than it used to .	He could still have her if he wanted .	but
0	126922	He gathered up the reins .	Turned the horse towards the rim road .	and
0	133218	I 'm sitting at my father 's bedside .	He is an old man .	and
3	15723	You 'd be beautiful .	You wore a lot of makeup .	if
0	96803	Her toes pointed at the sky .	She was doing a handstand on the edge .	and
4	84357	His cock jerked in the air .	She immediately put her wrists behind her back .	when
2	68482	His life was better than most .	There was no room for weakness .	but
2	135048	The child was disturbed by the fact that his mother and father seemed so distant with each other .	Then he did not understand it .	but
2	62831	Three more young men approached her for dances .	Each one accepted her polite rejection .	but
0	86434	He raised the muzzle .	Pointed it at me .	and
2	95088	An initial culture had surrendered to the sweeping incursion of another , proclaiming the strength of its stone over the gaudy impermanence of coloured tubes of glass .	Refused to yield its first imprimatur .	but
0	102523	Alexia propped her parasol safely to one side .	Took stock of the situation .	and
2	123198	She felt very self-conscious about her presence among people who not only did not share her faith .	Who believed it to be unnecessarily burdened under a church bureaucracy .	but
3	23111	Then she had time to kill .	As raf had suggested , she was going to leave it a few days before going to the code tower .	if
2	44964	I have a few early business appointments this morning .	I will come over as soon as i can spare the time .	but
2	9994	Some figuring out the past couple of days to understand the different functions .	It seemed to be a good thing to have , especially when driving four hundred or so miles from home .	but
2	43441	He flicked off the lights , and he was too tight to peel off his clothes .	Kicked off his boots .	but
0	109237	They chanted his name .	Bowed before him like some pagan god .	and
1	7328	Zach must have sensed it .	He moved his hand to the small of my back and rested it .	because
0	84641	The heater cycled on for a moment .	The vents inside whispered .	and
3	144928	It will be awkward .	A guard catches us .	if
1	77455	She 's seen me in my underwear a thousand times .	That 's the sight she gets .	because
0	64113	You hurt your wife .	She is in hiding .	and
4	17985	She would extricate herself from the lying game as fast as she could .	This was al over .	when
3	18832	'' damien muttered , stirring his herbal tea after pouring an excessive amount of sugar in it .	I have to hear one more poem about star trek i call riot .	if
2	71608	Risa raised an eyebrow at him .	At his expectant look , she tugged the lid off .	but
4	152932	My whimpers drifting into his mouth .	His lips disengaged from mine and slid across my cheek to my ear .	when
0	90687	When one of you gentlemen got hungry in the night .	Cast a spell for a baked potato .	and
3	21481	We can leave at any time .	You 're not feeling .	if
2	82733	The knuckles whitened even more .	His voice was controlled when he spoke .	but
0	13984	So you 've had her in your powers .	Failed to take her to the oracles .	and
3	113688	The moonkind realized she was honored .	She cared to admit it .	if
0	114145	Within a minute , fire had leapt up to raging proportions within the wooden outlying buildings .	Completely engulfed the leading elements of the vord advance .	and
2	77225	Hed get a dressing-down , of course .	Hed have known that going in .	but
0	55022	He hated it when people took advantage of me .	He hated it more when the person was a man .	and
3	31104	They would have to show themselves in order to throw them .	Even they had grenades .	if
2	153301	Maybe sentiment crept in bartan hadnt heard about an actual tally of the slain .	He had brought them ambaghais last words .	but
4	55808	I said good night to anna and walked through the trees to the spot where my tent was set up .	We arrived at the truck .	when
2	46589	You got ta go gentle .	You got ta get a good result .	but
0	14468	There were only three blond men at the unseelie court .	None of my three uncles lifted weights .	and
0	131304	He looked into his eyes .	Saw that they were glowing bright blue .	and
0	160535	I have some human friends ... but i 've never done more than that .	We go out as a group and hang out .	and
4	4083	The second bell rang .	They arrived at the class room door .	when
1	115919	To pour bleach over the blood in the front yard .	It could be infected .	because
3	129312	As i sauteed onions and garlic for my killer spaghetti , i wondered .	She flashed that sexy smile for everyone or just for me .	if
2	79025	It did pique my curiosity .	I had learned not to press her .	but
0	16241	A row of files occupied a shelf above the desk .	To the right , on the wall , was a large-scale map .	and
3	118117	What would you say .	I told you jack and kaya here had come through the binjin rock from another dreaming .	if
2	159531	We 'll sleep outside , same as ever . '' .	They got a bathhouse here , if any of you feels the need o ' hot water and a lick o ' soap .	but
0	92472	I took a careful sip of the cool liquid .	Closed my eyes briefly : the strong taste brought back old , long buried memories , not all of them bad .	and
4	86037	That even the most outlandish dime novels about matthew 's familys exploits were sedate .	Compared to the real life events on which they were based .	when
1	127171	`` you have a problem ? '' .	He 's not white .	because
0	83371	Coursa took another step .	Turned to face her .	and
0	31108	Trevor let go of the branch .	Landed the same way .	and
2	16316	I liked it and .	Wanted to see where this thing with us could lead .	but
2	59591	She could hurt their feelings , she saw .	Not alter their purpose .	but
4	85822	Maybe our yelling might have woken up the entire duplex .	I heard cooper from beside him .	when
2	61879	She liked the town better than the country .	When she turned up pregnant and the big men would have nothing to do with her .	but
4	20	He 'd shown them just how much of a devil he could be .	The drug finally wore .	when
3	67221	Agmar , shaking his head , well be lucky .	They let us in at all .	if
2	72123	He pinned it under his arm against his body , stepping .	The pain made him weak and clumsy .	but
0	157721	She felt a tug at the bottom of her new shirt .	She saw a smoking hole in the loose folds around her waist .	and
3	148811	And the place probably would have been closed .	It had been a regular joint .	if
0	87346	If i had simply pumped the shotgun , the spent shell would have ejected , another would have chambered .	I would still have him .	and
2	11364	Her mom had never been completely sane .	On the days she was lucid , this was the one thing she drilled into lexi 's head over and over , and lexi took that warning to heart .	but
0	48184	I sighed closed my eyes , wishing the wind could whip my troubles away as easily as it tangled my hair .	Put my head back on the seat .	and
1	3142	When i squared off against wolfe for the last time , it was .	He had held the entire city of minneapolis hostage , leaving a trail of dead bodies until i came out of hiding and faced him .	because
2	17566	Not just to thwart the assassin .	Also to give all of us time to accomplish our tasks .	but
0	148767	He ignored the call .	Took her hand as he continued to steer .	and
4	67123	He really was something .	He turned on the full wattage of that smile .	when
1	46799	You 'll be the star of the litigation rookies , seven days a week , and you 'll suck up and kiss ass and backstab and do all the right things it takes to succeed in a big law firm .	You 're the brightest and you 'll work eighteen hours a day .	because
4	95261	I anticipated sitting up in a hospital bed , iv in my arm , both of my parents at my bedside .	I said i wanted this to stop .	when
2	154891	That is not specified .	Should be used primary for building and or transportation .	but
4	71990	Athaliah was twenty three .	She heard that her father was killed in a battle against the arameans .	when
2	29837	It was a dilemma that he knew was looming .	Hoped that hed never have to finally face the choice between raw emotions and ethics , what his heart told him or his head and david was making him confront it .	but
0	129998	Her husband touched her chin with gentle fingers .	She looked up at him .	and
0	50266	I 'm sorry , bobo .	You tell lem we said .	and
2	71222	We do not advocate or we do try to use it to the best of our ability .	In any way support the evil of the many planes of existence .	but
0	104940	The sound was deafening , even where they crouched .	Amara desperately shifted some of cirrus 's effort into shielding their ears from the terrible din .	and
4	73528	I realized i was trembling .	He turned his eyes to me .	when
2	158743	Ryan sighed , ruffling the hair that flopped over his eyes .	Then he turned to me and smiled .	but
2	5425	She wanted to scold him .	Was feeling too tired and out of breath at that instant .	but
2	61135	Raine would far rather have liam touch her .	He 'd given her a direct order .	but
0	113263	It had been a good hour since leaving the square , settled in whatever cell they 'd picked out for her .	Ivy was probably in there by .	and
2	12398	Yeah , it was , '' i agreed .	My energy was nowhere near the level of sara 's .	but
4	91086	Getting the drift , she threw it out of the chopper .	Chambers did no more than wave the barrel of the m-4 at the co-pilot 's still-open door .	when
1	36824	He cancelled his phone .	Sam must be okay .	because
4	28842	It had been difficult enough , her legs buckled beneath her .	She took a step .	when
2	97006	Lewis had a lot of secrets , and she was drawn to his power , if nothing .	He 'd always been intrigued by rahel .	but
2	97063	He wanted desperately to return to arianna , to question her .	He had a feeling that no matter what had passed between them , she still would not tell him about her family .	but
0	102398	Who this guy is .	Let 's stop him .	and
2	54085	@ o'neill ran from the house .	The uproar had alerted richard who burst into chacuti 's room .	but
3	154227	Getting this side , thus loosening it from the wall .	Wed just wiggled the grate back and .	if
2	73324	The policeman seemed to ponder on this for a short time , eyeing each of them seriously , scratching his chin with a thumb .	Then he smiled , his eyes crinkling , giving him a welcome friendly appearance .	but
0	123742	Alluvias beauty rivaled rafulls .	Had constantly felt the strain of jealousy whenever hed heard comments of what a handsome couple they would make .	and
2	148572	He was unnervingly calm , and .	It was destroying what little of her nerves were left .	but
2	41642	I didnt want to think it .	I couldnt stop myself .	but
2	68450	I wanted to protest .	I remained silent because he was .	but
4	74207	Not long ago sir horace had a bad experience at water wonderland .	Old morris fitzmaurice put him in a wheelbarrow and locked him in the keep .	when
4	2917	But the absolute worst had come .	Cliff had mistakenly drunk from tabitha 's cup , which had been filled with her strength potion of curdled milk , tabasco sauce , egg yolks , and tea leaves .	when
0	84873	You put food to his lips .	Prod the corner of his mouth .	and
3	102960	Then i dont know what else to say to you .	You are not willing to acknowledge that we have something special and fight for it for all youre worth .	if
2	25110	Bogis spat , scraped his tongue with his teeth , and spat again with no thought of those who were .	He could hear that he wasnt the only one to do .	but
2	72194	The image was fuzzy .	There was no mistaking those perfect features or pure emerald eyes .	but
4	8208	I stepped back so she could stand .	She pressed her hands to my chest .	when
2	48635	It would be suicide .	It also might not be .	but
2	132092	Macy had been late for our first meeting .	She 'd made a point of letting me know she 'd been on time ever since , as if this was some impressive achievement .	but
0	83801	It is much more fun with wanda .	I found two ghosts .	and
0	22373	The memory of his kiss flashed through her head .	She felt a little guilty about sharing it with miranda and della .	and
1	5520	The old sidney wouldnt have dumped her friends because of it .	She was once like us , remember .	because
2	102548	Asked if i could go .	The nurse told me i had to wait .	but
3	45123	She doubted , but she would try .	She could resist ken norton if he made sexual advances toward her .	if
3	95705	Odds are he came out through one of the doors .	The huntsman went in .	if
0	8630	We walk down the remainder of the stairs , still not sure whether my grandpa was being paranoid .	I peer out the lobby doors .	and
2	11790	I had no idea of what that upstart looked like .	I just hoped that he crossed the road in front of me so that i could run him down - several times .	but
2	77179	His heart pounded in his throat .	He felt no secondary flare of pain .	but
2	44581	Dasen 's first thought was that the thing was some kind of small bear because its entire body was covered with oily black fur .	The creature had the build , clothing , and weapons of a man .	but
3	15876	You think too highly of yourself . '' .	You believe i deny you for the simple pleasure of it .	if
3	156617	He 'd be yellin ' .	All right he tried that sort of thing round .	if
2	34763	The effect is too small to be noticed .	Insects can walk on water surfaces because of it .	but
4	31682	Where ... all the tourists come .	They visit schramm hall .	when
2	141040	He hadnt noticed before how warm the weather was that day .	He was noticing it .	but
3	109460	That , so who knew .	He 'd been telling the truth or had just been trying to get on her good side .	if
2	47078	I noticed the soldiers had also started toward me .	It was clear the arm bands would get first crack at me .	but
2	45831	For a moment she thought he was tempted to come in .	Instead he said : no , wed better get on the road , the others will be there before me as it is .	but
0	2070	A nasty little thought struck up .	Rhyllann couldnt sit still any longer .	and
0	54212	Gasping , he threw the sword .	Fell to his knees .	and
3	21892	The entire future of the human race can be changed .	The cells can be grafted and replicate themselves in other human bodies .	if
4	92462	People hold them up and offer different toasts or just say some version of cheers .	All our paper cups have been filled .	when
0	99374	This was a nice place .	Some idiot was strewing garbage around .	and
3	132613	She 'd wake up back in her four-poster bed in her tasteful , understated apartment in chicago .	Maybe she clicked her heels three times .	if
0	34784	Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth .	When he looked up from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead .	and
4	13525	Followed by two separate half hours .	He 'd left her to do the same and then take care of other details .	when
4	56718	How it was just in times like these .	Everything was at stake , when a multitude of issues and problems seemed to overwhelm her that he would comfort her , and be the pillar of strength she had come to depend on .	when
2	80204	She did not look at it .	Her annoyance was evident .	but
2	96556	He glanced back toward the empty torch holder .	Another flaming torch was burning .	but
1	137549	To turn off the energy bubble of your hickoop , eddy .	In the vacuum of space we will only have the air which we go in there with .	because
4	49723	Emma 's chest clenched as she was enveloped by a mixture of both happy and painful memories .	They turned on aidan 's street .	when
0	130782	He scooped marcy around the middle , slamming the door firmly behind him .	Pounded out of the room .	and
2	83979	Yeltsin and his successors had tried to raise the fare .	The public furor was so great they 'd all backed .	but
0	60911	Postmaster atkinson was only five feet one . ' .	It made him look broody .	and
2	74498	He may look meek .	That would be where it ended .	but
4	145449	Morgan held her ground .	He took another step toward her .	when
4	18794	He scrubbed his hand over his mouth .	His eyes met hers .	when
0	99669	She stared at me .	I could tell she was thinking something but wasnt sure if she wanted to ask .	and
3	63830	Youd see that she doesnt really look to be fighting him off .	You would bother to check .	if
2	94235	I know that she probably wanted to avoid conflict .	How could she be crazy about someone who had been so rude to me .	but
0	105930	He had been a great comfort to her .	She didnt want to jeopardize their potentially budding friendship .	and
0	68007	Piper had made amanda a mother .	She was used to her constant , quiet presence .	and
2	12644	Had he just said what i 'd known for so long .	Tried to ignore during the past few weeks with josie .	but
2	97194	At you she smiled at me .	I didnt hear the joke .	but
0	10594	She 'll only be paralyzed .	You can be changing her bedpans and apologizing to her the rest of your life .	and
2	32416	To say , `` .	This lighthouse has been in the property of alberto palomino for many years .	but
3	72538	It would ruin me and perhaps doomba .	Such a thing happened .	if
3	96086	At least id only talk to him .	Id gone to his shop or , perhaps one day , run into him in the grocery store , or something like that .	if
4	54011	It felt very good .	The time came for the children to be dismissed to sunday school .	when
4	93147	I realized that maybe i should be .	I saw those shadows moving in the distance .	when
2	40848	A survivor tried to signal to him .	Then a rifle bullet struck him in the face at the right side of his jaw .	but
2	14784	He 's still a bit nervous .	I imagine he 'll set his mind to it .	but
0	57305	The man did not seem happy about the abruptness of the move , but the glance was well worth it .	The spear dug into his back .	and
3	32417	It would gain speed in the downhill turns coming into town and i would run off the road .	I didnt stop the car .	if
3	42251	The rattling , overworked motor managed to provide a faint puff of cool air in the otherwise stifling room but the ice cream in the freezer had melted .	He stood right in front of it .	if
3	10636	Then i hope you understand that i think we need to give this a little more time .	You 're really thinking .	if
1	56420	The trollocs had paused their climb , many of whom had been cut down by tam 's archers .	They needed to move corpses out of their way on the slope .	because
2	60903	She tried to seduce me , i started .	Was cut off by a collective utterance of annoyances .	but
1	36507	The last time coby got behind on his bills , it was .	He was sinking his entire paycheck into steroids .	because
2	18283	He had no choice to acknowledge that the culprit was , indeed , one of his friends : charles .	It was not , and .	but
2	54686	Denial worked for a while .	The time for that had expired .	but
0	148451	Her eyes were red .	Her nose was a little puffy .	and
3	53296	Later , we wondered .	We could have helped them escape .	if
1	27114	But here and now , it mattered less than it once had .	She somehow suspected that alex understood hershame .	because
2	45324	Touch them and we can send images with our minds .	They wont be able to hear anything .	but
4	66125	Then turned her away and let her walk out the door .	He 'd made her strip .	when
0	74507	It was quite terrifying uh , relieved myself earlier because i believe i mightve done .	I was somewhat relieved id .	and
0	155151	Eventually , the bullets popped one by one from erron 's skin .	Rolled to the bedspread .	and
2	36048	Says we hafta bring our own food for most of the time .	Theyre bringing hot dogs and sodas for the lunch on sunday .	but
2	90921	The danger is not making something .	Trying to sell it .	but
0	61781	Its doors first opened collecting ten times his tab under the table for acting as chrysalis 's eyes and ears in the cophouse .	Paying for every drink in a rather ostentatious show of rectitude .	and
2	161	Katelyn didnt realize her eyes were closed .	She had automatically pinched them shut as the engine had passed over her head .	but
0	153312	I got to my closet .	Immediately realized why itd been two years since my last date .	and
3	95620	I 'd drain her dry .	I cared enough to .	if
0	72475	Without hesitation she cocked her arm .	Slugged him in the shoulder as hard as she was able .	and
2	129923	After she returned home , she wondered if he 'd come for her , as he 'd said he would .	As the night ripened , she was further burdened with uncertainty .	but
0	146700	If i did that , they might want to talk .	We really needed to warn the demi-fey .	and
2	73755	We help each other blend in , you could use a little more training in that area .	Dont worry you are pretty good at it .	but
3	72721	Then they want you to do something violent so they can have you locked up .	They are trying to trick you .	if
0	79454	Jazz slammed her forehead into susannah 's bloody nose almost effortlessly flipped her .	Grabbed her knife hand .	and
2	93941	Aeniah hammered at it .	The wall sealing the archway off was too firm .	but
3	70539	Matter of fact , id be doing you a disservice .	I didnt do something about it .	if
0	110257	Pierce 's door shut a moment behind mine .	I smiled at him over the car .	and
4	79964	Mercifully , my father home-grown philosophy was cut .	His cell phone began twittering .	when
0	135154	Go get foss , or tribune an-tillar or antillus . '' .	Have them do a truthfinding on me .	and
2	67271	For a moment , he caught a glimpse of a tall sufi participant carrying a celebratory horn .	Then he is gone in the confusion .	but
0	2879	What was true prophecy .	What was just the ravings of a mad woman .	and
2	128782	Used to think my brother was an exaggerator .	After all id seen , i knew the stories were true .	but
0	104145	Denise lifted a crimson-painted hand .	Vaguely pointed at the wall behind her .	and
0	61353	Melaina was platinum blond .	Controlled the west fork .	and
0	20876	He raised his voice on the last sentence .	There was an even louder roar of approval from the assembled men .	and
2	103956	It is , darling .	I 'm not f**king around with a fuse box at midnight .	but
2	72809	He walks to my chair .	I stop him before he can bend and pick me up .	but
0	285	She shuffled the curling papers into a pile .	Looked at aunt eustacia , who continued .	and
0	148028	All the lanterns and candles were blazing .	It seemed to be full of people .	and
0	152582	Rodneys right leg was flopped over the edge .	Dragging in the water .	and
2	42279	She might have entered this weekend planning to keep her heart safe and her legs spread .	Along the way , something had happened .	but
0	117480	It would take days for the letter to get there , must i remind you of that .	The high priest and his family have more on their minds than the goings-on in this town .	and
2	36750	She yelled , all too aware of what it meant .	Her voice was unable to penetrate the darkness .	but
3	53937	`` ... '' i started to say .	I went with you .	if
1	15808	I was educated on how to get the girl .	I had done it so many times .	because
2	73547	Hunter opened his mouth to respond .	Gwen beat him to it .	but
4	140976	Two years ago prince doran 's gout had not been half so bad .	They had left sunspear for the peace and isolation of the water gardens .	when
2	108982	We came here to do some shopping and visit friends .	Someone , he nudged ifaut , got carried .	but
3	92496	Then he 'd be free .	He could track down sweet dove and kill her .	if
2	128044	The next day , piper went to school and it was .	Tried to concentrate on her lessons .	but
3	147969	Well , then you 're .	The klingon home world is directly behind saturn .	if
4	120237	It took a few seconds for my pupils to adjust , but when they did , i saw danny standing over me .	I opened my eyes .	when
0	97689	Then he released one hip .	Slapped his hand across her ass .	and
2	40518	He loved his new career .	Loved me , more .	but
2	116944	There 's his famous sketches of fireworks and they 're in leipzig , germany . '' .	They 're not sculpture .	but
4	23980	I dont hear anything .	I put my ear up to the door .	when
0	101434	To leave with the container .	Friedrich says , that has to stay in .	and
1	143480	You must never give up .	To give up is to die .	because
4	60705	Things done my way .	I wanted , where i wanted .	when
2	103391	I was going to hire someone from the institute to cast a spell from it for me .	Then i found out about my friend .	but
4	7202	The judge was nervous .	He walked into the courtroom .	when
0	12540	Pushed those strong fingers between her legs .	Made her hips strain toward him as he strummed the center of her need .	and
2	59779	Ethan reached out and , breaking it more cleanly than donatelli had done to alexis snapping it in three pieces .	Yanked donatelli 's wrist .	but
1	122963	He 'd found her to be over the phone .	She was as sexy and ballsy .	because
0	97221	Lurking in the shadows .	Never make so much as a squeak .	and
3	154633	And , if he even twitches , you hit him as hard as you can with this .	Tyler starts to wake up .	if
4	107293	I ask , `` do you think we 'll make it , caleb .	My lips are a whisper away from his .	when
2	78050	I 'd have never guessed it of him .	Some men will turn into idiots around a woman as beautiful as lin .	but
2	45899	He kept it firmly under control in front of stuyvesant because of sensitivity issues .	He threw up every kind of obstacle he could find .	but
0	147685	He slipped an arm around her waist .	She leaned against him for a moment .	and
0	95417	Laylen glanced at alex , who shot him a dirty look .	Returned his bright blue eyes on me .	and
0	158244	They returned to their places .	Wondered what exactly had just taken place .	and
0	7600	His outstretched hand twisted .	Appeared to scoop a piece of darkness from the shadows of the square .	and
2	33079	Suddenly , she saw his lips move a huge clap of thunder drowned out the words .	Saw the demand for information in his eyes .	but
4	53248	I 'm just picturing the poor man 's face .	He got a hint of rachel 's temper .	when
2	39215	She was afraid to say what she really thought - listen , i love you .	Did it ever occur to you that your role in this was only to see that i returned , that i remained , and that i have a child to inherit the legacy .	but
4	99915	She was close , nearly pressed against him .	He returned from his thoughts .	when
2	86871	You may not believe it .	We helped each other .	but
2	51931	Kanin is our sire , and . '' .	We 're the only ones i know of who have a chance of finding him .	but
4	13202	Then , the manager at the time said it wasnt funny .	I laughed at them .	when
0	108651	She and i have identical hooves .	Just earned enough points to apply for her own set by celestia last year .	and
2	54809	Julie missed the exchange .	Ted saw it and so did carl .	but
4	88911	What happened in afghanistan behind me .	I got out of the marines .	when
0	118111	I could reach across time and space .	Punch roland in the face .	and
3	160422	We could be at war much sooner than anticipated .	They find out that the terrans have violated the taisa accord .	if
4	38271	The air was frigid .	I opened the car door .	when
0	159560	As if reluctant to cause damage to the envelope , calvin broke the seal .	Pulled out the pages .	and
2	156223	The result was chaos .	I was able to accomplish what i set out to do .	but
3	136566	I would appreciate it .	You could have it on for the return journey .	if
4	152088	I grabbed my shirt and headed for the door .	I started hearing shane 's groans .	when
0	89577	The problem was with me .	How my mind kept roaming back to derek .	and
2	52642	Thought i had left it behind in the states right next to my fear , like it had been a dusty piece of century-old electronics mummified on a shelf in some museum .	It followed me across the pacific , ghosting me like a nightmare program crawling along on a fiber optic cable that didnt want to let me go .	but
4	121918	She began to feel relaxed .	She 'd finished half her beer .	when
0	83416	His arms curved around me .	Looked up at him .	and
2	127986	He pulled his moms car over .	Kept the engine running .	but
0	37218	He shook his head .	Gave a reassuring smile .	and
1	74041	It 's worth killing an animal .	You prefer your belt made of animal skin instead of something man-made .	because
0	114694	That was the longest logs he could get on the wagon .	The horses could only pull ten at a time for the three miles he had to carry them overland from the lost pines .	and
4	6013	For all the wisecracks that came from that big mouth of his , he knew .	To keep it shut .	when
0	45099	She folded the stiff parchment .	She set the letter beneath a leather book on the table , much smaller than the volumes left at the house .	and
2	62614	None of the other vampires looked eager to follow that order .	They all turned to face nikolas , preparing to rush him all at .	but
1	132241	Where i was going .	I had no place to go .	because
2	26093	The first carriage had just arrived .	Was too large to fit through the gate .	but
2	53060	Yes , he thought , khalid murat would surely have handled the situation differently , and this was why .	Khalid murat was dead and he , hasan arsenov , the architect of murat 's demise , was alive and in charge .	but
1	83272	'' axel said between sips .	All of a sudden , for no reason , he 's decided to track me down .	because
4	77703	I thought i was in for a wallop .	You saw i poked a hole in the bag .	when
1	89219	Hiding her movements under the table lest her mom throw out her phone .	She was fanatical about table manners-lord .	because
0	130888	The meeting with the council of superiors had gone on into evening .	Since he wasnt hungryit occurred to him now that he might have scared away the individual charged with bringing him his mealit was either cry himself to sleep thinking about renmyr or find something to distract him at least a little .	and
1	27160	That must not have been enough to give her a good look .	She shifted , and rose up on her knees next to me .	because
0	2849	So every day he rose before father sun and led seebtok and atlatla into the jungle .	Prepared his spear and his knife .	and
2	133507	I never get motion sick .	I do get nauseous when im nervousor afraid .	but
2	59678	Josh would be a comfort .	He is a little annoying .	but
0	43306	She entered the slums .	Crept along , careful to keep her head bowed .	and
4	117839	She reluctantly stood , and he bowed first to her , then to the curtain .	The candle reached the half hour mark .	when
2	112207	When she goes into labor , you will follow her to the hospital .	You are not to confront her under any circumstances .	but
1	125611	The cellular circuits are jammed .	Everyone is on their cell phone in this area , trying to check on their loved ones .	because
3	25526	Then you are disrespectful .	You dont agree with someone older than you .	if
3	82024	And he had been with her since hed turned seventeen , he had had sex with four different girls in only two years .	He was fifteen the first time .	if
0	26540	Absorbing the fall on bent knees .	Rolling to a stop .	and
0	157978	Holding stacks of napkins .	Carrying pitchers of water , lemonade , and sweet iced tea .	and
0	152961	She reached up behind her to unclasp the bra , then after a few seconds of maneuvering dropped it on the counter .	Pulled it out one of her sleeves .	and
1	116600	It was a marvel to her .	Clint 's own arm was a mass of torn shirt fabric and dripping blood .	because
0	124583	A pair of scuffed boots appeared in front of me .	Sam scooted a chair over and sat down directly in front of me , blocking me from view .	and
2	21402	I 'm in such a great mood .	Shay 's text had been a bit of a wet blanket .	but
2	91199	Used to be able to do it myself when the life-light was strong .	Now it is a skill that escapes me .	but
3	38023	I will find out where we may go to find safety .	You will wait here for a few minutes .	if
2	74223	They want a quick cuddle between sets .	It usually leaves the little one crying .	but
2	4153	Duke had more than earned a lashing .	His son did not deserve to see any of that .	but
3	119795	We knew we had him for certain .	He struck tonight in caracas or its environs .	if
0	55008	Shannon and i ate in silence .	As we finished , he straightened in his chair .	and
0	112668	Dad stared at him for a few long seconds .	Then his face broke out into a smile .	and
2	4921	Azalea could tell that her nails were pierced into his skin .	He was still as emotionless as .	but
0	1271	Spade let out a low hiss .	Someone muttered something that sounded like a prayer .	and
2	148083	If not kept in check , life tended to get out of control .	Properly tended , it thrived and bloomed .	but
2	18104	All the other girls left cynthia heres been a little godsend ; does the work of two others , doesnt mind staying over .	Claimed they were being worked to .	but
0	148519	The sun had gone .	There was a slight chill in the air .	and
0	55045	Keep whinging . '' .	I 'll make you wait until i 'm done before you have her .	and
2	72166	I almost said to him .	I was too busy potting balls , before sending the black into the bottom right corner pocket .	but
4	85952	Who lost twenty iq points .	A charming guy smiled .	when
4	129561	Major ferguson turned back to speak with general cornwallis .	The tent was empty .	when
4	59902	The high demons had spared no expense and it was beautiful .	The palace was built .	when
2	7976	They seemed more shocked than frightened .	Where i knew we could take them in a fight , they didnt seem so sure .	but
0	30039	He , d bought a hot sandwich and soda on the way home .	He devoured these impatiently , googling `` werewolves , '' `` werewolf legends , '' `` werewolf movies , '' and a host of other such subjects with his right hand .	and
0	148525	`` you could get your name in a lot of history books , narasan , '' padan said then , `` . '' .	You 'd probably send the church of amar up in flames if it became known that you 'd enlisted a woman to serve in your army .	and
0	83507	But she was made of stern stuff .	She cried in the night , by daylight she was resolute to live life as if it still had some promise to it .	and
0	148987	They had just started to spar when della shot out of her bedroom , eyes aglow .	Looked at kylie holding up the sword .	and
2	147515	If hed looked up at that moment , he might have seen several self-satisfied smiles from faces among the assembly .	He was busy keeping his drink from being jostled and not aware of the speculative glances .	but
4	15635	Mercandetti was polite but unengaged .	He learned of ben 's immediate concerns .	when
0	139084	I had to find the baby before henry found me .	I had to find henry before it was too late .	and
0	19026	The bracelet immediately began radiating a soft golden luminescence .	She felt herself connecting with garys subconscious .	and
2	157192	Had leveled them to the west .	Was a forty-foot thicket that could have been growing there since the dawn of time .	but
4	102695	On the morrow , we shall look upon each other .	The sun is new .	when
2	30605	With a regretful moan in my throat , i stepped towards the dumpster .	Stopped as my foot kicked something metallic into my line of sight .	but
2	74162	Some of the buildings were tall , mimicking the other buildings currently surrounding them .	Most were small , being only large enough to accommodate a small family or group .	but
0	13005	She lifted an arm , gasping , halting the blade a scant inch from her throat .	Blocked the marat 's forearm with her own .	and
0	6178	Even though we left early , it still took us forty minutes to drive to school .	There was already an egregiously long line of luxury cars waiting to pull into the entrance .	and
3	104766	It was difficult to see them .	You didnt know they were there .	if
4	123246	Want to take his hand and hold it .	She did reach to touch him .	when
1	99466	He had managed to get into holm 's machine ; any time of the day or night he could go in and access whatever he was working on .	It had an open line to his desk at work .	because
2	16965	He had tried to warn jon .	Al-hassan had sent maddux after jon in washington before jon even had a chance to think about running .	but
2	156038	My jaw drops open .	I should have expected this .	but
4	101809	Killed at the battle of shrewsbury .	He lifted his visor to get some fresh air and was hit in the mouth by an arrow .	when
3	75929	We could share custody .	I decided to take that route .	if
0	18304	Today the hunters are gathering .	The bison are falling prey to the hunger of their spears .	and
4	118262	No one could fault her devotion to her .	It came to watching our basketball games all these years with dad .	when
0	18264	Both were saddled ome had three more , all loaded with large wicker baskets that were overflowing with market goods .	She wasnt sure , but .	and
4	139545	Sigzil made an excuse about being tired .	Moash asked him what was wrong .	when
0	120060	He followed wyzer to the rear of the pharmacy .	Stood in the doorway of an office not much bigger than a public-toilet cubicle while wyzer sat on the only piece of furniture-a high stool that would have looked at home in ebenezer scrooge 's counting-house and phoned the office of james roy heng , acupuncturist .	and
0	82206	I held the crone 's hand .	Felt safe , completely and utterly safe , as if nothing could ever disturb this sense of quiet peace .	and
0	10043	As for facing all of the lies and deceptions cursed-king had orchestrated around me during his quest for the artifact , there were simply too many to count .	It was now a moot point .	and
0	133721	She ducked under his arm , but she could hear the thud of his footsteps as he followed her and she knew .	Raced down the tunnel .	and
4	67548	He 'd crossed the room to her on shaky legs , pulling her into his arms and taking a moment to absorb the feel of her soft body against his .	He stormed into the house and saw ava looking unharmed next to brant and emma .	when
4	121415	He cleared his throat and looked at the doctor .	He saw a bottle of anti-bacterial lotion in johns hand .	when
2	47991	Joshua tried a philips-head screwdriver .	The flat-head managed to turn each rusty , cold hinge , nine all together on one side .	but
0	69756	She was now held by four afterlights .	Put into handcuffs that had come to the vortex from one blast zone or another .	and
1	107681	That often lay at half-mast .	Pleasure had taken him over .	because
4	11893	They rushed in and , as one detective hit the lobby button , the other held up his hand to markman and said , weve got this .	The doors of the second elevator finally opened .	when
2	139351	Hoping for the relief of sleep still none came .	He turned over and tried to close his eyes again , and he began to wonder if he would ever sleep again or if worry and strife would follow him for the rest of his life .	but
3	6383	It felt , as if she would never again know joy or happiness or anything good .	Her beating heart had been ripped from her chest .	if
0	25788	He turned his head to the side .	Felt an ache in his neck .	and
4	154212	After canvassing members opinions members would be discreetly advised when entering , that someone was being polled as a prospective member that night .	A vote was to take place .	when
1	22276	We might sacrifice a few .	We are stupid and hardwired for group survival .	because
1	108695	The video of liz smacking him in the manager 's office had spread like the flu should .	It meant that the greatest fighter ever still respected his mother like a good mongol .	because
2	123635	No part of him was touching me .	I felt his gaze as a caress .	but
0	57896	He was disgusting had .	Made her feel dirtier than several days in the desert without a shower .	and
0	11315	He knew a little about damnation himself .	He had an idea that the lessons , far from being done , were just beginning .	and
4	142853	A lightness tingled through her body .	She was done with the whole story .	when
3	83306	Kefa spoke up bring them with you .	You have to go more than a mile or two from your children .	if
3	155642	She asked me . '' .	She could design the interior of the new hotels .	if
2	85177	I 'm trying not to be nervous .	The way he 's talking makes me shake a little .	but
0	13493	So i dug out a bottle of pain reliever .	Swallowed a couple tablets with tap water .	and
0	116879	It was a simple thing to remove the shelves .	They soon found themselves at the southwest end of the south hallway , right before the master bedroom door .	and
4	95401	She 'd come home in tears .	The guy 's fiancee interrupted their dinner .	when
0	41176	This far north , it was cold even in summer ; the biochip on his canteen reported nothing more alarming than trace arsenic .	The water was chill and clear .	and
0	76990	She pressed the woman down into the dubious shelter between two crates , pressed them over the woman 's mouth .	Then lifted odiana 's own hands .	and
0	40497	They returned the gesture ( all but valentine .	Moved through the door .	and
3	14834	It could threaten them .	I put it together with other facts .	if
3	93441	Conor knew that devin would wish for a simpler , more durable coat .	Caught in a storm .	if
4	90654	Jim put it around her waist .	They lowered the harness .	when
3	95272	But , that 's what they would look like .	He was to have some .	if
3	28249	Chances were he 'd go to prison and never see emma .	He went after vince , if he had to take matters into his own hands .	if
3	54362	I see someone else i would like to speak with .	You 'll excuse me .	if
4	1320	Them full they could hold if there was food to be had .	We were going to be doing any long flying .	when
0	109179	The bars are set into the wall on both sides .	Each bar is locked in place .	and
4	15633	She did not look at me .	She did at last respond .	when
1	135869	There was no other way .	If aiden knew , he would stop it , and then the world would go to crap .	because
0	120153	She picked up the chair .	Brought it around the desk .	and
0	108912	A moment later , he grunted as if someone had punched him in the belly . '' .	Said , `` time to place our bets .	and
2	155358	It 's a dick move .	I 'm hoping he brushes it off to me getting in the zone .	but
0	85843	He 's extremely intelligent .	He 's an excellent teacher .	and
3	51152	`` so he still might not find her ? '' .	Even hafer could move heaven and earth .	if
4	67915	He seemed distracted , his words disjointed .	Peter spoke after a moment .	when
0	160528	A sad smile came across her lips .	She lowered her hand into the water , just brushing the surface .	and
2	136345	I manage to whisper .	I 'm not as good at this as he is .	but
2	134598	Ask for that much coming .	Dared to hope for blue sky .	but
4	32209	To see the light of day .	I felt garrett moving on top of me .	when
0	51905	Gently she pried the window with her knife where the paint had sealed it shut .	Followed it with oil .	and
0	137372	There was a faint but desperate squeaking sound .	Then the little grille over the plughole was pushed aside and a rat plunged out .	and
1	60336	I smiled warmly at him .	I really meant it .	because
4	62816	It felt like a furnace .	He opened the door .	when
2	38195	Nick told me , kylee and cutty told us everything i wasnt sure what he meant .	I knew it wasnt gon na be good .	but
3	128081	I know it 'll come .	I let you drive .	if
4	127960	My fingers have already tapped out an excuse .	I think better of it .	when
0	770	There was a doorman scanning ids through a computer .	Verifying they were on the guest list .	and
2	118171	They know that these fights are taking a toll on him .	They could never guess what the price of this next match will be .	but
0	153970	She turned right instead of left , in the direction of her stupid hand .	Walked down the hill .	and
1	104962	This thought sent a shiver through me .	Their behavior had become eerily similar to ours .	because
4	88800	The same had happened , he realized .	He was a boy and the bloody black flesh had been placed upon his naked body .	when
2	107585	Miller 's expression was still friendly .	There was a dread in it .	but
0	11567	Captain luccio , however , had been in a lot more scrapes than that .	Was faster and better than me .	and
0	81904	He could hold his own in a brawl , he thought nervously , as they traversed yet another square , this one with a sluggish fountain in it .	Then came to a quarter of the city that was even more rundown than the last .	and
2	28334	Our genes might control the possibilities .	Epigenetics determines our destiny .	but
2	12458	`` you know , you can throw the biggest party in the world , '' professes tony as he continues down the road .	Nothing brings people together quite like death .	but
4	88549	But , she turns and runs away , disappearing into one of the dark gothic passages .	He gets close enough for her to see his face .	when
2	48202	He would then be empty-hearted as well as empty-handed , alarmed him .	He ignored the warning and tightened his hold , nodding for shane to proceed .	but
3	135016	It was his business .	York wanted to get all upset about a little sleep .	if
1	148847	Did you really kiss me a few minutes ago ? '' .	You were driven into a paroxysm of violent passion by the close confines and threat of incredible danger that we face .	because
2	115985	You have your business interests to occupy your daylight hours .	Your private hours are mine .	but
0	11274	To take the prince around the camp .	Introduce him to some of what he called the lads .	and
3	103141	To keep most mothers happy .	Even the boys complained about the quantities of cabbage and greens they were forced to eat .	if
2	97533	Lauren , i know this is a little late .	Will you marry me .	but
3	134307	That is . '' .	You 're truly interested , and not just jesting .	if
1	14376	His hair was gray and silver , and it was cut too long in the back and mr. stockton liked making people uncomfortable .	It made people uncomfortable that his hair was .	because
0	75464	He 'd tried to reach thomas 's mind .	He 'd made contact , right before a guard had blasted a bullet into the guy 's head .	and
2	49250	They promised first-class transport .	Sent him a ticket for substeerage .	but
0	159338	To return home with it .	Persuade the priest to seek a new place to hide it .	and
4	107288	I hear a lot .	We go to bed at night .	when
4	68989	It swaying around my shoulders .	You are thrusting deep inside of me .	when
0	90574	Clary looked up in surprise .	Saw him staring blankly at the tv .	and
3	113875	He 'll keep her close . '' .	He thinks she 's a target .	if
2	79898	The door looked like all the others .	To her , it seethed with power .	but
0	144175	David stripped off underwear turned back to the glass .	Dropped them on the pile .	and
2	41685	He started to say something .	Then closed his mouth .	but
4	88644	But , summer has walked right by me multiple times throughout the night without saying a word .	I think about it .	when
4	78973	Dredging up the past .	They 'd all moved on .	when
2	110022	Kori also realized this .	She didnt say anything .	but
0	57110	It tugged , gently , on the chain , pulling it out from under door 's layers of silk and cotton and lace , revealing the silver key .	Then it ran its fingers over the key , as if it were exploring her secret places .	and
0	109593	Talmanes hesitated , took a long swallow .	Then took the flask .	and
0	12569	Sabelle opened her eyes .	Turned her head to meet his stare .	and
3	138330	You tell me . ' .	I 'm interested or .	if
0	67970	She locked the door .	Made her way over to the renovated stable/apartment .	and
4	60541	So wagons had room to park .	They brought straw in or night soil .	when
2	131722	Admittedly clive was a little forlorn from time to time .	Everything else around the apartment was great .	but
2	131628	She could go ahead and .	Leave because i got you from here on .	but
1	78389	So i have no option than going by my self .	I knew ill be late if i dont go within 15 minutes or .	because
3	105476	Forty should be the new seventeen-which at least would expand my dating options . '' .	We 're really going to start messing around with the aging process .	if
3	16688	That was all she got .	The past few tumultuous minutes counted as foreplay .	if
0	129136	Turn back . '' .	Return to where you came from .	and
3	133975	He might soon be a father .	Even it was a little early .	if
0	122201	He stretched out on one of the cots he shut his eyes .	Smoothed out his beard .	and
0	114692	The collision knocked him off his feet .	He landed on his arse in the mud .	and
0	56761	Her black hair was shorn .	Her pink lacey dress was in tatters .	and
2	119323	He 'd arrived empty handed , and i guess it was something more than nothing .	I 'm not sure what i expected .	but
4	20047	Is forcibly removed , its function is not wholly taken over by any other .	A dominant class , however badly it has performed its function .	when
4	140680	`` but a day may well come . '' .	I have to bite you to inoculate you against vampirism .	when
2	125876	It 's a childish tactic .	It buys me some time as march shakes his head , glares at me , and throws a sloppy roundhouse .	but
0	97655	Him go , by force of will , on the still intact right leg .	Rolled back to standing .	and
2	59072	She needed to eat .	Nothing appealed and the thought of having to prepare anything was more than she could deal with at the moment .	but
0	75857	The young shepherd 's heart was now beating .	He felt awash in a cloud of uncertainty .	and
3	117093	Who is there left in asturia to read calendars with such interest ? ' .	Garteon 's army is truly on board those ships .	if
4	13635	My older brother was shot .	I was a kid .	when
0	65028	That would forever destroy camilla claremont .	Bring ingrid maslen into being .	and
3	122217	He only sees me .	Something untoward should happen .	if
2	28183	Leslie opened her mouth to protest .	I shook my head .	but
0	26619	They snuck past his defenses .	Wrapped around his every cel .	and
0	124292	He had ignored simple tactics .	Revealed his suspicions to gray .	and
1	142070	And he said it .	He felt it deep in his marrow , a need to say it , as much for lauren as for himself .	because
0	90146	I suppressed my twitches as best i could .	Told myself that they thought they were helping .	and
2	45961	The first man had a not-so-handsome face that was crisscrossed with thin scars .	She hardly noticed past his laser blue eyes .	but
1	12903	I love you . '' .	You 're the only person i want to make love to without any conditions and-and i love that you need me .	because
1	142048	Just drag me off .	You feel like it .	because
2	21335	I 'd known she 'd see the transaction .	She 'd never questioned me about my outlandish splurging .	but
0	43414	As they went along , they came across seven more of the two-bier rooms .	Collected another seventy two silver pieces and six small gems .	and
2	20642	They sent a mission to the crater .	Found nothing but rumours and sand .	but
0	68883	Barrie squatted beside her .	Lifted the leg of her jeans so he could examine the wound .	and
0	7052	Rafe gazed deep into my eyes .	I saw forever waiting for me there .	and
0	71496	I was too cold too weak to obey .	I had no reason to , and in fact the little voice inside me was still urging me to run , fast , but .	and
0	76152	Caden was immediately behind her .	Gripped her in a headlock to restrain her .	and
0	34260	First off , my condolences , nate offered empathetically , the men have all heard .	They asked me to say how sad we all are for your loss .	and
3	18885	She could take it up with me , instead of using haley as a surrogate .	She had a problem with me .	if
2	109254	John died on march 21 , 1756 .	You know that how do you know that , t .	but
4	9648	And once , not that long ago she 'd gotten up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and noticed that aria 's mom was sleeping in the guest room .	Ali had slept over at aria 's .	when
2	123235	The heated interior was welcome after the freeze of the ice island 's heart .	It was still a damp warmth , bordering on the sweltering .	but
2	96274	It comes out garbled .	He seems to understand .	but
0	134102	Her parents despised the crowds and general vulgarity .	They avoided atlantic city as if they were making a political statement .	and
2	143992	Jed had warned chelsea that joshua would probably do something like that .	She still thought it was funny to see as she chuckled at the sight of him and mister .	but
4	133496	Why would anyone follow a dark entity ? '' .	They can follow the light .	when
2	99450	I know it was frightening .	Even you said you are not hurt .	but
4	58393	She and the others had shared a sliver of their lives .	Hope had been weaker than a candle 's flame .	when
1	5684	This situation will , most likely , be repeated again and .	Rational intelligent people are bound by the expectations of society and are unable to correct the fools behavior through reason and discourse .	because
0	55658	Nora was totally into scott .	Seeing the way scott responded to nora .	and
3	135549	Go pack your clothes and leave .	You dont wish to comply .	if
0	73056	The master wants information . ' .	Two of us can get it faster than one .	and
2	101819	She tried to expand the photograph , she tried to inspect the color of his eyes .	There were no more details to be discerned .	but
2	147440	Today 's airplanes were fast and safer .	Vampire transportation was faster .	but
4	132441	She moved past that kiss and on to the strained conversation that had followed .	She tired of torturing herself .	when
3	40409	The one doing the saving .	We get in trouble .	if
2	47750	Joanna and monksford were a pair of smiling fools , morgan thought .	Their happiness was near irresistible .	but
0	146192	He closed the door for a moment .	Then opened it again with his breath smelling like mint .	and
3	143644	A woman had wanted jason corwin the man , not the athlete .	It had just been .	if
0	6841	His eyes glittered in the darkness .	Swept over her figure with far more interest than was healthy for his continued well-being .	and
4	560	That appeared not long .	Another reference to nar came into contact with it .	when
2	53613	For now she was powerless to do anything .	Let him clasp her to him .	but
3	53764	He would have consummated the wedding last night - and with lady helen 's blessing .	It had not been for her rude scent intruding on them .	if
2	78283	There was someone in bills back seat .	He didnt notice as he got in his car .	but
2	35849	He kicked with his free foot to no avail .	Tried to slow the metaspide down by clawing at the ground .	but
3	59842	Edward doesnt know her or remember her .	Even it ended her curse .	if
3	76576	I wondered , but in eight more seconds i was going to find out for sure .	All this casual flirtation on aiden 's part was pissing ryan .	if
3	5057	I mean she 'd come storming out , screaming that we were ruining the grass .	We ever walked across it on our way to the school bus .	if
4	109399	How she glared at me .	I started talking about her family .	when
3	15755	To fit onto jeverres .	We made the basket .	if
0	139365	She ran her free hand through her hair .	Forced herself to laugh .	and
4	121330	Her spirit seems lifted .	She finally comes out .	when
2	89945	I had never known it until .	She told me how to defeat the immortals .	but
2	134925	I 'm heading out of town for a few days . '' .	I 'll see you .	but
2	10353	Four days skylar last seen ryder it felt like .	To spend the day with her mother and .	but
3	19788	They 'd be shipped .	Things got out of hand .	if
0	25237	He was a gentle soul .	He 'd never deserved anything that he 'd endured .	and
2	156014	`` no one wanted to hurt hanson .	They stuck a knife in his back .	but
4	50853	It was just the usual spotless like it had been slept in a day or two ago and was cleaned up after .	I was inside his house .	when
2	9391	He wanted to talk about it .	At the same time he was self-conscious .	but
3	158470	Wondering , pretty one .	Youve heard anything about a stolen bride in the quarter of stalls .	if
3	96977	Take them , too . '' .	You can persuade others to evacuate .	if
0	143679	Maybe he is dead .	This is his spirit visiting me .	and
4	123636	And some big argumentand got estranged .	Cher vil was , like , our age , they had .	when
2	20423	I 've had this bottle of wine for quite a while now . '' .	Since i never have anyone to drink it with , i 've kept it in the cupboard .	but
1	130575	I bought this satchel .	Garrett has one just like it .	because
4	72898	It was at the moment .	She felt most in control that she heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps in the hallway .	when
4	3629	It easy the girl to forget the type of man she was dealing with .	He was dealing with her .	when
2	129716	Finn was standing by the window .	I couldnt tell if he was amused or worried .	but
4	105212	Wear tuxedoes and use silverware .	They feast on our blood .	when
3	1634	Then she 'd freak if she saw it in the tabloids .	The paparazzi showed up and got a picture of us .	if
4	101909	Sometimes you manipulate your magic in a different way by mistake .	You dont have adequate control over your emotions .	when
0	47795	She finished unpacking her personal belongings .	Joined hash in the supply tent , where he was busy arranging the supplies .	and
2	32099	A man told the sheriff he saw me walk by his house with the girl on our way to the woods .	He said i lied about walking the girl home .	but
2	36525	The cattlemen 's is still standing-more or less-and so is the two sisters on the east side .	The mercantile will soon join the owl ( formerly the hobart place ) as so much ash in the wind .	but
2	92479	This was all just a sham-that woman had probably put on a fake set of iron teeth and sheer yellow stockings , and .	Called herself baba yellowlegs to make carnival patrons hand over good coin .	but
0	142360	Beth was in her room .	Placed the plastic card in the slot in the wall .	and
3	18019	The world would be a simpler and safer place . '' .	We all spoke our true thoughts .	if
0	73669	Clara took a deep breath .	Threw the cleaver at him .	and
4	90653	She 'd alienated them right before making the biggest mistake of her life by marrying skip .	She was a teenager .	when
4	96490	She would have been furious .	Nettle found her dog .	when
0	86407	So if one wanted , they could go .	Save someone before they die .	and
2	61702	Quickly drawing comparisons , udgd has realized that not only is there not a single sound in this part of the swamp .	It is also far darker , and reeks of decomposing flesh .	but
3	81073	To my replacement i am dead .	You are reading this .	if
2	89677	Aiden is irritated that sylas is with us .	There 's nothing he can do about it .	but
2	154418	We lay there , not for more sex .	To catch our breaths , and let our bodies be able to move .	but
4	50873	They will see us .	They come to the bridge .	when
0	50058	To wake up one morning .	Go for a trip to london .	and
2	10175	Called out for the young gentlemen .	There was only silence .	but
0	33460	She shook her head again . '' .	Admitted , `` it 's just the tip of the iceberg .	and
2	71667	Windows are notoriously easy to break .	I wondered how well a glass wall would hold up .	but
2	24797	Behind all was brilliant with sunshine .	Before us the face of mars gradually disappeared in the deepening gloom .	but
4	149119	He cursed under his breath .	His body reacted to the image in his mind .	when
0	44341	Jin threw his jacket on the floor , kicking off his shoes .	Fell back on his bed .	and
4	32707	He only cooperates with other lawyers .	He can be lead counsel .	when
1	88439	It involves a helicopter or a tank .	Otherwise we 're going in an unmarked grave .	because
0	84890	When sora tried to haul me to my feet , she made a critical error , because there was only one thing stronger than my tie to the pack that was the drive to be safe .	My pack-sense went into overload , but .	and
0	114700	I might as well go .	Act casual until someone kicks me out .	and
4	67975	I always say that the uncertainty and mental dimness that followed my prophetic moment were worse than the actual moment .	I tell this story to survivors .	when
0	132293	Who 's a noble liar ? '' .	Who 's the would-be savior .	and
2	5001	It did indeed fade a little then it began again more forcefully , until she thought she could hear words in her head .	She tried to make it go away , and .	but
0	11437	The text was mostly in latin .	Needed to be translated .	and
3	44738	To go to prison .	He could be the one to kill olivia when the time came .	if
4	33338	My mother was speaking with general harvey .	I led mr. monroe to her .	when
0	50510	I think you 're funny .	I think you 're smart .	and
3	152432	`` , i would have tried it before . '' .	I had known asking would make you so agreeable .	if
4	86326	There were more people than .	She stepped out of the room .	when
0	69827	He reached into the front seat .	Handed me some clean clothes - a pair of khakis several sizes too big and a t-shirt that hung almost to my knees .	and
1	154602	To meet your lackeys that have hidden inside the barrier .	Why you have empowered lucas .	because
1	72917	Adi had chosen to mark herself with it .	She was the miner who discovered it .	because
3	100501	He would be out .	She could be asked to wait for a minute .	if
3	73309	They were all at home .	The cars were any indicators .	if
2	83152	When jess opened her mouth , nothing came out .	She moved her lips as though she were singing .	but
0	136088	Each man held her by an arm .	Dragged her into the bogs of tilbury and out of sight of anyone who might be looking for survivors .	and
0	151401	We can have a quick breakfast .	Then hit the road .	and
2	45648	He would have loved to spend an hour under its hypnotic flow .	He knew better than to keep reuben waiting .	but
3	120805	It was that adam spoke plainly , yet there was a lot behind his words .	There was one thing i was learning .	if
2	37368	She swept at her burning eyes with her dirt-crusted hands .	It did her little good .	but
0	138295	It lasted over eight years .	Wells never missed a deadline .	and
4	80243	I found a disaster .	I went into the bathroom to clean up for work .	when
0	10801	The three men and the astronomer lowered their weapons .	Looked to one another for any sign of understanding for the lull .	and
0	155938	The men redressed and then the exercise was repeated .	The gun port hatches were hauled back into place .	and
0	8814	`` i was so close to living here forever , '' said ingrid with a sigh .	We made ourselves comfortable under a golden tree with rubies the size of apples hanging from its branches .	and
2	121081	Frowned at her mysterious tone .	Jo-jo smiled at me .	but
2	137895	She was babysitting a coffee mug .	The liquid inside was milky brown , with a pile of marshmallows floating on top .	but
4	69211	That 's . '' .	I saw the other couple in the room .	when
3	101650	So he could leap up .	Further developments required quick action .	if
3	51869	You can try it , and i 'll be your second chair . '' .	I win the motion .	if
0	1924	She writes in english .	She has great penmanship .	and
2	129398	I know hes not the best person in the world .	Hes been good to me and i think we can work it out .	but
0	98679	He laughed at himself .	I arched an eyebrow .	and
0	26538	The fourth could be kept worked if not bred .	- in thoroughbred as well as common lines , kennit - and .	and
2	12758	I peered cautiously over the gate .	Everything was still quiet and i climbed over and walked quickly along the track .	but
4	114942	They 're afraid of you .	Even now , now you 're almost as nutty as the rest of them .	when
4	104220	She 'd barely entered the room .	Her gaze locked with darling 's .	when
0	125618	What prissi has told him .	How she has died .	and
2	56283	It 's not a sick joke ? '' .	It 's going to sound like one , okay .	but
2	29225	She knew he 'd be furious .	She 'd risk the wrath of god to finish what she 'd started almost a decade .	but
1	26974	She would break down .	The strength of her spirit only served to highlight the weakness of mine .	because
2	18970	I had barely spoken to him .	It felt fundamentally wrong to leave him when he was hurting like that .	but
4	10907	He was very shy .	He was served by ruby as he thought she was very beautiful with her fuzzy black hair and beautiful smile .	when
0	132193	Remembering to keep her shoulders rounded and her head down , she scurried over wiped the remaining porridge off with her fingers .	Jammed the bowl and spoon into the greasy , lukewarm water in the big metal pot .	and
2	46608	Thank you for the offer .	This is a private matter .	but
3	41299	He would destroy it .	He knew it held the secrets to his defeat .	if
4	64860	That last step off the edgeand theres no going backthats .	You finally got what it takes to finish a job like this .	when
0	119807	Joe cleared his throat .	Said , we did exactly as you ordered and we had him until until what .	and
0	151881	She must have sensed the change in his mood .	Offered one more playful quip .	and
0	75743	Before the words could soak into her thoughts , he spun .	Started to leave the room .	and
2	94636	The wind was light .	It held a strong promise of frost before morning .	but
0	1488	Lightly tossing it in front of me .	Punting it a good thirty yards with my left foot .	and
2	31274	He winced at the word son .	Decided to let it slide .	but
0	64006	Choo-choo charlie was a tried and true conductor seemed ready for a new challenge .	He thought charlie would balk at the question , but .	and
0	28116	He gave a sigh .	Lifted his eyes to the sky .	and
0	15408	The light could only be susan wielding amoracchius .	Veiled behind the leanansidhe 's handiwork .	and
0	78014	Blood dripped from bercelak 's snout .	One side of ghleanna 's jaw was swollen .	and
0	63871	Woodpecker wound up his big ostrich country affairs .	Set himself on a trip to white eagle country .	and
0	16545	Mike puts the laptop in hibernate mode .	Hurries out and down the hall to david 's apartment .	and
0	68593	Jeffrey wrinkled his brow .	Lifted one of them slightly squinting as if he were trying to concentrate on something .	and
3	115376	It would be a bad thing .	The herd were to arrive tomorrow .	if
0	33473	The baby was a surprise .	Although sarafine spent hours staring at her daughter 's delicate face , the child was a mixed blessing .	and
4	135872	The small sound signified anxiety .	It was really arousal .	when
2	14121	Because i was pretty sure i was stil in love with him , and i thought he might feel something similar for me , and .	There was no way we could work together preventing the monster apocalypse/world war i i without that becoming an issue .	but
2	145580	Sitting on stools in a cramped tea tent was hardly the lap of luxury in isabella 's opinion .	Beth had grown up in poverty .	but
2	38892	Well , hes been here longer .	I only joined him a week .	but
2	147058	The door swung open .	Daisy stood her ground and listened as jericho 's deep voice rumbled out .	but
0	93457	His hands released their hold on my back , gripping each prominent bone with urgency .	Slid into position over my hips .	and
4	90247	Im already imperiled , the hunter said .	Troll spoke his concern .	when
4	114684	Summer saw walter 's car .	They pulled into the driveway .	when
4	119574	I 'll be in touch . '' .	I get my life figured out .	when
0	106334	A horrid , bumbling sound came from the demon 's throat .	He gave a sudden shudder .	and
0	61998	Chapter ten the crowd started to break .	We all walked back to edwinstowe .	and
0	22774	He simply dropped his good left hand on patrick 's shoulder .	Told him to put the door behind susannah 's little electric golf-cart , which she had taken to calling ho fat iii .	and
2	84550	Jake 's body would always turn her on .	It was this mental connection , this ability to fire up each other 's curiosity that would make him hard to leave .	but
0	43159	Sparhawk recognized the passage she was quoting .	It seemed wildly inappropriate .	and
0	50632	`` i 'm sure he 's fine , '' kylie offered .	Leaned into a dining chair .	and
0	17307	The egyptians knew it , the indians knew it , the greeks and romans knew it .	Oh yes , the babylonians knew it .	and
1	149263	Closed over the keyboard and her lips parted .	She suddenly needed more air .	because
2	126450	I had extra power .	I was unsure of where it came from or how long it would last .	but
0	160024	Pandora and marlon closed their mouths .	Simply looked at each other , no doubt carrying the conversation on inside their heads .	and
4	93700	He slithered the knife over against the side of the case and used it as a wedge to keep the bomb up off the bottom of the case .	The bomb was raised to barely half an inch .	when
0	79393	Until you came along , he had to handle all the analyses and interpretations in-house .	There were a lot of mistakes made .	and
0	120321	Before he even realized the meaning of those words , he heard a loud crack .	Suddenly the world vanished as his eyes began to burn .	and
3	6299	I promise an evening with the new miss starlit at eleven oclock until sunrise tomorrow morning in her private hotel room .	You win my silly little game .	if
3	14391	Then i can hardly wait to have you in all your glory .	That was you as only half a man , king sholto .	if
2	100354	They came to me about the horse .	I refused to render a judgment because it kept them focused on the horse .	but
0	120986	To touch that bronzed skin .	Slide her hand up the hard ridges of his stomach to caress his chest .	and
4	129182	She would know someone had siphoned some of her blood , but daisy would be long gone by .	Tina woke that night .	when
3	20151	And , she forced them out and made her mind work through the plot of her story instead of fantasizing about being with victor .	Victor 's kisses , or some of the ways he 'd touched her last night slipped into her mind .	if
0	54805	You need the blood of an undead .	We need the ring .	and
0	16256	It did not , and soon he found himself staring at the thing .	He could not go back to sleep .	and
0	27790	Roland reached up with his good left hand pulled .	Slipped his fingers between the horizontal slats of the ventilator grille closest to the hatchway through which jake had been taken .	and
2	96409	There was one last intersecting hallway that ran from the front to the back of the building .	I spotted a door on the right past the perpendicular passage with a bright , beautiful sign above it that read exit .	but
0	22997	It was the blood the ripped clothes that initially threw me off , making it difficult to identify them ; but .	Once we were within twenty feet of the gate , the images hit me like a ton of bricks .	and
0	123134	I walked out of his caravan atticus .	Alita were sitting in front of a fire with micah and a few goons .	and
2	143519	It was nothing she could have done before she left earth .	Melba koh had spent months learning about the guts of military ships .	but
0	8251	With that amulet deke , you can save rhol .	Help stop solharns depraved plan .	and
3	48026	A normal man would probably only approach .	He was drunk or on a dare .	if
2	123994	I never pegged ryder as a nice or romantic guy .	I was starting to think his usual behavior was all an act .	but
1	75535	Not feeling any of the heavy air around the room .	He was already used to it .	because
0	57499	Wlodek only suspected what some of those benefits might be .	Had never questioned merrill about any of it .	and
2	13564	You 'll wear the wakefield emeralds and the earbobs i 'll have made .	Mark me well , you are confused .	but
0	86447	Only liquid soap was used because it was sanitary , and hair , and germs .	Did not collect lint .	and
0	8328	Man and woman could be pretty horrible to each other .	In fact , were .	and
0	39408	In which ' that doom of mortality that mandos had spoken ' came upon them ( p. 240 ) , it is very notable that it is likened to .	Even it seems identified with , the fading of ' the elves of later days throughout the world ' -- as though in the original idea elvish fading was a form of mortality .	and
1	83998	But he must have anticipated the move .	He arced backward , out of harm 's way .	because
2	98362	Now kara , i dont want to hurt you .	You dont stop youre going to force me to defend myself .	but
4	52454	Bo showed off a few moves of his own , which proved that he was once again yanking our chains just to see our reactions .	We all went down to the garden that evening .	when
3	149146	What he would say .	I went back on my promise to be a good girl .	if
4	71415	The reply had been a terse , `` my grandson might need convincing . '' .	She had looked askance at the dowager .	when
2	130890	I was raised on fairy tales , with noble knights and virtuous princesses .	Nothing could be further from the truth .	but
0	157825	Tom heard a noise behind him .	He turned to see several men .	and
4	58469	It hurting like this .	She was a child .	when
0	74749	He touched his lips to hers .	When he pulled away , his eyes were still tender and amused but his words were serious .	and
2	5082	Patricia never spoke much about her patients .	She did mention you .	but
0	145880	The man leaned back , then casually returned his attention to the lab .	Looked down the hallway in the opposite direction of justin .	and
3	86605	It was going to be a long night .	This story started a hundred and fifty years .	if
3	17704	The next ten minutes would determine .	She could be herself again and finally start living .	if
2	47166	Birdy lightly hopped around on my hands .	Then a shrill , hissing voice erupted from down the hall , `` who are you talking to , girl .	but
2	37754	You calling me dam liar , son i am a lot of things .	Liar is not one of them , shouts principle burns .	but
2	13478	Every now and then , he groaned the slightest movement of his arms or shoulders brought with it a fresh onslaught of agony , and after a while , he lay .	Tried to brush away the flies that landed on the skin and began feeding off the dried blood and the crimson dribble that still seeped from his flesh .	but
0	46294	I scrunched my nose .	Waved away the smoke .	and
1	144737	`` so all you 've got is distrust of my sister .	Her last name is perkins .	because
3	55984	The jewel will glow and become warm .	They are near to you .	if
3	23663	Might miss other girls and boys .	They take time to respond to your note .	if
0	143518	As she could , i appreciate your fervor , jay , but i am quite content with my decision .	Hope you can be so yourself in days to come .	and
2	8316	I was thinking it and .	Before i knew it , i was saying it .	but
2	29339	She could not focus her attention away from gerts suffering .	Held herself away by the force of her will .	but
2	136310	Adley cradled her close while nathan turned to release the horses .	They were already gone .	but
2	142426	Implied i believe my guess correct .	She never said , nor . '' .	but
3	110555	Nothing about the altered photograph would have struck viewers as unusual .	One had been done of me and my mother .	if
2	138004	Giving them credit , they both tried to hide their relief .	I saw it all the same .	but
3	29404	Theyd only been practicing for four days .	She counted the unsupervised session at the park yesterday .	if
4	103328	I took him by surprise .	I told him that it had been my first time and it made him feel even worse .	when
0	157167	Seeing the top of bryan smith 's van appear over the horizon .	Realizing it 's not on the road , where it should be , but on the soft shoulder .	and
0	115941	She stopped short in her ravings .	Stiffened , straining her ears with painful intensity .	and
2	77032	Ben would be available and enthusiastic .	This sort of thing was far from his strengths , mostly because it required a lot of organization and sitting still for long periods of time .	but
2	131775	Soon the tower would fill him again , and thought of meat , and meat , and meat .	Now he only blessed what gods there were that his aim was still true .	but
2	69177	Her hand was not only streaked .	Dotted , splattered with blood in a horrific pattern .	but
0	94497	Hasisadra is the biblical noah .	Izdubar is the biblical nimrod .	and
0	12205	It was extremely dark .	There was no one .	and
4	109364	She drove past the commercial areas into the county on the other side .	She got to mountain view .	when
4	72611	How you described it .	You talked about drawing on power .	when
4	98040	`` , trick will tell her awful jokes .	She needs someone to make her laugh .	when
2	133788	Just then ellie walked up and tried to pull jeff off of the kid .	She jumped back and let out a cry like she was in pain .	but
3	28722	Where can such a bird reach you ? '' .	Such a request is possible .	if
4	92547	Andrews siblings quick hands were extremely helpful .	The children would cause things to float across a room filled with patients on the holidays or when we were in the courtyard .	when
3	35237	I 'd be able to see it all when i retrieved the skull .	Something happened to pearl tonight .	if
4	93772	And that horrible man smiled .	He caught her eyes again , as if he knew exactly what kind of an impact he had on her .	when
2	68121	The world exploded into sensations .	Events around me seemed to slow down because of it .	but
2	152803	Starting a new school would be bad .	Facing strangers while she was fat was even worse .	but
4	155825	Last week he was so nice , but since then hes too much , she shook her head .	We took him home .	when
4	69167	The extra thrust of the engines pushed me into the leather and i could only gaze at the blurring windscreen .	We entered country roads .	when
2	20394	The only thing coming through was the grimoire .	Now i can hear them both .	but
1	68681	That stomps on the butterfly .	Simply another child has given it his attention .	because
0	140623	Mencheres 's hair blew all around him .	My flesh crawled with a sensation of a million invisible ants .	and
4	60460	She saw his face darken .	She looked over at nathan .	when
3	147173	That were sometimes unspeakable .	Lodestok threw a violent temper .	if
2	149249	Nolen politely commanded the general to leave .	Calsifer insisted he would rather ride with them on his journey south to visit relatives .	but
1	143713	Were looking for apollonius .	I think he might know where the secrets are hidden .	because
4	97073	She appreciated the breadth of his shoulders and the strength in the muscles normally hidden beneath his suit jacket .	He pushed her onto the bed and came down over her .	when
2	63161	He was his mothers son and .	Grew alienated in a different way from the society he found himself in .	but
3	136089	I lost both sevastyan and paxan in one blood-drenched night .	Anything happened to him .	if
2	2460	She had an overwhelming urge to squeeze her thighs .	She couldnt when he had one of her legs lifted so high in the air .	but
3	146009	She was sure wouldnt work .	Her bum cheeks were poking out .	if
2	70489	Taking care of yourself .	I enjoy feeding you and checking up on you .	but
4	152057	She had spied on him .	He 'd gotten out of the shower .	when
2	13986	I thought that after we had sex my desire for him might fade a bit , become more manageable .	It 's even stronger .	but
0	15774	Then the front door opened .	His parents came out .	and
2	11358	He dropped to his knees then , frustrating me .	Only he hooked my legs over his shoulder and then buried his tongue inside me .	but
0	74001	General anderson sipped his hot tea .	Scowled at the heavily scribbled and highlighted map on his dining room table .	and
4	66660	To edge himself up the incline .	Particularly he reached the point where the walls and ceiling had narrowed so dramatically that he was fearful that he would become wedged in the constricted space .	when
1	143702	Maybe he killed gerald .	He couldnt make a deal .	because
1	8928	Teleri had known about the attack on the abbey before her husband .	The messenger of these dire tidings had awakened her with his loud shouting below her window .	because
3	129583	Druzeel would have rolled them .	His eyes had been open .	if
3	21363	Hed turn out that decent .	She ever had a child of her own .	if
0	29768	L made up my mind to appear , when i heard someone else walk onto the floor above .	Was gathering myself together to do it .	and
2	27957	The captain made bold eyes at lila .	The rest of the crew maintained their distance .	but
0	160812	He or she could retaliate .	I had no idea what form that retaliation would take .	and
0	82653	He stretched out across the tub .	Put his feet on the opposite bench .	and
4	142801	My body had burst into icy silver flames , and the silverstone knife , along with the others i 'd been carrying , had absorbed quite a bit of my magic .	I 'd been dueling the fire elemental .	when
2	107933	There was only one way to find out .	I didnt want to ask .	but
2	60062	Zayne ever lost his cool with me .	When he did , it was epic .	but
1	83615	Your hair was red .	Mom ate spicy food .	because
0	35391	The words were polite enough , but the eyes of the warrior poet gleamed bright with mockery .	Denzo ' s tone was edged with malice .	and
4	59524	Some of them freak .	They see their own tombstone .	when
2	19745	I can see how matter came about by the big bang .	For the life of me , i could not see how matter itself could generate life , or mind .	but
2	107091	He didnt want to make entry without more backup could use immediate attention .	He was concerned for any injuries inside that .	but
0	80966	But she 'd colored her hair the same blond as lizzie 's , and her lean build was the same .	Her brown eyes were narrow like lizzie 's .	and
0	152478	Then locked the car .	Set out for the park on foot .	and
2	242	His room was down the hall she assured them that he was an exceptionally quiet person .	She further explained only one other boarder was on this floor , and .	but
0	138379	He dodged her touch kept walking .	As he passed artemis , she reached for him , but .	and
3	131524	She 'll go . '' .	Maybe she wakes up tomorrow and hurts like hell .	if
0	17986	I held my breath .	Cautiously picked my way up the stairs with him guiding me .	and
0	44420	Clearly pissed off , caine shook off his pain .	Attempted to break through .	and
4	2335	I feel eyes boring into my back .	I reach the end of the hall .	when
2	122347	At the office , she tried to focus on her work .	As the day progressed , she felt even worse than she had on the weekend .	but
3	34710	It would work , jackson pointed out , and at that moment a lot more fell at their feet , some hitting them in the head .	We had more of them .	if
0	154558	The bullet missed him by an inch .	Thudded into the old mans shoulder .	and
0	84866	Then the other figure appears - and recognition .	Jealousy washes away to be replaced by awe and terror .	and
4	70511	I let out a gasp .	He leaned down and began sucking on one .	when
1	9795	In the late 1800s , sugar was extremely expensive .	It had to be brought in from so far away ( mostly minnesota .	because
0	149334	I give the troll a smile , climb onto the parapet , lean .	Let gravity take me as i fall from the wall .	and
2	19169	`` damien , '' i begin .	There 's no point in protesting .	but
3	134759	Hed get some help but in the meantime , my only hope was to try and talk my way out of the situation .	Jay were still alive .	if
2	121816	`` i absolve you of your errors in havana and elsewhere , '' he said , `` . '' .	You are not welcome .	but
2	60042	My breath was becoming more rigid .	I felt stronger than a few moments .	but
2	102181	Admittedly he was severely mentally disturbed ? '' .	Why was he able to buy a rapid firing pistol .	but
2	135355	She knew the dangers that came with her profession , and .	She chose to do it .	but
3	97133	I can institute the plans he wanted to initiate .	I take on his persona in public for a while .	if
2	97934	Well then , thou shalt make the most of thy live-stock .	Yet from holyfell shalt thou get thee gone .	but
3	26710	He will not punish you .	He does not see you look .	if
4	60350	`` okay , '' thea said .	They had unloaded the wood , leaving her backpack in the jeep .	when
1	35309	I hesitate before taking off my less conspicuous black leather sandals , hoping i 'll find them .	If i lose anything else , i swear i will never hear the end of it .	because
2	149191	Laura , we understand that you want this to be a two-month project .	We usually ask our clients to give us an extra month .	but
2	101433	Well it would be great i imagine .	It 's not going to happen .	but
4	7181	She 'd told a white lie .	Especially it had no bearing on the case .	when
0	118004	I seem to make a good guide , he smiled at usha .	Because of both pursuits , ill get a chance to visit india .	and
3	120582	She knew , the skin there would have felt as if it had been stretched over a number of small smooth stones and then sewn up again with cunning invisible thread .	She had been able to touch the biceps of her left arm with her right hand .	if
2	5320	Sarah had never seen sister joseph smile .	Now the latter was chuckling and jumping around like a child , trying to catch a glimpse of the gleaming lizards and cooing like they did to attract their attention .	but
4	33011	But , her eyes were red .	She returned from the back room .	when
1	141673	Although not unpleasant , this was .	It was a novelty to me .	because
3	46631	They would set them .	Anyone dared hint that they were anything but friends .	if
4	100975	God , it was no wonder shane was trigger-shy .	It came to women .	when
2	5950	A breath of pink still glowed in the western sky .	It would soon be gone .	but
4	27595	How the pain had intensified .	He 'd expected it to lessen .	when
2	78326	I tried to tell them you were busy . '' .	... he 's insisting he talk to you .	but
2	47356	It doesnt make much sense .	I guess everyone deals with stress in their own way .	but
3	19081	Life has a way of coming full circle . '' .	You give it enough time .	if
3	85043	Would you put her up on the stand ? '' .	You had a witness who described the same situation you did .	if
0	152438	He completed his ascension .	Then stopped several inches from her .	and
2	143914	Scott , even though i knew , i locked myself in my head and .	Went into denial and pretended .	but
0	147295	Choking up a little , he gave it a solid swing the bit crunched into the wood about a foot away from the doorknob .	The ax was fairly heavy , but .	and
0	111985	They had therefore hospitably decamped just before dawn .	Were now hiding out .	and
0	73906	Theyd been allocated different dorm rooms .	She had almost made it to bed undetected , when he finally tracked her down .	and
2	74054	The bit about the storage tanks is missing from the reportwhich i dont get .	Well leave it for nowwheres the discrepancy .	but
0	105032	They were also very strong personalities it meant they argued a lot .	They were happy together , but .	and
2	123424	Nissa and winnie were too smart to get involved in an exchange like this .	Keller could see that they were both unhappy .	but
0	102640	The wolfs ears were twitching .	Her eyes were mournful .	and
0	112971	That finally caught his attention , and looked at me in a puzzled manner and laughed to himself .	He put away his mirror .	and
4	148047	He kissed me on the forehead and told me that he still loved camilla and that he always will .	I finally finished telling him my story .	when
2	119680	Theran leaped toward them , wanting to stop them before gray got hurt .	Lucivar grabbed his arm and yanked him .	but
2	68719	This was a scratchy , feminine sound , and not anything like what he had anticipated from such an ethereal source .	Then it was not the light that had spoken .	but
4	11698	Mum looked pleased but worried to see neste .	She entered her mothers room .	when
3	97595	I wanted to be as far away from the foot as possible .	Even the only other option was to continue on our pointless trek around the island .	if
4	76495	He disappeared silently into the evergreen bushes sixty yards from the fountain and set up the rifle .	Ambler was sure that none of the civilians were watching .	when
0	43671	They were all dead .	This is good news .	and
2	139469	I 've told you .	I lied , lavinia .	but
4	46204	It seems they decided to hire a spy as another source of intel .	Viggo and mortimer discovered max 's betrayal .	when
0	100306	You are setting out .	Have even found yourself a companion worthy of equal contempt .	and
4	26909	To rely on his other employees .	He and van traveled .	when
4	131912	No one dared wake up hitler 's chief aides , much less the man himself . '' .	The allies stormed normandy .	when
4	122847	Her master works from the friars .	He 's in port .	when
0	24432	Her life had been spent almost entirely in darkness .	She had never learned to keep her emotions from showing on her face .	and
1	74676	I loved debbie with a bursting heart right .	Robert served the bar .	because
3	119192	Id be ashamed , and help cure alzheimers , but i didnt do it .	My grandkids knew i had a chance to help save the tiger .	if
0	149978	To brew more of my drink .	Give some attention to my affairs .	and
0	64014	Then her limbs slackened .	All the fight drained out of her body .	and
1	92176	`` , '' i tell him in the best femme fatale voice i can muster .	They all do , darling .	because
0	85145	He was a reaper .	I was an adept , and at the time we 'd been trying to rescue scout and escape the reaper sanctuary .	and
0	15587	Hopped into his hammock .	Started slowly swaying from side to side .	and
2	150189	Wlodek may be an ass at times . '' .	He seldom goes back on his word .	but
1	118770	The first part was proving to be a problem .	His fall had fractured a couple of his ribs .	because
2	68454	She may not be as strong as him .	She had surprise and determination on her side .	but
3	52555	For now , though i might push her .	I didnt get hold of myself .	if
4	130469	But , dr everard marquis brandon did nothing to defend my position .	My innocent part in it was exposed by some intrusive pharmacist .	when
0	2177	So that her feet dangled skirts .	Kicked below her torn .	and
4	85398	All i can think .	I enter this room is her on her knees in front of me , taking my dick deep into her warm mouth .	when
2	16555	Our eyes locked , and i regained my footing and rushed past her .	She opened her mouth to say something .	but
0	59788	I loved her , and .	Then all the other dark truths intruded , faster than i could name them or recognize them .	and
2	79126	Oh , things might get creative when it came to extracting information .	Since no permanent damage could be done to the undead , barring mental trauma , that was just the norm .	but
3	6031	One with dragons on their side was a far better chance than without .	They were going to make a stand to defend the vault .	if
4	50159	It is much better . '' .	I know i am not actually damaging anything .	when
2	84527	She opened her mouth .	Trece beat her to it .	but
0	159105	Tingling behind me i turn and .	See velshkar coming out of the forest along with his creepy human self and a few other dragons .	and
2	19846	Elizabeth pretended to wipe a tear .	Her warm smile overpowered any dramatics .	but
0	16324	Echoing in the chasm .	Seeming to accompany his words .	and
2	20805	Involuntarily , he glanced up at the bluff .	He relaxed when he did not spot the old man .	but
3	108886	Being a princess of eyllwe .	I can not help my people .	if
2	100397	These had been boys schools .	Had turned co-ed in an attempt to keep their numbers .	but
3	146204	Henry , i dont know .	Well live through that .	if
0	46122	To spend a night or two with a couple of black widow friends .	Feasted on and with the males who served that coven .	and
0	30902	Briksan deactivated his weapon .	Pushed it into his pocket .	and
4	160064	The nanny take care of him .	I was busy or at work .	when
4	8012	Even if he never got to see her , it was still better than having to face her .	He explained that the captain was dead .	when
1	113499	Apparently there is a lot of confusion .	The guide has to ask the witch doctor several questions for clarification .	because
0	99133	He had relieved gullible people of their money ; ; he had had scant regard for the law of any land he had cared to visit .	He had committed many a violent act .	and
4	72674	Now , you must trust me .	I say that my presence will not be a nuisance .	when
4	108320	The wavy glass offered a warped but breathtaking view of the sea , as well as of skylark .	I got all the way to the top .	when
2	64106	Many planets had been left untouched .	Now they were spread over a quadrant of the galaxy , leaderless , and with an extensive board of men making their choices .	but
3	7595	So intently she wondered .	He had x-ray vision .	if
3	60969	She was trying to crawl outside .	She wasnt attempting to climb out of her cot .	if
0	26271	Monika suddenly joined them .	Declared , basha , im coming with you .	and
3	110567	Go ahead and do .	You feel like dozing off .	if
0	47851	He looked at her .	Felt everything inside him clench .	and
3	73215	She 's going to have to go through the whole first circle to do it .	Jaenelle decides she 's going into little terreille .	if
0	27861	She let the confusion arise withdrew sharply , picking up control of her own body as it began to fall .	Dumped it in its entirety in the horse 's mind .	and
0	26020	Keeping enders ' warm hand in hers .	Making sure he kept up with her .	and
3	106809	We would need that calm .	We were going to maintain a long-term relationship .	if
0	16458	It might be an illusion , but then it moved again , slanting toward one of the scrolls .	Moira gasped softly from the shadows .	and
3	57491	She 'd sign on the spot .	There was a petition right now for having individual armrests in places of public accommodations .	if
0	134304	When he 'd crouched by mallory .	Gently stroked him muttering a curse in a tone that exactly matched sibyl 's mood .	and
1	88806	He packed his bags one morning and walked .	They had nothing against it .	because
0	49687	Sunshine slammed her car door closed .	Entered the rear door of the club .	and
4	49793	Thus did the vision err , for what child of light can be born .	None remain to bear him .	when
0	110756	Diane saw the approval in her son 's eyes .	Slipped an arm around jack .	and
0	152187	As kolata correctly pointed out , sir sparhawk , an eosian elene , could not be expected to understand the myriad cultures of tamuli .	Therefore would need guidance and direction in his efforts to counter the schemes of our enemies .	and
2	735	I dont have time to explain ; youll have to trust me .	We discovered a lot since lunch .	but
3	86132	Be quick about it .	You must make added preparations to accommodate our guest .	if
2	139817	Her voice remained soothing and calm .	Now held a menacing undertone .	but
0	46022	Then i shivered turned to my keyboard .	For just a second , and .	and
4	32644	Jess did come out way ahead , and the prospect of him ever leaving her no longer was an issue .	They compared cognitive abilities .	when
0	1782	I 've talked to her , yes . '' .	She asked about you .	and
0	83023	He jumped away from the window .	Darted back in the direction of this grate and freedom .	and
4	9324	Talking in hushed tones , scaring the crap out of all of us .	He flipped the flap to the entrance .	when
0	78470	He reigned over the three kingdoms of auslander , vanoss , and haroden ; a family fractured from within and not without cause for the realms concern .	While many heads had held the high kings crown over the centuries , this century belonged to the lyon dynasty .	and
1	4547	It was certainly something henrietta had never seen before in her life .	It was definitely something that should have been impossible .	because
1	27023	Now , after the marathon your legs will be exhausted but youll still be able to walk .	Some of your leg muscles will have preserved their energy .	because
2	148139	Fred opened a door to what should be a bedroom .	The space had been turned into a workshop with a table saw and lathe .	but
4	90143	Their mother and stacys dad had been too traumatized .	As children , they found out it was all a lie .	when
3	88523	Please feel free to ask . '' .	There 's anything you need , or if there 's something we can help you with .	if
0	32116	I had only been mildly disappointed when evan wasnt in my room still when i was done , but we had plans to talk .	I figured he had to get his day started .	and
0	83096	Pick up the caesar .	Move him over the balcony .	and
0	148030	She should be with him for bonding them , making her feel this way .	Finally demand the answers he 'd never given her .	and
0	78038	He then lowered his eyes .	Bowed his head signaling that he acknowledged the skanicum as superior .	and
4	66868	My dad always knew the score .	He walked into a room .	when
0	158792	Next thing you know , the police are there towing away cars for trespassing .	The guy posted out fronts long gone with the money .	and
3	3977	Sometimes a deer or somethin ' would run into gnarly ground .	It was bein ' hunted .	if
3	151356	Do you swear you will open the gate to irkalla and permit me and my friends to enter ? '' .	I give you both .	if
2	113996	They 'd escaped from prospero .	The girl had been poisoned .	but
4	46950	He 'd screamed in agony .	Pain was sent through the ring of obedience .	when
3	32536	We 'll take lane 's crew off the board .	He helps us out with one small piece of information .	if
1	71202	That made a girl feel good wearing it .	She knew a man might get hard seeing her in it .	because
2	73660	She held her spoon midway to her mouth .	Seemed to have forgotten about eating .	but
0	133776	He came back for a visit .	Put her up in that nice hotel .	and
3	4191	Tomorrow i swear to god i .	You 're not at the training arena .	if
0	80576	You are not willing that i should kill my body . ' .	You make yourself the agent of her who would kill my soul .	and
4	153231	Dawn had lightened the sky .	She arrived at a final , irrevocable decision .	when
0	125191	Hisses erupted at the first flare of light .	The vile creatures backed away from him .	and
0	137968	So , instead he dipped his finger in frosting .	Swiped it across her bottom lip .	and
4	44439	She 'd looked up at him .	He 'd touched her .	when
0	130143	He screamed as the nausea hit him .	He threw his anger against it in defiance .	and
0	34597	To lead the strike on tar valon .	The success of that attack had gained him great favor in fortuona 's eyes .	and
0	111355	He curiously stared at it , and they were leading several mules packed with supplies .	Realized it was men on horseback , a large group of them .	and
2	19702	Sarah had gotten a call this morning from dr. keating at gnn and .	She was going to appear on tv tonight .	but
0	8553	The voice was male .	Came from everywhere and .	and
3	28633	It would be better and could at least fight her off if she did lose control of herself .	The couple were untied .	if
2	129769	Music could still be heard from down the hall .	Now it featured the rise of angelic voices singing without accompaniment .	but
3	85706	I will grant you another hundred thousand dollars as severance pay .	We do break up .	if
2	13864	He looks at drummond for help .	There 's nothing he can do .	but
2	53536	She flipped on the television .	When nothing interested her , she flipped it off .	but
3	113167	It might mask symptoms .	There were something really wrong with your head .	if
2	22508	His eyes were open and .	He appeared to be whispering some word over and over .	but
3	13131	You can buy yourself some shoes .	You insist on spending some of your own money .	if
0	109924	Her long legs raised up over the gunwale .	Almost disappearing from sight quietly said well what do you want to talk about .	and
3	44844	This was like a cloud floating in an infinite sky .	I 'd thought dale 's bed was big .	if
2	13933	It could have meant several things , including that he might have illegally snuck into the dome to escape an attack .	It also meant that he could be gravely injured and in need of help , or it could mean that he had been taken hostage .	but
2	91286	The shoulder sling was never found .	The dead guy wasat the house where watson last stopped , before going to the airstrip .	but
0	101356	They have been so badly damaged .	Even a lot of white stuff pours out of them .	and
0	86581	Coal had a distinct odor . '' .	Ara had noticed that she could actually taste what keselo had called `` coal-gas .	and
0	97243	I missed had to scramble for it as it rolled under the counter .	Surprised , i tried to catch it against my shirt , but .	and
0	137458	Your presence here is a mistake .	You must go home .	and
2	137091	Jill had always been a screamer in bed .	He 'd never realized just how false it sounded until now , when he was getting a taste of her show from the cheap seats .	but
0	122571	Many know less than they pretend , but that matters little , for all hear the rumours that are rampant in this world .	Others know more than they put on .	and
3	88417	Mozart , and da vinci in one person , mr. kimball , you would end up with chloe sandusky .	You could put einstein .	if
2	156054	There was no reason to feel guilty or embarrassed or shy .	Channie couldnt help it .	but
2	104433	She had some trouble with an ex-boyfriend , ken mcwilliams , about a year .	She hadnt seen or spoken to him in about six months .	but
1	79434	That made it even worse .	It meant he brought a collinsville whore to my house .	because
0	95554	Both she and her daughter laughed .	It felt really , really good to join in and laugh with them .	and
4	134974	The sunlight hit him .	He walked out of the prison .	when
2	127702	We 've been married in our hearts for a long time . '' .	... we 're making it official this week .	but
3	147670	It 'll be pretty fine-tuned .	He 's anything like his dossier .	if
0	109000	Finally benches were dragged out of the synagogue and up the slope .	Soon some fifteen hundred or so men and women were massed in the open area .	and
1	72115	Its been my best cover in all my years of working intelligence .	Im doing it against americans , which feels like treason .	because
0	21076	No , vim replied as he shook his head .	The black braid lying over his right shoulder moved .	and
4	86261	Learned of the tragedy until the previous christmas .	He had returned home for the holidays after an extended sea voyage .	when
2	38856	She kicked her legs .	An overwhelming sluggishness hampered her strength .	but
0	1640	For the folk of arnor dwindled .	Their foes devoured them , and their lordship passed , leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills .	and
3	99230	She was going to sink into the carpet , making a wet puddle .	She got any more relaxed .	if
1	108852	It wasnt too bad at the school .	They were in different grades .	because
2	69169	He turned to look at a noise from the water 's edge .	Julio was already up and running at them .	but
2	129217	They were really ugly and all of her other clothes were too snug .	She was almost three months along .	but
3	23266	You will save yourself from a world of trouble .	You can do that .	if
3	102150	They 'd fill this room with onyx , restrain him until they did whatever they wanted to me , and then release him .	He or i put up a fight .	if
1	126687	Head lowering in shame , mairi whispered , `` i typed # estherleventis on twitter and saw a magazine article about it . '' .	She now felt she had been too petty .	because
0	121118	They could set up a nice little area for themselves upstairs . '' .	No one would know .	and
4	29321	They 'd go bang .	I pulled the trigger .	when
2	91022	One sister had eased out of the actual smuggling and selling .	Was still involved in various laundering operations .	but
0	136283	Strands of hair were in her eyes her aim was .	She tried to fight while horizontal , but .	and
4	62062	I was sandwiched between his car and my jeep .	The passenger window rolled down .	when
0	91706	Rebar and wallboard littered the carpet squares .	Cool air still flowed from the air ducts .	and
2	141896	I appreciated what buffy had been doing .	Chance always saved me , even from myself .	but
2	100848	John astor has recently married and .	He has some issues with his new bride that need attention .	but
2	46817	We have a considerable amount of hardware .	We need more volunteers to defeat the enemy .	but
0	152394	Kylie started to leave when burnett looked at the door . '' .	Said , `` come in .	and
2	78332	I sometimes sense the evil in people very quickly . '' .	It often takes something like eye contact to actually feel what they are .	but
4	82287	`` , he said that the were pursuing the two of you was a projection . '' .	I spoke with salvatore .	when
3	40917	I will give you instruction . '' .	You 'd like to come .	if
2	47875	Dylan rolled his eyes .	Trotted into my arms .	but
2	46452	Not a day passes when i do not think of him and our many adventures .	That is not evidence of love .	but
2	90251	He knew what it was .	Refused to look down .	but
4	150694	`` never vacillate . '' .	You 've already stipulated your terms and won a concession-it gives your opponent a subtle advantage in the next round .	when
2	104194	Its glass was painted white .	He could see well enough to know only a standard window lock secured it .	but
0	119223	She turned around : a pack of wild wolves .	Saw what was chasing her .	and
1	152153	Adrian must have followed her .	His face appeared again through the door .	because
3	68535	They will far outstrip us .	They have the isles .	if
1	8823	The thought of going on stage brought more dread than anticipation .	I knew that it would mean giving up more time that i could have been spending with my girl .	because
0	50772	It looked like he must have slept in it .	He hadnt changed it for days .	and
2	13899	The rain was slowing down , being in his arms next to the curb in the street , sitting in rushing storm water .	It could have been hailing for all i cared .	but
0	139967	Come to us , tiger , come to us .	We will be ready for you , ready to move on .	and
2	57386	It tried to jump .	She managed to grab both of its spindly legs .	but
2	149884	His eyes were glowing a little .	I didnt think it was enough to guide someone through a dense fog , whereas in full berserker mode he could land planes .	but
0	3594	We 're being watched - just to be on the safe side .	Every word we say is being overheard .	and
0	67457	I touched her face .	Let the tingling take over .	and
4	2562	Ay , well might you shout the word cat out loud now , safe in the ratopia of the blitz world .	Men hide in shelters and rats rule the roost .	when
2	155668	That would be wonderful to know .	Would cost you everything , that would bless you and unmake you .	but
2	10945	Smirking at her for a moment as i pull my head back i see her smile at me with gratitude , forcing her to lose her balance .	That is drowned by another yelp when i push her upper body down onto the cold , hard stone of the counter top .	but
2	18167	Someone like me could break her in half .	She had these green eyes that drew you in and deep red hair piled on top of her head that looked like it weighed more than she did .	but
4	35710	This side of her comes out .	She 's in a panic .	when
0	59504	He clearly preferred to be called about the one that had murdered their maker ( father ) lorn .	How easy it had been to bend his lesser substance with their own .	and
3	16320	We make a great team .	So you have honor .	if
3	112190	And , room for another baby is probably a smart idea .	We 're looking ahead to the long term .	if
2	39428	He was three aisles over from me .	Headed toward the center of the greenhouse where i was hiding .	but
4	137704	Adding in the meantime tie back your hair .	Ive finished ill get you a cloth to wash your face .	when
0	132604	Seven 1 surreal walked into jaenelle 's sitting room .	Came to an abrupt stop when she saw the shoes scattered around the room .	and
2	45302	Ryan gave him life .	Ryan was not charles .	but
4	9321	`` , every moan , every scream , every sensation about the way i feel inside of you , '' jett whispered .	I f**k you i want you to remember each and every kiss .	when
0	137239	She sat back on the cot , sadness marring her beautiful face .	Stared at the space in front of her .	and
2	108154	I threw the journey cd in mace was .	Put my hands to the box .	but
2	67167	And you obviously mean .	I think you 're overestimating why he brought you .	but
0	122562	Take your mangy old goat , having finished the wine .	Give it to her up the ass pierluigi .	and
2	1220	Wear longer shirts , '' i said .	My attention had fixated on noah .	but
3	40256	Miss turner , it will be your f**king last .	You ask me one more question .	if
2	103732	My life may not have been as cozy as yours .	I know she did the best she could .	but
2	53138	She opened her mouth to say yes .	Was taken aback by the twinkling amusement in angus 's eyes .	but
2	73648	He 'd thought of her so many times , imagining doing just this .	The reality was a hundred times better than the fantasy .	but
0	144886	Children tried to take them all .	In truth there were so many kinds of fruit breads and honey breads , chocolate breads and puffy breads that i was nearly sickened on them all .	and
0	89168	The arcadians had a similar mix of personalities .	Between them all , they were able to prevent awkward silences and keep to friendly cross-cultural topics as the women painstakingly brought out dish after dish .	and
0	121055	Then he put his hand over his heart .	Bowed , as if making some kind of promise to me .	and
0	34795	Linda stared grinned at the young canadian officer who stuck his head in the driver 's window .	Fascinated at the different uniforms .	and
0	103	It 's got to be a mortal . '' .	I think i know who he is .	and
0	43982	He adjusted his pack .	Set off once again along the treacherous track .	and
0	29192	Some strange man , not matt , was driving the car .	Felt worried that someone in the community might see him at the wheel .	and
0	142055	On fridays we visited the farmers ' market .	Bought produce and fresh cheese .	and
2	100390	The disrupter out in the truck could render the device safe if he got a good look .	The disrupter was a remote tool that you could only use in a non-life-threatening situation .	but
2	108640	Sure , there had been an occasional punch or a slap .	Violence was never a part of her childhood .	but
3	120381	And wondering what that would mean for me .	Tack came up with the money .	if
2	95399	I 've found out what i needed to know , and .	Said what i needed to say .	but
1	67839	I stopped making the attempts after that .	I needed my strength for a shift when i was done telling my mom about aunt anna .	because
0	86806	He lifted his head .	Looked into the mirror .	and
4	75017	But i know a great leader .	I see one-and i know that you can help me to find my young men .	when
4	134666	We had a good time .	She was able to tamp down the bitch .	when
2	80744	He wanted to walk casper down the aisle .	She told him no .	but
2	10213	Keep gathering information as it comes to you . '' .	Make investigating crowdednest your priority .	but
4	80650	How the hell was he supposed to work things out and reconnect with heather .	He was going to have to attend a string of social events .	when
2	75689	Gary suspected that the other end of the dildo was a few inches inside teras vagina .	It would forever remain a mystery because there was a bright yellow star covering this particular part of the picture .	but
2	116592	It had lasted longer than he could have hoped , and ... having what .	He was beginning to dream of having .	but
2	50507	The big russians sober mood changed , like an electric switch being turned on and off , he laughed suddenly and .	It is very good for me , no .	but
2	29676	Joyah grabbed gillas arm before they could run in separate directions .	She lost sight of mal .	but
4	112555	Who would succeed humabon , and was told the rajah had no sons , which is why his nephew had married his eldest daughter so as to become prince .	He died , for death comes to all .	when
0	52729	As they passed through the gate , he saluted them .	Said , go straight to the main doors , sirs and sister .	and
4	37717	The situation became serious .	Akbar ordered the arrest of anarkali and lodged her in a jail in lahore .	when
2	75132	Angus 's body tensed as if he 'd taken a physical blow .	He moved away , allowing zach to pull in a full breath .	but
3	151587	I could finish telling you about the party ive been invited to .	Youd slow down for two seconds .	if
2	61452	Ive only had about four hours sleep .	I couldnt feel more alert .	but
2	8897	The same was true of the enemy , and .	Another five archers came up behind dardan and started firing at the enemy scouts .	but
3	112622	On saturday , samantha called and asked .	She could crash on kayla 's sofa bed that night because she 'd be in boston to catch a concert .	if
2	19397	I know it 's extravagant ... . '' .	My mother loved her baths .	but
2	45499	She closed her eyes .	They flew open again when damien 's hand brushed her leg .	but
0	101912	Nicholas catches his gaze .	Points him out to tony .	and
0	102330	In a rage , he ran up to the helm .	Confronted his idiotic crewmate .	and
0	28751	Maybe the rats just get crowded .	Their tails get twisted up .	and
4	152120	Dancer knew she 'd guessed right .	He told her his girl had run .	when
4	1460	To see the look on his face .	... juni lays a hand on lord loss 's lumpy flesh .	when
3	3662	It would be nice to have someone to help you carry stuff .	You really wanted to go .	if
2	44418	At first goods and damage was paid for by pimple .	Soon they began lording it around and taking what they wanted .	but
4	145270	Thought of the disappointed expression on his face .	Hed broken up the fight .	when
2	116177	I was too loud and too quick and .	She shied and ran away from me .	but
2	17860	Rotten odor assail his nostrils .	That was also different .	but
4	137790	I can usually tell .	They really want to cut their hair and when they think they do but really just want it to look different .	when
0	70701	How confused he was .	She was his medicine .	and
3	134859	Laurence wondered , but then one young lieutenant pushed through towards them , flung him a look of flat contempt , and said , `` that is the traitor , is it .	He should have to find his own prison and lock himself into it .	if
0	50434	To why they didnt want an item forged knife .	He knew the perfect horse seller who worked secretly as a blacksmith .	and
0	60991	He ordered sail shortened , so the ships speed was reduced .	There were still some sailors capable of climbing aloft to carry out his orders .	and
2	83171	He smiled down at his daughter .	Niveus only continued to stare at her brother and the beautiful beast that ran in lazy loops around him .	but
2	102499	She pulled it out and i slapped it away from her .	Tried to turn it on me .	but
4	63114	I 'd worn this .	Exactly once dean and i had gone to mexico for a weekend .	when
4	120733	The laughter had died in his throat .	She began a slow striptease .	when
0	105387	The steel bubble barely deflected it .	The bullet tugged through the fabric of wax 's coat , just missing his ribs .	and
2	101005	Some in the crowd were crying , a few were clutching the wounds they 'd gotten from the bullets flying .	Most were staring at the giants .	but
0	23225	Soon the nausea dissipated .	She reached out to scratch his head , making him purr .	and
3	130148	By all means , go .	You want to say something snide .	if
4	23902	Scores was still standing outside the curtain , looking miserable .	He finally left the room .	when
2	65130	I wanted to leave him before then ? '' .	I was scared and ... '' `` and you loved him .	but
0	137429	I took the hint .	Turned in that direction .	and
1	128724	She was afraid to try to move without keeping it under her fingers .	There was no possibility of seeing a thing .	because
2	4372	At first it was a stubborn bugger .	He finally got the cloth out from under it .	but
0	98141	Instead , she looked .	Said , here comes basha , with iibala .	and
0	106975	Something in my stomach knotted into a hard ball .	My tongue suddenly felt too big for my mouth .	and
2	87052	She was open to anyone .	When it came down to it , she really wished sergio could bid on her .	but
4	37512	Rome is 25 years old .	We first meet her in the year 3455 ad .	when
3	142845	It was ali 's dna .	It really was n't ? .	if
2	45281	`` we look something alike ? '' .	What if they check and find he 's still there , working .	but
3	79603	The act would have convinced him .	He had not already had his heart broken .	if
4	145928	Because at work they almost always paid off .	She took risks or played hunches .	when
0	83074	I walked down the hal way .	Stepped into the kitchen .	and
1	80759	Vaughn arrived home later than planned .	Roy cornered him with football questions so he could help todd on his day .	because
4	138967	His eyes narrowed and he stood up in a defensive stance .	Jack turned and spotted the two of them .	when
4	125763	What will we do ? '' .	Marsh and jeffers are found gone .	when
3	38555	Shed be released , but the child would stay with him .	The child was male .	if
3	50821	She 'd end up in a padded cell .	She ever got started .	if
2	58862	By tradition , victor and most other members of the mechanical science institute remained behind to continue their research .	The other students who attended the summer session did so to make up classes they had failed throughout the year .	but
2	30000	We didnt study much of this at university .	We did do a crash study on the workings of a combustion engine for western motor vehicles .	but
0	13597	He switches off the lights .	My insides tighten at the thought of dancing in the dark with coop of all people .	and
0	101162	The knee-high grass could hide .	Right now they hid giant shields several inches thick .	and
4	18540	I yelled at her .	I saw that there were at least five pictures of luca and lyric .	when
0	109091	The future had been altered irrevocably when her entire family had perished in the fever four months earlier .	Every day , every decision , had led her here to this moment .	and
3	139561	That would have killed zach .	He wasnt his biological son .	if
0	58981	Only long enough to shove a knit hat over her curls , she clambered out her window .	Jumped the short distance to the nearby tree .	and
3	128548	He 'll say he is lifting me up to god , asking god to help me be whoever i need to be at this moment of my life .	I ask him what he is doing .	if
2	33006	She 's no masterpiece , true , and she expects absolutely nothing of me except money .	She looks just fine pressed down against the mattress with her ass in the air .	but
3	23951	`` , will you kindly tell me what the problem is ? '' .	So i stop yelling .	if
2	147365	I wished id timed it .	It was a really long time .	but
0	110041	Instead , he just shook his hand .	`` tsked '' me .	and
1	82911	Yeah , her moms probably just worried .	Were running late , i reply , feeling guilty about lying .	because
3	136308	The others should recover .	It takes the same course as it has with you and me .	if
2	96518	Grandpa told us a dozen times not to crawl through the portico .	He never told us what that meant .	but
3	15458	I 'm not sure .	He 's talking about the moon or the game .	if
0	112833	The cell was a dark and depressing place .	I had begun to think that i had reached a dead end .	and
3	21985	We might go to prison .	We dont do what the police say .	if
0	14856	On your farm , do you work the regulated number of hours per week .	Receive just compensation for it .	and
0	33350	He would spin out the pain beyond even her imagining .	Then he would kill her .	and
2	5852	What he was doing or every day that passed it seemed more and more fatalistic .	Who he was doing it with .	but
0	21164	He 's been more or less with us in spirit since all this started anyway . ' .	He is a knight , after all .	and
3	63363	`` actually , i 'd prefer it . '' .	You called me finnie .	if
2	158085	It had been him or me and .	He started off with all the advantages .	but
2	140220	She considered blockading the mirror , or at least throwing a sheet over it , and she thought better of it .	The image of the furious , unmasked erik of a few days before flashed violently before her eyes .	but
3	158034	What would you have done .	It didnt go your way .	if
4	31898	He had gone ahead of the others .	They had reached what looked like the highest point in the canyon system , challenging adam to another race which he graciously declined .	when
0	30761	To subtly pose this way .	Turn that way to show off all her ample assets .	and
2	157355	`` ... love ... you ... '' i think that 's my voice .	Is it really out loud .	but
4	109893	Pater found it difficult to believe that it was the same person that he had seen t.a .	She came on stage .	when
2	43753	That twisted the pyramid .	She paused , lifting her head to meet his gaze .	but
3	107246	To complicate matters , it would mean irrecoverable loss .	Barry stood idle while the building was destroyed since the company stock , in which the majority of barrys wealth was held , would become worthless .	if
2	85098	This is just a one layer sample .	It can be fabricated into any layer configurations to create an optimum protective exterior for the aviation and space industry .	but
2	138307	He may be emotionally reserved .	Ava was emotionally detached , which , in his estimate , was hard to overcome .	but
3	40255	Hammer head , handle , and counterweight .	The hammer didnt have dual striking heads , which this one didnt .	if
0	145088	They were walking into a trap .	There was no way for alanna to warn them about it .	and
2	17866	My father is a good man , and .	The whole town depends on him , not just me and my family .	but
4	142320	That had been revealed .	She 'd pushed the bed covers aside to get up .	when
0	53345	After a good nights rest they breakfasted the next morning .	Waited in the hotel lobby for their assignation .	and
2	88514	Her touch had been the same .	Even he could tell that she was n't . .	but
2	80602	It wasnt all badass like cuttys machete skills , until they were .	I managed to run around the small group , swinging when i saw an opportunity .	but
2	89556	She eventually ruined my brother in many different ways .	At first she made him see a different life-as if all these years there had been another duncan shriek , or the possibility of another duncan shriek , completely different from the person i knew as my brother .	but
4	130234	It was nearly dark .	They reached the van .	when
0	2599	They arrived at their rooms .	Paused in the hal way before dispersing .	and
0	54236	We pulled the car up to the door got out , gravel crunching beneath our feet .	Covered by a stone arch .	and
4	3810	He never took his hand off me .	We left his room .	when
0	58234	They ate in silence .	Then naomi went to check the dogs .	and
4	119114	She was getting close to home .	She began to see big foam dice dancing from the rear-view mirrors of other cars passing her on the road to the city .	when
2	153091	It 's actually david . '' .	I 'll sincerely drink to that .	but
2	138654	It 's a small thing , sir .	When i was on the call , cassie said she was hungry .	but
4	100862	She must have stroked , hair that she might have kept a baby curl of .	He had nightmares and called for her , touched with light fingers when he was sleeping in his bed and she did not want to wake him .	when
0	48456	Now jenn was always delightfully nasty vocal at times , but .	It sounded like she was trying a little .	and
4	85598	Do you know ? '' .	You can take a pregnancy test .	when
2	75859	`` well , you started this to control it .	Now that it 's gone , there 's no need for you to continue your career .	but
0	23413	Long some record buyers appeared .	Some even took an interest in little spirits performance .	and
2	47053	Molly was moving on , i was aware that she 'd been spending a lot more time with lloyd .	Yesterday had been the one year anniversary of the attack on the compound , and aiden 's death .	but
2	84176	Someone added the numbers , and since i knew who it was , i decided to kill him .	Came up with the wrong total .	but
3	53588	The werewolf had to have it .	A human could smell it .	if
3	52169	I am only happy to receive your help .	You are as good a fellow as she described you .	if
4	52634	Drug runners look like amateurs .	It came to `` flying below the radar .	when
2	142412	Exercise is good for the body . '' .	Music is good for the soul .	but
4	8163	It means . '' .	People take pleasure in others ' pain or humiliation .	when
0	43434	He stopped his pacing .	Added , you know , since you dont like the forest and all .	and
0	61819	This lady was certainly very beautiful , all in radiant white , she seemed almost magical to him .	Dressed as she was .	and
0	18708	After johnson takes power , this harassment will stop .	Then your associates and my associates can get back to doing business in our customary , normal fashion .	and
0	142379	Luna was pushing me in a wheelchair .	Dr. josephus was leading us through a kind of service tunnel .	and
2	43730	His plan makes sense to me .	I 've met his uncle , and i am afraid of what he will do .	but
3	142385	It looks , and above all , there 's a plan afoot which seems to encompass more than just the politics of two city-states .	Our own dear francesco de ' pazzi is involved .	if
0	49252	She looked down , his back against the wall , gazing up at her .	Saw adley sitting by the door .	and
0	60788	A small dot of white glow flared on the boundary .	Grew into a gray castle .	and
0	38040	Only a few times had bridezilla arrived after two ached from numerous yawns .	Now my eyelids were as heavy as boulders and my jaw .	and
2	84522	Marielle forced an encouraging smile at him from her flip-down seat opposite .	Then his vision was blocked by a group of three people preparing to get off at the next station .	but
2	98161	The regents voice was obviously sarcastic as he spoke .	Ben decided to play along so as not to offend him more than he had already done .	but
1	95836	I try not to mind .	I know how busy he is .	because
0	82140	No , but he was not to know that .	It were unhandsome of him to suggest it .	and
2	94657	I knew he was missing his classes .	He told me not to worry about it , so i did n't . .	but
4	18705	Miles 's face fell .	She shook her head .	when
0	99257	I have women in my pack who are as good or better warriors than any of you .	I expect them to be treated with respect at all times .	and

3	56064	`` , i keep it .	I give my word .	if
1	89273	And maybe he understood her .	The next thing she knew , she was on her back and looking up at the blue sky as his words pushed inside of her head .	because
2	69690	Maybe it was just to learn more about what he was up to .	The link between them was impossible to ignore .	but
4	84096	I fully agreed with him .	I turned with a start and saw the subject of my thoughts standing immediately in front of me .	when
4	107309	Ken and ernie lost some ground on the sprinting thief .	He made a right turn around the building at the end of the parking lot .	when
0	44004	Who had spent far more time sleeping in company than granny .	Had evolved a more accommodating nasal orchestra .	and
2	39889	His expression remained unreadable .	The dark eyes seemed to flash with ... something .	but
3	14655	We 'll supply you with a new identity and background and . '' .	You wish , a new appearance .	if
3	97991	`` and it may not matter .	We stay a little longer .	if
3	157321	We 'd probably drive your car to a place and park it to make out . '' .	We were doing the complete human experience .	if
0	147653	A small noise at the front of the church immediately drew her attention .	She lifted her head .	and
4	750	Remained a loyal tory .	The break with the colonies came .	when
1	61169	But i dont have i dont finish .	Money is something i used to have .	because
1	125378	She wanted to talk to you .	She had good news .	because
3	117949	State your purpose holbek said .	You wish to pass into the castle grounds .	if
4	73717	Whole time i 'd been anticipating a slap .	I should have been expecting a kiss .	when
3	153044	Then convincing connor that i 'm a nut job would effectively scare him .	The note is true and he 's jealous of his best friend .	if
0	18149	It had to end .	Then i 'd get my bearings and figure out where i was and how to get back to the beach house .	and
3	139755	But , if he walked through there thinking , say , about some book hed read .	Only he had his mind preoccupied with something else at the time .	if
2	87741	She heard him in the background , speaking .	She started to tune him out .	but
2	84335	There were so many things that he never wanted her to see about him .	It was already too late .	but
0	35887	Then he took the dagger , making the tip slide in between the blades and stab the wood of the tabletop .	Slid it at a steep angle .	and
0	126392	She was still dressed in her page 's garb .	On the breast over her heart was sewn lord bolton 's sigil , the flayed man of the dreadfort .	and
2	122300	I was annoyed at him .	Apparently all my lady parts were tired of being full of all that delightful flesh and not doing anything productive with it .	but
4	19225	How to know for certain .	My ... opponent has no intention .	when
2	145170	Well , it 's not the venue i 'd choose to charm you with my jazz flute .	I 'll take it .	but
3	151817	Her search returned several recent news articles .	You could call gossip websites news .	if
2	37422	I can to get back to you .	There are some things that have to be done .	but
3	132016	We could replicate the writings most important aspects .	We pick out the high points .	if

1	157989	So when they traveled in a straight line with glendower , it was . '' .	He was to be handled like the dead .	because
1	66696	To sacrifice ty 's future .	Just i have a horrible relationship with my father .	because
4	80556	I saw an arm , then a shoulder , and then the profile of a man with gerri curls , naked , except for boxer shorts and a thick gold chain .	I was about two feet from the doorway .	when
1	131135	And really , i was .	Aly was at my side .	because
2	83681	Mother walked up to him and , pleading and crying they all knew there was nothing they could do .	Wrapped her arms around his waist .	but
4	52747	I actually was sympathetic to him ; you know how i feel about guido 's wine prices .	He was arguing about the chianti .	when
2	130962	Not that long of time had passed since he 'd left flame .	It felt like a lifetime .	but
2	120124	Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day .	He was dead now and his promises had died with him .	but
2	134247	She always wanted to visit those kinds of places .	She never made the time , and always regretted it .	but
3	102849	Could i go with you .	You are going to the castle .	if
4	131969	Whose pelt is worth sixty muskrats .	They come upon the second .	when
0	79439	I lit a cigarette .	Settled back on the couch .	and
2	63190	This one was a bedroom .	Dust sheets covered the furniture .	but
2	58498	Miriam stretched on tiptoe to see .	A trick of the light or the lack of it caused the person to look like a tall , dark silhouette against the brick wall .	but
2	35557	He screened women to find a willing submissive .	In the end they were merely bodies to him ... until .	but
2	40597	He tried the door handle .	It was locked shut , of course .	but
3	78954	This was the one he 'd pick .	He could bottle a feeling .	if
3	36575	Why were you ready to commit to someone else ? '' .	You cared about my sister .	if
0	79137	There were a large number of ranks in the armies of the empire .	Many of them were untranslatable .	and
0	149083	I would take some action of the kind .	Made the ball out of concrete or similar material .	and
0	108676	Andrea passed her bag to raphael .	Came to stand by me .	and
0	72016	I shut the phone .	Jammed it into my bag .	and
2	140557	I would get what i wanted , and it would continue costing me as long as i wanted it .	It would cost me something .	but
2	61883	The blush raised again in her face and she turned away from oisins searching gaze .	She couldnt help but continue her thoughts .	but
2	157132	Eva and jackson are on another .	I see the one who i came for approaching with a lit stake .	but
2	85100	It has no meaning .	Which is pronounced commander psaiko .	but
4	106572	I nearly jump out of my skin .	I realize how close he is .	when
3	31484	First you simply put two and two together and nail him .	You find the crook with the money .	if
0	92069	Marsh nodded , but the boy continued , `` i jest been here a week , cap'n .	Was starting to turn back to the steamer .	and
0	139780	Matt die in front of her .	Watching herself get ripped .	and
2	69244	They waited expectedly for the owner of the dog to appear .	They didnt expect her to appear like that .	but
2	60143	They havent formally arrested him .	They will probably press charges sometime tomorrow .	but
0	144237	I turned back to check for brandon , but he 'd been just a minute or two too slow .	Saw him arrowing towards us through the failing light .	and
2	56638	Obviously staying in a haunted sanatorium with the bad thing was asking for trouble .	Trouble was exactly what we needed for the show .	but
2	53357	She glanced that direction .	Only heard heavy footsteps and the movement of equipment .	but
0	112137	She did save your life during the process of getting the book of antwartha .	Although it would have been preferable for the two of you to stop trying to cut the other out and work in tandem , you did indeed work together and succeeded .	and
3	32207	Then he could by god jump us out as he had the babies .	Bis could snatch us from a ley line .	if
2	133534	Angelique looked at him with horrified eyes .	You said he had been killed .	but
0	18183	Taking a deep breath , i jab the little button hold it in as a loud ring sounds inside the house .	Well , ringing the front doorbell is more likely to inspire goodwill than breaking through a window , but .	and
1	50859	We rarely saw these beings .	The human brain filtered them out in order to allow us to function normally without too many distractions .	because
0	100833	I hold onto alex .	Take a deep breath as i am engulfed by warmth .	and
3	53366	`` but , i can give you maybe two names .	You 're talking humans .	if
2	52129	She pretends to have an itch on her nose .	Really it 's to obscure her smile and it makes me smile myself .	but
0	37121	That turned my feet into roots .	Whacked my friend in the head with a spoon .	and
4	8658	It done by others .	I was sitting there watching them jealously with my steel capped boots on .	when
3	140358	She might very well shoot you .	I were to tell elizabeth that you were going to strangle her and told her that the only defence in the world she had was to shoot you right away-well .	if
0	148450	I shook my head .	Held back the tears .	and
3	152601	And , it would have been about living eternity on a whim , noton own the putting down roots but continually moving whenever he felt the need .	I 'd been turned by sebastian .	if
4	27110	Her hair tied back in a french braid .	She joined him in the lobby .	when
2	149432	Moving quickly , jo hurried out of the garage .	Instead of heading right back to nicholas 's cell , she made a quick detour into the office for a brief look out the window .	but
2	46073	I know you want to win the world championship , and i also know your love of freedom .	I have no doubt that you will .	but
0	47262	Which was scattered down on the ground .	They packed it in the bags that they had carried to the forest with them .	and
0	49821	She squeezed his shoulders ! '' .	Exclaimed , `` you 've got that right .	and
4	110042	We had agreed to do it .	I left his office in the early morning .	when
2	124133	We 've overcome a major obstacle . '' .	Now we have to refocus .	but
4	32713	She felt as if she was entering into a ship lying on the ocean floor , something desolate and ruined .	She opened the heavy wooden door and entered the church .	when
0	46384	Performed detailed background checks on all prospective tenants .	Only selected the ones that would cause me no trouble .	and
0	77334	Then he 'd spend the rest of the day .	Eve taking her as dragon .	and
0	36001	Jack pagosa , his real boss , had taken a leave of absence for heart problems or some shit like that .	Had left mia in charge of the new chicago offices .	and
2	97727	`` well , what happens if miriam says that bill and savannah are made for each other ? '' .	Savannah refuses to believe it .	but
0	44952	With that he staggered to his feet and .	Was samwise the hobbit , hamfast 's son .	and
0	27819	Adam 's headphones were looped around his neck .	He was leaned over beside blue , pointing something out on the ground below .	and
2	25357	Which worked well with grant , the oldest .	Appears to be backfiring in jason .	but
2	30293	I was irritated by her comment .	Smiled encouragingly at bethanne .	but
3	118599	He could take brett to moosehead with him in the fall .	Joe in his turn would agree to let them go to stratford on the bus .	if
4	2733	The leader was just about to touch her .	His companion pulled out the witch spray can and sprayed on befanas face .	when
3	35059	She would always reroute him back to the attorney .	He called to ask her something about it .	if
0	68021	Just mantis girl sailed down from overhead , denting it in .	Landed on the hood of the hummer .	and
0	20031	Making a federal case out of the whole matter .	Start worrying about the rice .	and
0	30223	Jumping over the rocky patches .	Heading for the sea-lion pen .	and
0	28884	The bikers were cornered in creswell .	Sought a truce to discuss terms of an alliance .	and
4	81748	I squeezed my legs from the tingle of anticipation .	His erection brushed my upper thigh .	when
3	117227	She needed a glass of wine and a long talk with an old friend first , so she 'd invited sharon over for a drink .	She was going to hire jason .	if
0	150342	I scooped some ice into a glass .	Set to work pouring a drink for another customer .	and
4	114502	One night he met his match .	He tried to oust a cotton farmer the size of a small mule , and about as tough and ornery .	when
2	17486	Substantially letting him copy her homework assignments and class notes .	Who was counting , right .	but
2	116456	I know it may sound a little dumbar .	We think its important to keep it squarely in our minds that you are our forefather .	but
3	29310	At the time and for years after , she was never certain .	He fell accidentally or jumped in order to get relief from invisible tormentors .	if
2	109268	I take a deep breath , feeling my nerves shiver inside me .	Keep my chin up as i grab my purse and head out to the living room .	but
3	114029	What would he do .	She did remember him .	if
0	14445	I waited a few beats , ready to shoot the hallway scene , totally unaware of the magnitude of what was just recorded on the evp .	Then heard the door to the hall open and dex and i walking .	and
0	145518	The scouts returned with news of the goblin army .	It seemed as though the courage of the galvahirne melted .	and
3	149275	`` , that would reassure you of my intentions ? '' .	So i were to declare fidelity to you .	if
3	102093	Itll be your own damn fault .	Something really bad happens to you .	if
0	6746	She hit the send button .	Meekly said , hello .	and
4	60029	Ethan 's voice was soft .	He wanted it to be .	when
2	71464	If this is just a dream , theres nothing to fear .	Its real , then i got a real problem .	but
2	110935	The walls were like blocks .	The floor was dirt , and there was what looked like an open passageway into another area that appeared just as dark .	but
2	123079	The men will all be down at a local bar having a few beers .	They 'll come back in time for presents .	but
2	52291	I know you arent going to reveal your source .	Can you tell me if any of our people are involved in leaking information to you .	but
1	89932	Dont you think we should go and try to prevent this .	We have a lead on the other end .	because
2	129913	She passed by the main desk , planning to head directly for the conference room .	The ringing of the telephone stopped her .	but
3	89012	Id never have met someone like tom .	I hadnt come to work at fournier construction .	if
3	5212	He 'd probably stop breathing .	He were a human .	if
0	139670	Little experience with the special powers vampires possessed .	Diana seemed faster than even the wind .	and
0	56140	The machines in here are done .	We were too late to get their data .	and
4	145956	He asked at her ear .	Her lips hit his shoulder .	when
0	93519	When even his family is threatened , he fights to control his new powers .	Becomes more powerful than his enemies can possibly imagine .	and
2	158202	I 'm not skinny .	I 'm tall and mom says i have an hourglass figure and should be proud of it .	but
0	55438	Clanging swords with his right hand he let the dagger fly .	Caught the pretty-boy to his left straight in the eye .	and
0	6518	Then he snatched up his wineglass with an unsteady hand .	Endeavored to conceal his face behind it .	and
0	119992	She would corral sanction the remaining beladors , and , train and plot the belador communal deaths .	Shiva would lock his now insane kujoo beneath mount meru-where they continue to live .	and
4	46650	She realized he held a huge leash in his right hand .	She stood up to greet him .	when
4	43621	She 'll explain what you 're doing here , then she can join your table and - `` `` what do you mean she 'll explain what we 're doing here ? '' .	Mabel goes back to collect the boy .	when
0	128769	She 'd seen it .	She was willing to face it , to give up everything for it-what arguments .	and
2	107766	He reached the turn off towards his place .	At the last moment decided to head straight towards the big house .	but
2	126796	Chicagos ohare was an option .	That is saying i know i wont make my connection .	but
0	11215	Then he turned to the west .	Hurled the stone on the highest arch he could manage .	and
4	130670	I barely got the words out of my mouth .	I kicked something that rattled .	when
0	97287	Usurping the priests role , magellan led them in the pater noster , as children of god in their innocence .	Then made a speech exhorting the sailors to treat the natives with kindness .	and
3	52321	`` , i can use that piece as a control and find anything else with the same chemical signature .	You get me an explosives sensor .	if
4	107500	Monica was sitting on the ops deck with the crew .	The massive opa ship finally got close enough for the roci 's telescopes to get a good view of her .	when
2	158946	`` let us be glad our loved ones escaped our fate , '' kolram said .	Beneath the grandmaster 's words , was pain as deep as his own .	but
4	3279	He knew my mother .	She was a girl .	when
2	104609	He was fully aware of the hiding location in the tsipri caves .	Neither the soul nor the guide gave us any of that during earlier regressions .	but
0	44111	Taylor pointed the tranquilizer gun through the bars .	Shot him in the leg .	and
0	149877	The cool breeze blew through .	Pushed my hair off of my forehead .	and
4	128184	Tears rolling down my face .	He gave me a chilling look it just made me laugh even harder .	when
2	111527	Feeling like a child , i wanted to lash out and throw the cup at his face .	He was helping - he was trying to help , at least .	but
2	105947	He picked it up with the intention of flipping it .	The construction jobs have been too busy and it 's just sitting .	but
0	96616	To teleport them to his bedroom .	Show her all of the ways he could pleasure her .	and
0	56649	Now i focused on it - pulse out of my chest and down my arm .	I felt a tingle - like the shock that comes from touching a battery to your tongue .	and
4	128360	How the vamps lose control .	A fairy is around , much less a bleeding fairy .	when
3	137814	Theres no reason to keep her alive .	Theres nothing left to take over .	if
0	75867	My damp hair was filling the car with the scent of my shampoo .	I cracked the window .	and
0	15420	Finishing work every night .	Coming back to find you right there in our bed .	and
2	75575	He still felt as if he were still being watched .	Had give up caring since no one seemed to believe him .	but
0	139178	Lahn 's eyes came back to me .	He glared at my lips .	and
2	140999	The silent forward progress was slow .	It was the only way .	but
3	99051	You have only to call . '' .	There is anything either of you need .	if
0	30145	Owen would get eva to safety , the way i always did .	I 'd take care of the bad guys .	and
3	150396	How in the world do you know all of this and were just a child when it all happened .	You werent his attorney .	if
0	111397	Amira scrambled out from under him it was clear he was already dead .	Dardan made to stab the man , but .	and
2	156538	She was younger than osgifu .	Her back sagged with exhaustion , and harsh conditions had made her skin splotched and weathered .	but
1	32310	Clearly , he 'd also put more pressure on casey 's throat .	Now casey was gurgling in an attempt to get air in .	because
3	33823	But , i could make us something to eat after .	We take this back to my place .	if
4	90183	She did not see jeff .	She stepped in the other room .	when
0	41967	When he found a vine that met the right measurements , he cut it with his sword .	Dragged it back towards the edge of the ravine .	and
4	155107	Was only fifteen miles away had they turned to the right .	The bus turned left at an intersection few aboard even glanced at the sign beside the road that indicated the town of bixby .	when
0	22967	He nodded in acceptance .	Patted om on the head .	and
4	90860	The radio was playing `` villain . '' .	I got into the saturn late that night or early that morning .	when
0	45647	She found a screwdriver in the garage .	Used it to destroy the jets in the tub .	and
4	93546	He loved the winter months .	Most of his time was spent in the woods hunting with either his father or his best friend mason .	when
2	99455	Is all very well and .	It tends to get out of hand .	but
2	157990	Who you are , neither as you are ended in this history .	It is evident that to this point you are dangerous .	but
4	35707	Andy took a measured approach to protecting his self-interests .	Even he was a teenage jock bully .	when
2	124249	He was late , he knew .	It was from san lazzaro , with public transportation .	but
3	70786	I would take it .	Even it did hurt .	if
3	25094	I 'm sure i can catch up on the regular coursework on my own .	You want to meet to pass on the project requirements .	if
3	88195	You 'd take care of our ship .	You thought you could do it .	if
2	148108	She lunged for him .	He was already down the stairs to the balcony , leaving her no choice but to sneak back into the ball .	but
0	80689	How they played chess .	Even entered a few competitions .	and
2	20308	Sure , their twenty-year-old son , xander , still lives at home .	Hes going to college and dating the leader of the schools top sorority .	but
2	149696	You make men think they 're getting one thing . '' .	It 's all a facade .	but
2	125726	It was a stone drunk surreal moment .	No one was arrested we scurried off toward campus making sure to concentrate as we walked so not to appear wasted .	but
0	107144	Eia found his hand .	Put hers on top of it it was made of ice .	and
1	36642	I have hired them to assist us .	I know they are two of the most outstanding players i have ever had in this program .	because
2	100935	I tried to form a coherent thought .	All sense seemed to have left me .	but
4	44541	Their skins were gone as black as mine .	They hauled me from the fire .	when
3	79041	And i want some of whatever you gave them .	They are still moving .	if
4	17169	I hit the button to roll the top .	I 'm a few blocks away from the john hancock building .	when
0	116622	He 'd given her .	Dropping it to the floor in a hot pink puddle .	and
0	4075	Then he turned to a small urchin who was demanding he mend a toy donkey , and .	I could not get another word of sense out of him .	and
0	95696	I 'd played it safe .	Kept my mouth shut .	and
3	120307	Do you understand what it would do to me ? '' .	Someone got to you .	if
4	94775	Twenty-seven years earlier , the curls were dark .	They were first married .	when
0	123652	Ariana and i took refuge at my uncle reldegin 's house - she is a mimbrate after all , and torasin 's very prejudiced .	Torasin made some remarks about ariana .	and
2	104503	It was a little big .	It was the thought that counted .	but
2	149559	I 'm not eating , `` .	I want you know that i really do appreciate all of this , james , everything you 're doing for me .	but
2	102460	The only way out is to have the spouse sue for divorce in order to protect his or her own assets .	Doing so , he or she will lose any say in what happens to the impaired partner .	but
1	10840	This area is the center of consciousness .	It has this property .	because
2	127757	He remembered it as though it was yesterday .	His thoughts seemed scattered as his heart began to grow heavy .	but
4	62048	Who tumbled off his rock .	He fell asleep and hit the ground with a resounding thud .	when
3	116133	Being a member of the team .	Even it was unofficial .	if
2	12334	The pain would not last long given his supernatural healing ability .	It hurt most decidedly in the interim .	but
0	127972	I 'd gotten along with the cider .	Started dabbing at the puddles of liquid on the table .	and
0	152781	Daario naharis glanced back as he left inclined his head in polite farewell .	His fellows followed him out of the tent ... but .	and
2	31441	They were tucked away for the night , and my eyes shot open , and i sat up , my heart having plummeted out of my chest .	The sun had taken their place .	but
0	145174	The pigs were heavy , but seth managed to partially conceal his body .	Did not leave much wiggle room .	and
2	23189	He thought if its producing its own heat what else is it doing .	Another image of the tattered bole slipped inside his head and .	but
1	60046	Caroline was genuinely angry .	Hunter had pushed her hand away , which really hurt her ego .	because
0	90253	Abigail waved her hands .	The door rose off the floor and bashed into the doorway .	and
1	88407	I 'd reach the point of wanting to get away from them .	I knew too much about them .	because
1	118180	She thought much worse things that were on her mind .	It was better to think about things like this than all the other .	because
0	98466	Dia left the hall .	Appeared on a path which winded away into the distance .	and
0	66370	You go through a slit .	You 're in the fireplace .	and
3	93169	The true test of our humanity is .	We can learn to forgive those who hurt us and stand up stronger .	if
2	55672	`` captain riley , '' temeraire said , `` i know you are not very fond of each other ; and she is very welcome to visit , she and maximus , if they should ever choose to . '' .	If you please , i hope you will tell lily that i send my regards .	but
4	125051	To become proud of themselves .	They tried to do good deeds .	when
0	3727	They have been flown .	Are recuperating in our medical facility .	and
2	9626	He would offer one of his cousins .	That would be a bad idea .	but
3	106054	Maybe we break up a fight at the county fair or run the hells angels out of town .	They get too rowdy .	if
2	33235	I went home and i stayed out of school for the next two days .	Everyone found out that he 'd been arrested for what he 'd done .	but
3	89620	To back off and wait for another opportunity .	Circumstances didnt add up exactly the way he wanted them to .	if
0	93762	His head-hair had flown .	His gut had grown .	and
2	85753	These alternatives take time , and .	We both know the british do not have the time .	but
2	45371	Oldest boy , raoul took off to join the service .	Always sent his money to his grandmother to help care for the other boys .	but
4	90848	Thousands were injured , just minutes before mr. c. n. annadurai was expected to address his supporters .	Police firing sparked a stampede on marina beach .	when
2	144362	Such speculations may or may not be true .	Since they influence the way we look at the prophecies , they have had their own influence on history .	but
4	47867	The girl 's apprehensions were fulfilled .	The salesman saw that a man is approaching selena .	when
0	132762	These mountains were the domain of house arryn ... and no friend to the lannisters .	The late hand 's widow was a tully , catelyn stark 's sister .	and
0	44476	His clothes were torn .	His body was emaciated .	and
1	145351	It was a little unnerving .	When he got back , he recommended that i forget the whole thing .	because
0	155286	The fin-then bounced off .	Rolled harmlessly across the sand .	and
2	52834	Thank god for all the battles won against those monsters ? '' .	There are more to win , arent there lads .	but
0	18434	I then dangled myself over the prow .	Let my body fall into the water like a jackknife .	and
0	11339	To have to first get through the ranks of guards .	Then enter the garage , where nico would no longer be able to help him .	and
3	156895	It would have been better for francesca 's health .	She 'd accepted gerard .	if
3	94711	Then shes probably eliminated them until they no longer appear to exist .	Thoughts of you bring emotion to her .	if
3	126097	There should be a village of fair size an hour or two further along .	That is mount sardlen .	if
0	158896	I heaved the suitcase up to dump it .	Staggered backward , off balance , in shock .	and
3	92802	Why 'd you shoot up my apartment , buddy .	That was the case .	if
2	15413	Every instinct screamed at him to head to aberystwyth , to ensure the safety of his wife and daughter .	He shook the thought .	but
2	67119	Not to remember out past in the ocean .	The memories were never far from me .	but
0	144340	He shoved their wait staff uniforms into the packages .	Sent them out the window , back across the balcony of the neighboring building .	and
4	68082	So kaille said , throwing out an example that made roses heart skip a frightened beat , its in some ways an easier way of saying that having women around makes things more complicated .	We say , for instance , that having a woman aboard brings a curse upon the ship .	when
1	49499	God he wanted to help her .	She needed him as sebastian .	because
3	116644	It would never surprise me .	One day , someone got their own back .	if
4	59253	It would have ended between us .	You went back to omort .	when
2	89299	I tried to get beth to wait at the brothel while i took care of it .	She insisted on coming with me .	but
0	88614	I turned on my heel .	Headed back toward the shed .	and
0	14432	She was escaping that psycho .	Made sure you did not get raised by that horrible man .	and
2	15315	I didnt really consider myself fbi , having only gone on one kind of case , and was good at puzzles .	I had worked for the government for a while .	but
2	54619	I can only see part of his face .	The anticipation now growing inside me says he must mean something to me .	but
2	83413	The man is a great magician .	It 's not he 's a rock star or anything .	but
0	44478	Demon guardians can be so influential on the flux .	Someone can be controlled by his own guardian to the extent of losing total control over his body .	and
0	49335	She got up , nudged her awake asked her to watch the children .	Crawled to her sister .	and
4	100119	He was standing on the other side .	I opened the door to go out .	when
0	47908	To rip every one of their faces .	Shove them up their arses .	and
3	19656	Then i thank you for removing the burden of guilt from us .	There is nothing more that we can do , and know that it is hard for us to accept thisif there is nothing we frail mortal beings can do to stop an immortal emperor .	if
2	114938	I could take matthiass jabs or digs .	I could not allow kane to become somehow protective of me .	but
4	121808	Hed been the pharmacist on duty at some point .	Back duty mattered and pulled a weekly paycheck .	when
2	104678	Hayden was an asshole . '' .	At least as long as you were involved with him , i had a reason to keep my distance .	but
0	160325	It was a cloudy night .	Once they were out in the open the breeze was noticeably brisk .	and
4	17624	She 'd felt that night .	She 'd learned that he 'd been forced to become a vampire had evaporated when he 'd taken her blood .	when
4	44657	He unwraps my bandage and his brow creases .	He sees the cut .	when
2	23183	They claimed to have failed to get the gemheart .	It was open knowledge they 'd won and hidden the winnings .	but
4	122731	I need to grab your hand and well see what happens .	So i feel like im going to pass out .	when
0	67591	You can see me then give me strength .	I am now , and , and whether i can see you and give you strength .	and
3	34711	She just spelled it all out .	I was ever in any doubt about how well kate knows me .	if
3	123591	... '' it was better for her to see him exactly as he was .	He 'd come after you , if he 'd tried to hurt you .	if
3	87340	For a moment , i wonder , but i see the crushed cigarette still on the ground .	I imagined the entire exchange .	if
0	98737	Jack and gideon lit two more torches .	Tossed them into the hay piled near a store .	and
0	22833	They were red swollen and .	Matted with dried blood .	and
0	58709	To talk to al .	Find out if the demons know what happened .	and
4	124499	He first met jamie montes .	He was in the army during operations in south and central america .	when
0	58661	`` whatever you want ... just make them stop ... `` a pennywhistle piping began .	Echoed down the passage .	and
0	109176	When we got out , he led the way away from the gate toward the house next door .	He directed me to park the mustang behind his place , but .	and
1	115752	Mary ended up at your parents ' place .	She wanted a normal family .	because
2	76512	I would love to introduce myself .	Now all you need to know is that i am a friend .	but
2	2830	There were plenty of valet people .	They paid me no attention .	but
2	109911	She wanted to prostrate herself on the grass and bury herself in tears .	Her pride would not let her .	but
3	135985	It would be a shame . '' .	Your company found itself in financial straits by a number of your more expensive properties becoming damaged .	if
1	69733	March flashes me a smile .	He 's in my head .	because
1	37758	Him not wanting to go into it .	He 's decided to ignore his visions .	because
2	142888	A long moment passed .	She heard no footsteps inside .	but
3	138283	It is because , looking back on it , it seems there is no very dramatic reason .	I hesitated to answer .	if
0	86458	I followed my usual routines .	The hours slipped by until it was finally time for me to close down the restaurant for the night .	and
2	88356	Dax was careful not to look at the creature .	He 'd already seen the beady eyes glowing bright through the foliage and the stare was directed solely at riley .	but
0	19957	Interfering in your worlds destiny .	Obviously , i was not particularly adept at it .	and
2	30272	He even stepped inside the station .	Found the inside empty .	but
0	90627	To press against her inner barriers .	Force her to feel a little of the pain he was enduring .	and
4	123962	I 'll give you a call . '' .	I get a chance .	when
3	98491	It will mean death for all of them before it can be completed . '' .	They build a force field .	if
3	68713	Would it distract you .	I raised another issue .	if
2	154654	She had washed the worst of the dirt off last night .	Her sojourn in the cave had left her with a layer of grime that the towel had been powerless to remove , and a faint , pervasive smell of damp and decay and seaweed clung about her hair .	but
2	110577	The pain seems to have eased .	She has such great courage its hard to tell how bad she really is .	but
4	123970	Horsa was not a man of formality , however he demanded it from them .	It came to the way he treated his inferior officers .	when
0	11969	For a while both watched the sparks fly from the fire .	Wink out in the darkness .	and
0	88893	That she 'd survived .	Diana had n't . .	and
4	56207	`` well , i was surprised .	I found blake having sex with another woman , '' i snapped .	when
4	20075	`` well it 's kinda weird .	Someone asks me what his name is .	when
4	150405	The words dean said to me .	He gawked gave me head rushes as i replayed them in my mind .	when
4	150071	She recognized the challenge .	His eyes met hers .	when
0	43937	Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed pretty low in the water .	He guessed that these had dwarves inside .	and
0	150196	Reason to suspect fablehaven had been discovered by the society .	I was supposed to locate the artifact .	and
0	156897	To place himself aboard this speedboat .	Help pull ariel out of the water .	and
3	117158	Of course he is only a probationer in both cases .	You see what i mean .	if
1	134410	To stop staring at her mouth .	Apparently i was incapable of talking and staring at the same time .	because
4	59707	She was a marshmallow .	Their lovemaking was finished .	when
4	16784	Jason and fi were married and .	They werent hiking , spent their days working for a busy firm of solicitors .	when
4	99825	Eduard packed up and .	She was strong enough to come home .	when
0	30751	You bring me a purse containing 500 gold coins news of what has happened to the double-crossing burgermeister , and .	I will release the children .	and
2	53380	There might be others .	This one was lost and it was painfully embarrassing .	but
2	8643	I wanted to go to the cliff in the hopes that he might come out or even to leave him a message in the cave in case he ever went .	Nikolas said it was too dangerous and everyone else agreed with him .	but
4	121251	Washing down the doorjamb .	Kaiden sniffed the air .	when
4	127028	Ready to retrace my steps back toward the lounge .	Cliff said , `` wrong way .	when
3	78385	All those nights , sitting together , talking , pouring out our lives to each other , i 'd have known .	He was capable of cold-blooded murder .	if
4	89324	Halfway to the second station .	More debris started falling through the water .	when
4	99013	I tightened my hand on hers .	She tried to pull .	when
4	38524	He continued to glare at dillon while cam dressed him down .	She returned her focus to dalton .	when
0	9244	Find yourselves a seat .	Tell me what happened .	and
0	1005	Tretchbolt hit thomas on the forehead .	Pushed the hilt into his hand .	and
2	93389	I am no longer a terrified little boy or a fearful youth , he was drunk , and .	I easily bested him .	but
4	25337	I guess because i 'd envisioned something like this happening .	It did it was almost deja vu .	when
1	149084	`` , '' he admitted , his eyes growing serious .	The part called for it .	because
2	81570	It was more expensive .	Money was no object when it came to them wanting a baby .	but
0	66580	What i did say .	Left the dining room .	and
0	17111	Holding the emf reader .	Stretching as if he 'd been in the car for hours instead of thirty minutes .	and
1	97036	The guys are on my case .	I set a minimum payment .	because
1	34969	They arrived at the airport .	Early the waiting was getting on cedrics nerves .	because
0	148891	Finally , mercy flooding back into me , i stepped forward ; they scurried across the floor and rolled up into a ball .	Plucked the glasses off from her face .	and
2	143887	Constance , my pa , is sitting with them .	She 's data scanning something , based on the rapid movements of her eyes .	but
2	115350	Vaughn would enjoy going another round with carrie 's brothers .	Unfortunately he had a long drive back to grand forks .	but
3	155631	I doubted , but he thought enough of his buddy to name the family diner in the hinterlands of colorado after him .	Stannos had read it .	if
2	108158	I hadnt really thought about them in days and days and days .	I turned my head toward the steel door of the lock-up .	but
3	151188	What would they have done .	The dwarf had shaken his head .	if
1	48865	I chose this bev galeskas pattern , no matter what level they are .	I feel everyone can knit this .	because
0	103921	He half-closed his eyes as if in relief .	As his eyelashes lowered , she saw how angular his cheekbones looked .	and
0	407	`` can you do me a favor ? '' .	Not tempt fate with statements like that .	and
0	92064	The titans had taken over the heavens .	Ordered aeron to kill danika and her family .	and
0	91366	The child 's name was khelan .	That jarred my sense of the way things ought to be just a bit .	and
0	94524	He lifted up the pix of the girl .	Tried to remember the portrait in the airie he had studied a thousand times .	and
0	104114	Fang took the bowl from her .	Sipped it like a cup .	and
2	41805	Come , fair ones , and .	Listen to me tell a tale about the history of the most perfect paradise that ever existed .	but
2	19601	I cant remember the exact time .	Aaron soon caught back up to me .	but
0	33065	It reaches between two points of communication .	Brings people across from one point to the other .	and
2	12248	We havent discovered pattern recognition anywhere in the inanimate world .	It exists everywhere we look in the living world .	but
2	13205	In his deepest heart , virgil long suspected that something was off , that there was more to his daughter .	He ignored that niggling feeling .	but
0	59558	Victoria had traveled since dawn , so she was tired .	Had slept little for the last ten days while they journeyed .	and
4	106531	She cried out his name , the sound a broken sob .	He worked a third finger inside her .	when
4	1193	You got ta start diggin ' '' `` mr. moody .	You want to get to the bottom of anything .	when
2	113858	I did survive and .	Im now ready for the next step in my self-rehabilitation which is getting him out of the house .	but
4	90389	He moved inside and slashed her arm to the bone , severing tendons and rendering her left hand useless .	She moved her blade to parry the blow .	when
4	146150	Lily came bustling out .	She saw who her guest was .	when
0	73447	The other man went on , `` .	They took out our peacemaker .	and
2	33348	I waved my hands .	This time , i didnt bother with flames .	but
2	129052	I tried to smile .	The pain seared through my body .	but
2	10229	They 've changed his face somehow . ' .	I know it 's him .	but
0	139238	A buzzard hovered at our height to the left of the house , determined not to seem too intrigued by my next question .	I admired its brown plumage .	and
2	38529	`` i 'm going to kill your friend , '' he says , `` .	First i need to locate him .	but
2	14435	Smithie is a good guy . '' .	There are limits to the times cops can come and shut him down because of me .	but
0	153274	Klavin pushed his glasses up on his nose as if that would make manfred look better .	Stuart 's lips pursed like he 'd just bitten a lemon .	and
0	111010	Robert knows his way around the woods .	We have shared various tips on wilderness survival .	and
0	15434	He deposited her at her house .	Went to orchestrate the rest of his plans .	and
3	151634	There is no way , absolutely no way that you would be held accountable .	You shoot this man .	if
2	128342	Their brother might not have been a threat to anyone .	He f**ked up , forced your hand , put himself and ricky behind bars .	but
4	112401	I 'm relieved letting me in .	The door finally buzzes .	when
4	148121	The only time i really get to see gale now is on sundays .	We meet up in the woods to hunt .	when
0	14759	The large man introduced himself .	Then turned back towards logan .	and
0	51115	He sat down in the empty seat across from me .	Set the carafe on the table between us .	and
4	64105	He caught her wrist and grinned .	She pulled the length of linen from around his neck .	when
0	133786	He 'd predicted me .	Laid down his fragility in my lap , an exquisite trap .	and
0	38001	Within one hour , the shades were shut , lights were .	The men simultaneously closed their eyes , going into some disturbing group naptime .	and
4	100437	The spring temperature dipped .	The clouds obscured the sun .	when
0	45828	The red swellings on her neck had increased in size .	Were now dark oozing sores .	and
4	105885	The first waves of people were transported against their will .	Deucado was still a prison planet .	when
4	90364	He was a senior .	I was a freshman .	when
0	109852	He was stronger faster than any living man , and .	Had been so reaching adulthood .	and
2	107050	Chloe 's facial expression never changed .	Her body shed just enough tension that i considered the possibility that the stick typically wedged in her butt might have been dislodged .	but
0	42537	The thought of sitting in what was basically a new jersey replica of eatonsburgs eats was more than she could tolerate .	Ethan eased the car onto the highway and started towards the city .	and
0	24726	She walked toward the line .	Spoke to the cook .	and
3	51582	I would apply tar to your wound . '' .	You 'd dress up in a sheepskin for me .	if
0	153670	Who 'd come up to our table .	Asked cole or maxwell for their autographs .	and
3	101939	She would be gone , so i kept them closed and focused on her presence .	I opened my eyes .	if
4	18524	We made our way to the elevator .	The bellhop got the okay to lead anna to our rooms .	when
2	128519	The pay is low .	Overtime makes up for the difference .	but
0	58030	Tomika put the box on the counter .	Went to the sink to pick up one of the dishes by it .	and
2	1858	She briefly considered dragging her pillow and blanket up the stairs to her room .	By the time she finally rolled off the coach to make good on the plan , the sun was .	but
0	88336	I loved that place as if it was a part of me .	Perhaps , in some ways , it was .	and
0	30255	He repeated the process with another two pairs of wedges .	Then tested the rudder for movement .	and
0	83463	I held her , warm and slender .	Felt the terrible remorse and frustration and grief that coursed through her .	and
2	80757	I 've heard of that , '' mike said , `` .	It seems pretty far-fetched to me .	but
2	26642	He felt like he would burst he shoved a knuckle into his mouth and waited .	There was a very long pause , and .	but
2	87472	Susie had graduated by .	Everyone was shocked at how he 'd turned out .	but
4	11596	True , he said .	He came back armed with another order .	when
0	60059	Geda and habala cleaned up the common room .	Then went to bed .	and
2	142136	He 'd been trying to tune him out .	Jake was a relentless bastard .	but
0	11524	So i forced myself to open my eyes get up on my trembling , wobbling legs .	Push the rocky rubble off my body .	and
2	69072	I 'm suddenly revived .	The games are over .	but
2	91842	Losing him would be so painful .	Having him walk away and return everything she 'd given him would be unbearable .	but
0	38117	Heidelstrauss hung up from talking to major lindisl .	Looked at the clock .	and
2	25178	I spun around and she swung back in time .	Almost caught joss in the face with my flailing arm .	but
3	70940	He had a handful of ass .	She arched into his touch .	if
0	57788	She could hear the dull murmurings of the soldiers as they moved away from her father .	Before long , she could hear them no more .	and
3	5274	If all that we have shared is not enough to bring you briefly home , then at least offer your prayers for our people .	Your answer is negative , and you are unable to leave your evangelical duties to attend to a friend in distress .	if
0	77231	I 'm rich , talented . '' .	I make girls cry .	and
4	71381	I knew she had gone to the next world .	The last speck of light disappeared .	when
3	7577	I would die , reese . '' .	I lost you as a friend .	if
3	40106	In there im going to personally drive him back to mashhad and hand him over to the prison authorities .	Hes spent all afternoon .	if
0	46255	They are enemies of our meg .	They are enemies of the sanguinati .	and
2	134306	`` if you simply succumbed into the obvious lust between us , i would have a pleasant night .	Then there would be nothing to look forward to .	but
0	5046	Sparhawk broke the seal .	Opened ehlana 's letter .	and
0	35835	Get down to the brewhouse , but he better send his lads to fetch them or i 'll find someone wants 'em worse . '' .	Tell tuffleberry that i have two dozen barrels for him .	and
4	91856	His concerned features softened .	He took my hand .	when
0	87883	She dropped onto the chair .	Looked at her foot .	and
0	27789	Grow up smart . '' .	One day you may work for me .	and
2	6179	Her heart was pounding .	She kept her breathing tightly controlled .	but
3	153620	`` and , you or one of the others would come and let me in ? '' .	I were to go out and came back later and rapped on the knocker .	if
2	116689	I hesitate to provide tea without biscuits . ' .	We have not eaten for two days .	but
0	160149	His feet moved silently against the forest floor as he stepped toward her .	She felt his hands brush her arms , a tingling shock running over her skin at the connection .	and
0	60966	Running round town grabbing sandwiches on the run .	Climbing the stupid hill to the hostel .	and
2	127759	Whenever i showed up at his establishment i usually cut into his profit .	He was always friendly to me .	but
2	140944	Peter cared about her .	He never understood the pain she was going through .	but
2	148930	He was pretty sure she hated him and didnt see him as any better than other vampires most days .	The woman had a way of shocking him .	but
4	20923	What she thought she was doing buying a gun to carry in her reticule .	He saw the nash 's buggy parked out front .	when
1	13366	I know you do .	You go running every time he 's about to sing .	because
3	113508	They might become the family she 'd never had .	Her grandparents were compassionate and trustworthy .	if
3	88828	I would have to say he feels like the big brother i never had .	He wasnt so playful and young acting .	if
3	22191	When she needed his cooperation , but both pride and habit made her lash back at him .	She wanted to have a prayer of keeping the ranch going .	if
0	25833	I will fly with you . '' .	Viktor will follow with texas .	and
2	86992	Wondered if i looked as dazed as he did .	Then he was kissing me again and we were stumbling against the shelves .	but
4	87226	How she could see him .	The world around her had become niagara falls .	when
2	108300	Musically , i 've come to like everything , even hip-hop and pop .	My southern roots come through in my love for country music .	but
2	71294	His build was on the slight side .	His forearms looked like steel snakes coiling beneath the skin .	but
0	32358	Dont suppose well ever know .	So saying , he placed the medallion about his neck and rubbed it .	and
3	150045	Theres not really anything we can do .	A vacuum cleaner has reached the levitation stage .	if
0	73341	Mantas laughter was quick to draw the ire of the young prince , but asked , what makes you think it wasnt someone outside the castle walls that sent these men upon you .	Only after it settled down of its natural accord did he turn to simeon .	and
2	89627	Allan is a very capable man and a skilled warrior .	Will he be enough to protect them .	but
0	81295	The curved gallery opened into the upstairs bed-and bathrooms .	Already she knew exactly where patsy was .	and
4	143213	He 'd had to learn this stuff , along with alejo , benjamin , stalin , and a bunch of other guys .	Hezbollah trained him in iran .	when
0	84167	Then he looked further in the clearing he saw the grass move in some weird fashion .	He did not see anything but .	and
0	101141	He shoved his hair from his eyes .	Tried to blink the sleep from them .	and
4	90866	I can sometimes fill in the rest .	He tells me about something .	when
0	146147	With his bad hand tracking along the wall and his good one leading with his sword , he went around one , two , three full turns .	Burst out into a square chamber .	and
4	49198	He couldnt lie in response to a direct question .	Especially everyone else seemed to know .	when
0	65821	Most of the town was in it .	To agnes 's surprise they 'd brought along many of the children .	and
4	112863	I chose . '' .	To shift and when to come .	when
4	92440	To slam the door .	He noticed something in the back .	when
0	99747	My cousin elizabeth prayed in a low voice .	One of the men said for the children to get back from the door .	and
4	46585	My wife could hardly keep the steel out of her glare .	She looked my way .	when
0	67683	The feud between the mars and the sheeriles had started eighty years .	Was still going strong .	and
2	98255	There had been markings on it .	Generations of plump fairy godmotherly hands had worn them almost smooth .	but
3	110437	`` not , '' sheerin said .	You listen to some of the other people in her department .	if
2	14281	The small lobby was comfortably crowded .	Spotting the ride coach wymack promised him was easier than neil expected .	but
0	157817	Already opening the driver 's door .	Bailing before he could stop her .	and
2	689	He may not be able to control forever with rena .	He could make sure he heard that echoing completion .	but
2	93773	For now she let their bodies do the talking and .	Knew the words would come when they were needed .	but
2	137261	Children 's screams continued to burst out , sharp and sibilant .	They were now punctuated by the deeper shouts from scoutmasters and chaperoning parents .	but
4	122765	I had not expected to need it .	I had given charlotte the rose pendant the night after she was released from the dungeon .	when
0	103886	A gust of wind ruffled her hair , scattering white on her dark hair and cape .	Sent down a shower of snow from the branches above .	and
4	55665	It was hard to focus on his righteous words .	Every thought i had conjured was hell-bent on seeking revenge .	when
2	17988	Heck , i was still gon na hope they kept the fangs holstered .	That was more a backup plan .	but
4	128027	Reach for me , i will answer .	It becomes too difficult .	when
2	107551	She stood up again and no other animals came into view .	Scanned the barren rock all around her .	but
3	61646	About you today , your grace , '' the old knight said , as hizdahr went to greet his cousin .	You had unsullied guards .	if
2	60396	I knew that eventually i would have to go downstairs to collect the homework the prince had delivered .	I felt no sense of urgency .	but
0	25951	The price of slaves is rising , they said . '' .	There are thousands more women and children at hardhome .	and
3	52973	Of course , the challenge , especially with the horla is to figure out .	He is in fact insane or acting well and proper .	if
2	30833	Gotten to the mental part .	That may be my favorite part .	but
0	135480	I showed my face .	Forced my mouth to make words .	and
0	89307	I wrap my hands around his waist .	Pull myself against him .	and
0	6466	When back at the dorm , i grabbed my purse and my food .	I went to my room .	and
2	81601	She reached over and the large round metal alarm clock clattered to the ground .	Tried to hit the snooze button .	but
3	138983	I 'd ally myself with the morindim .	I thought it 'd do any good .	if
4	79456	Then closed my eyes back , swaying slightly although i was seated .	It was over i opened .	when
4	132085	I had leaned back against the seat , and now i was frozen in place .	I saw the figure .	when
2	81834	At first it was only gray .	Then the color returned , too , as his field of vision expanded .	but
0	108910	I was tired , as if id come out of a seizure .	I thought maybe thats what it was .	and
3	74671	Which are called um and thumwere not sure .	There are just these two or more , but just these as our familys heritage .	if
0	45192	She 's dropping everything .	Will be here in ten minutes .	and
4	44771	I was sitting against a tree .	I felt someone kick my boot .	when
4	118987	Devlin sat in a daze and only remembered meeting aldritch and some barbaric morpher on a random lawn .	She and the tall dryad exited .	when
0	11533	His lips had thinned .	The muscles in his jaw had tightened .	and
2	25345	Those relationships never lasted more than a few weeks , and .	I 'd told myself that all the while , he and i were growing closer and that he 'd eventually fall for me .	but
2	144063	The strange sensation was over in an instant ; was it a dream .	The next thing dan could see , as he squinted to focus his vision , was the sight of a strange man leaning over him , gently tapping his cheeks with the back of his hand , to revive him from his slumber .	but
2	69838	They planned to reopen it .	The plan never came through .	but
4	86171	I 'll come and find ye . '' .	I 've finished doing all of alec 's work for him .	when
2	67242	I was the reporter of choice for central and south america .	I didnt grumble much -- it was still quite an adventurous experience for a young lad who had never stepped a foot outside his own small town before .	but
4	112669	The only time i can get anywhere near you is . '' .	I 'm f**king you .	when
0	160616	He left darcy 's room .	Sought out his curs to make sure they were prepared for the inevitable arrival of the vampires .	and
0	61236	He breathed on me .	I backed off a little .	and
2	131162	He looked at me .	He was right , it did come out sounding all wrong .	but
0	113512	But those outcasts were taken to britain in the large boats .	Left there to die .	and
4	131633	They had glanced up briefly but they were in the middle of a conversation and kept talking .	The car had slowed .	when
0	64964	`` isaac , you will go .	Instruct your pack to remain inside .	and
2	30649	My fists flailed at his face , his neck , the air .	The blows had no effect .	but
3	3659	Guy would turn on his own mother .	He could get money for it .	if
0	119658	But she sat beside him .	She kept touching him .	and
0	100841	Me feel good , within myself .	I almost wanted to cry .	and
2	130753	They hated these reminders .	Amelie accepted it all with good graces , at most giving a little whimper when they put the needles in .	but
3	159437	Im keeping it for myself .	There is any gold .	if
0	40588	I shouted ; the cab sped past as others now called out to us .	He jumped back as if given an order .	and
2	109421	It can grow to 25 meters in height , with a stem diameter of up to 16 cm , [ 1 .	Is more typically 15-20 m tall and 12 cm in diameter .	but
2	102079	There was a part of melody that wanted to share with someone exactly what logan meant to her .	Now was not the time and victoria was certainly not the person .	but
4	145468	Use me as a space commander .	They got themselves to vulcan .	when
2	21190	She tried to slow it down with another breath she was too upset .	She could feel her heart racing and .	but
0	14622	The earl tossed his blankets .	Climbed out of bed .	and
0	9932	`` it 's not too soon when it feels so right , '' he said .	Paused , studying me for a moment .	and
2	117145	The pilots of the space tug that rescued rei were ordered by the overmind to overtake the ark for observation .	Were not ordered to retrieve it .	but
3	116088	A distinct line of coldness traveled across his skin from front to .	The wall of gray were a standing plane of icy water .	if
4	83081	Thus you assured me that our destination was aurora before i actually asked .	I was wondering if i were really landing on aurora .	when
0	96326	His forearms were crossed in front of his chest .	He was staring at the ground at his feet .	and
3	37670	I have a special finger gesture just for you .	You dont like it .	if
4	145092	Julie felt herself exhale , thankful that it had gone a lot better than she 'd thought it would .	He finally got in the car .	when
0	121952	She turned into the parking lot .	Pulled up alongside the curb .	and
3	112713	We came up with a story that justified his firing his weapon .	I told him more it would get worse .	if
0	53872	Brian buried his head in his hands .	Brought them slowly down across his face .	and
2	95536	Ridge had hoped they would stop sometime after sunset .	The two outlaws had no way of knowing that a posse would not be close behind them , and so they kept riding on into the night by the light of the clear bright moon which soon rose in the sky .	but
0	131871	The heat blazing inside .	It only took a few seconds before i felt suffocated by it .	and
0	126189	The tool is capable of making a hole in the leather .	The hole is made .	and
2	15261	I know it sounds strange .	They are all connected mentally what do you mean .	but
2	85908	Used to beg tricia to sign me up .	She said she refused to spend money on camp when she was free during the day , so summers meant me counting the hours until the garcias got home .	but
1	65299	I lurched in like a zombie dragging my useless foot behind me .	Lifting it and then having to set it back down was roughly the equivalent of walking over burning coals .	because
0	95439	Despite his best effort , kira saw a trace of hunger even in his expression .	She wondered just how much control tristan had lost , not only over his friends but also over himself .	and
0	133870	Fully plugged into the system .	Integrated in such a way as to be no longer aware of the real world .	and
3	61174	There is no other . '' .	I can not fix it .	if
2	99760	I felt anchored to her grave .	With each step i took , the weight became a little easier to bear .	but
2	157537	That should be bathing the room with daylight .	Was instead blocked by the remote-controlled window shades .	but
2	10635	Laurence might almost have called it an absurdity , to have four immense dragons watching himself and granby with so much cold anxiety , and with not half so much attention on iskierka and temeraire .	The tense suggestion of waiting violence leached any quality of humor from the circumstances .	but
4	76384	This time , jac couldnt tell whether she was teasing or .	Jean-marie forced a smile .	when
2	83678	Jessie helped me clean up .	He continued to avoid speaking to me .	but
4	28789	Only minutes from death , the monster had slipped its noose , oiling out in black tendrils .	She 'd passed out for that final time .	when
2	73980	It felt odd at first .	Somehow also right his hand made contact with the cold surface .	but
0	127760	Nicole laughed waved good-bye .	Kissed iona 's cheek .	and
0	117701	Instead the area was opulent , radiant .	Well shiny , is a good way to describe it .	and
4	101561	It was your free will that let it go. .	I took your towel .	when
4	76136	He would forget the initial impulse .	Then reality settled in .	when
2	58257	He snapped at her again , saliva flinging across her face .	She just stared into his fiery eyes .	but
0	55154	I pushed off with my boot , landing on my belly .	Leaped onto a lead horse .	and
0	38752	Lucan grabbed her face .	Stared deep into her eyes .	and
0	23897	To prove what you 're made of .	To help save both our lives .	and
2	118060	His face is serious .	I can tell he 's making a very dry joke .	but
0	78417	My oaths require me to insist that you surrender yourselves to me at .	Accompany me back to callaston .	and
2	69618	I try reaching amanda to find out what else she told him and reginald .	Neither of them respond to my communications .	but
3	119452	More lanterns would be lit .	The heavy rain persisted .	if
0	113521	He quickly knelt before the old man who promptly knighted the boy then sent him on his way after telling him exactly what must be said and done .	The boy 's eyes widened in wonder but .	and
0	119158	Verity gripped the flashlight .	Wondered frantically what jonas was planning .	and
4	32905	I would never do .	I saw her again , because i knew how it would make her internally squirm in discomfort : i began to cry .	when
0	153677	Brendan handed david the sandwich .	David smiled at him in a perfect mime of typical american eager politeness .	and
1	54623	An invisible punch smashed into his solar plexus as the answer snaked through him .	You thought you were surviving the worst .	because
4	25335	His eyes were flat and lifeless .	He looked back at me .	when
3	89599	You can win thenext battle. .	You cut enough losses .	if
0	103511	My gaze drifted down to his hands .	I looked for a very faint , very small scar .	and
2	85914	He 'd lost another of his guard here at sweet gorge , but located by a search patrol just a half hour .	Killed sometime this past week .	but
2	103624	I 've even tried to have him killed on the streets .	The man is the crescent 's sweetheart .	but
2	40649	Not that i 'm complaining exactly ? '' .	Why do you keep threatening to kill him .	but
2	3612	He 'd never really intended to be good at marketing .	When his ex-wife had started sleeping around on him .	but
2	103696	Edging clear of the fighting , i would have slipped .	A crowd of vampires was blocking my path .	but
3	19854	To carry them out on our end .	We want to contribute to the success of the war effort .	if
4	100341	And how proud gio sr. must be .	He looked down on his sons .	when
0	88394	They bumped into each other .	Tripped onto the court .	and
0	146510	Not sure what to say , he looked back at the dolphin .	Pointed to the shiny area underneath .	and
2	1498	I completely enter the vision above me , blazing through its darkness with my hands turned on .	The glow is swallowed by the shadows .	but
4	2236	Then stood there expectantly , she forced her thoughts back to the matter at hand and shook her head .	He handed her the shirt .	when
3	41854	It might be for the best .	You continue to live with your mother .	if
2	30878	No one really did . '' .	That was the idea .	but
2	52356	I was tired enough i could close my eyes and go to sleep .	I 'd just gotten home .	but
4	5601	Trystan could barely get the key in the lock .	They got to tucker 's door .	when
4	83850	It collapsed a few feet from the open window and safety .	The beast released the body .	when
0	138223	Their stingers were poisoned wherever they hit flesh instead of steel , our folk got hurt .	We did well enough , but .	and
4	6194	She enchanted him with her beauty .	They were young children .	when
2	9535	Her body showed signs of long-term drug use .	It was impossible to tell whether drugs had directly contributed to her demise .	but
0	3131	Both lea and tania entered the arena .	Started heading to the ring .	and
0	93185	His son was before him .	He did not know him .	and
0	72782	It was then i realised something .	I sensed that sam was realising it at the same time .	and
0	20842	Talen had wedged the ends of slender tree-limbs between the floorboards of the cart .	Then had woven them into a shallow basket that fit snugly under the bottom of the stolen conveyance .	and
1	61179	The instinct is strong with you .	You were born to the blood .	because
3	83529	Shall we see ? '' .	It actually reveals a clue .	if
4	128487	He 'd dropped the gun , had nothing but his bare , freezing hands .	He 'd fallen up the slope .	when
0	44587	In only maybe half the cases had he known their names .	From that august group , he could recall maybe one out of ten .	and
2	118051	`` i understand . '' .	I 'm only following orders .	but
0	44278	More batteries fired from the telenian .	Impacted on the lead cruiser .	and
2	127743	I can tend to you , and your leg is gone .	Make sure you live .	but
0	134964	It was just gone the flood roared through the village .	Turned to soup by the rain .	and
2	74355	She might call daddy and , after the fact face-to-face confrontation like this , no holds barred .	Get his lawyers to chase like yippy dogs after the police force .	but
2	44795	He knew it wasnt healthy what he was doing .	He didnt like losing control .	but
0	37082	He stopped trying to hide his grin .	Dazzled her with a display of pearly whites .	and
2	158058	Garreth was a hell of a fighter .	On occasion , he needed a wingman .	but
0	143256	He begged her to release him , but she remembered his refusal of her as vividly as on the day that it happened , so she denied him .	Our vicious queen has no mercy and no forgiveness .	and
3	17571	He 'd removed his tie .	He 'd ever had it on to begin with .	if
2	60427	Acts like that can not help .	Generate good will from the gods .	but
2	108468	It would be a close thing .	There was nothing she could do about it .	but
2	99840	Cronus might have commanded the lords to find and capture the other hosts of pandora 's evil .	The titan king had never stopped searching himself .	but
2	130865	It was too soft and shaky to come across .	The speaker was trying .	but
2	146163	I stood up to help .	Clara was holding my arm , not allowing me to step .	but
2	46776	In this moment , absolutely nothing is happening .	Then again everything is happening .	but
2	65903	It had taken more than a decade .	El-hamin had wrested control from his uncle , then several more years to get rid of the remaining men loyal to him .	but
4	120551	Ana shouted at her , make sure youre ready on time .	She was about seven feet .	when
0	112227	The gatehouse was alight with an orange glow .	The guardsmen on watch stood outside in wet cloaks , halberds held to the side .	and
2	113034	The gods had not willed it , and .	He saw nothing in these women except greed for his wealth and power .	but
2	98178	We are strong , each in our purpose , and .	We are all more strong .	but
0	157731	It was still cold , damp sooty , but .	The room was quiet , and the space was mine .	and
3	78008	To be excited or worried .	Dizzy feelings failed to show up .	if
0	23358	Sarssen rose in a leisurely way put out a hand .	Crossed to the bed .	and
4	94816	Took it out on rouge at school .	Were we hanging out in the courtyard a while .	when
4	1741	Why he only saw light .	Alex had looked in the future mirror .	when
0	92159	It was an unexpected apparition .	Van cheele found himself engaged in the novel process of thinking before he spoke .	and
3	153930	There are some things you had better fear .	You have half a brain in your head .	if
1	145302	She said and then had to run out of the house .	He got the nobody home scary eyeballs .	because
1	105329	You and i are going to be doing business together for a long time , costa baby .	If you say no , i go right to the police and the newspapers and spill the whole story .	because
0	53745	Beside justin , mae jerked .	He held her hand , pulling her back .	and
0	141619	Still , the little witch beneath him gripped lucan .	Trembled , even as her face turned red and her eyes began to roll back in her head .	and
2	34364	This may not be mainstream .	May have utility in some meaningful way .	but
3	92242	They can have their own trial . '' .	Someone else has a problem .	if
2	28440	I opened my mouth .	Left the greeting unsaid when i saw his head was bowed .	but
2	119977	The blue boy repeated his liscence .	Sven did not change his confused expression .	but
0	68847	It wasnt the first .	Came easily because of it .	and
3	39143	A wizard can change his hat .	The leopard can change his shorts .	if
3	9894	What shall i do with her ? '' .	I 'm sent back to endovier .	if
4	145364	It was the way it would be .	He expected something to be done .	when
3	80911	`` , '' bob said , `` it might not work .	Even you do everything .	if
2	83691	They roamed his eyes caught mine and his were now serious .	He shoved his up the back of the tee and .	but
2	112838	I tried not to move .	Parts of me were moving that were even more involuntary than the rest of me .	but
0	128958	Somehow , he could turn .	Return to school right this moment .	and
0	98410	A thin trickle of a stream flowed over rocky ground .	On the bank above grew a tree barren of greenery .	and
0	138503	In the dim flashing light , bits of webbing hung low .	Trembled off its neck and body .	and
3	87440	`` i asked her . '' .	There was a place in town where i could take you and not be , um , conspicuous .	if
2	6995	His cock was still deep inside of me , throbbing enormously from blatant arousal .	He remained still , unmoving as he penetrated deeply into my eyes .	but
2	131622	Liao wanted to stay there until it finally woke up .	The duties of a ships captain were too much for her to ignore , especially without an xo to take care of the details .	but
0	29824	Bearl and geron stepped out on the wharf .	Walked to the road that led to the settlement , visible from the shore .	and
2	26836	Another minute went by and i assured myself everything was fine because no blood-curdling screams or gunshots had gone off in the room down the hall .	I was still anxious as all hell .	but
4	9787	He began to work her g-spot harder .	He thrust his tongue against her clit .	when
2	10521	I 'm not angry .	I 'm in the mood to be terrifying , so i take great care in the morning after the races .	but
0	30788	They had stayed too long on this small hill .	Time was now too precious to waste .	and
2	48504	My shirt had fared a little better , because it was stretchy .	It had still split up the seams .	but
0	112541	He started a small fire .	Waited impatiently for the rabbit to roast , salivating at the smell .	and
0	95909	Boston rang the doorbell to shelby 's grandmother 's house , not sure if shelby would actually come out with him or .	Shuffled his feet a little on the porch .	and
4	30629	She turned from her place by the hearth , and her shapely brows went .	He flung open the door .	when
0	113130	All that qualifies me is my ambient talent , but there just arent enough of us .	Theyll only let adepts operate in the field .	and
0	97075	I swallowed a spoonful of the warm beans , trying to isolate the many flavors .	Focused on the sauce that coated them .	and
4	15542	And , to dance my signature role of clara in the nutcracker , you didnt even bother to attend the performance .	I returned here last christmas .	when
2	15339	Shed looked right through him , at the wall , at charlies alien sorting methods for tea and sugar .	She hadnt seen him .	but
4	158981	Let her through immediately . '' .	She wants to see me .	when
0	34520	During the process of domestication the more intelligent animals have performed an artificial selection with these varieties making sure that they multiplied .	Choosing the ones that they saw best fit for their purposes .	and
3	102251	He 'd bring it up .	Zane wanted to talk about it .	if
1	128506	To ask the `` handcuff to the bed again '' question .	Heavy 's stare sliced to me and it was my turn to get the father bear treatment .	because
0	6370	Farmer whispered to biggs .	Asked the next round of questions .	and
4	121220	He had known ahead of time .	The fen patch would cease being helpful and set everything out .	when
2	19320	I know my dad told me that my mum had removed all photographs of her good self and taken them with her when she had left .	She might have missed at least one in her haste to exit this life .	but
0	80861	Then the ancient demons grow a pair .	We all shove you in a little hole in st. louis .	and
2	90057	No one would ever accuse me of being a funny guy .	I suddenly wish i were .	but
2	4702	He felt the air caress him as it blew past .	He knew the speed and force he had put behind it would be more than enough to put the smaller of the two attackers out of commission .	but
0	135496	I was miles from home .	There was no way i 'd walk in the dark .	and
0	97062	My flight was leaving the following afternoon .	We planned to head out to the airport .	and
0	32323	In the land of the dead , the men and women of the weeping forest could not focus , so they perished one by one , like fawn .	Could not think through a plan of attack .	and
2	15123	When he turns to take it in , i 'm tempted to pull him back and use the few extra minutes we have to get reacquainted with his lips .	I know he 's curious .	but
4	51313	Is captivated by hunger pangs and his sweet tooth .	He recalls what he is here for .	when
4	90334	They end up asleep in bed .	She 's feeding the baby in the middle of the night .	when
0	89069	I want you , '' alec said .	Magnus closed his eyes , as if the words almost hurt .	and
4	75514	She only picked up messages .	She climbed up the tor .	when
0	87755	As long as we 're clear , '' lucian said .	Then glanced to anders as he arrived at the cottage door behind them .	and
4	113511	There were many sunday mornings .	Devoted sctvers would drag themselves to church or simply call in sick and sleep until noon .	when
3	31014	In there unnoticed , the most lethal thing he would find was apt to be a crumpled-up dentyne wrapper .	Even he could sneak his hand .	if
4	26972	He took me by the hand , led me into his bedroom , and quietly closed the door .	I entered the room .	when
0	127152	She swung over a wooden gate , straight in with water splashing everywhere but it cooled her .	Plunged down to the stream .	and
0	160032	`` there will be , '' said the man in black .	He took the teas and went back to the table , where his two comrades waited .	and
0	63752	Some native pollen had seeped into her nostrils .	Twisted her sight into some miasma of ebon and violet .	and
3	86544	None of this would be necessary . '' .	You hired writers who could spell the word journalism , or even knew its basic precepts .	if
2	2290	Devyn started to check on him .	Nero held his hand up for him not to approach .	but
2	75527	Theo needed more courage than he currently possessed to phone her , and .	More courage meant alcohol .	but
3	84136	How bad can he be .	You like him , he reasons .	if
1	53108	Had they fallen off .	The operation had gone wrong .	because
4	67317	Fenrics tasks took on an ominous light .	Seen through the sparkle of a piercing blade .	when
1	107845	I 'm only going .	I 'm the emergency contact person .	because
3	93613	The box to be tossed in a ditch .	The final act had followed his carefully considered instructions .	if
0	103846	He had misjudged it .	The slick rocks would dash his head open .	and
4	145030	Perhaps , they would be the type who kept america safe .	The looming next world war eventually arrived .	when
2	139934	When it 's about mila we work on instinct . '' .	When it 's about us we work on emotion .	but
0	156109	You must control your fear .	Not let them see youre frightened .	and
2	76482	In this moment , i hated not seeing his face .	I knew he understood the point i was making when he took a deep breath and asked , `` why the f**k did you stop ? '' .	but
0	4179	I shall take you back home . '' .	Then you will drink .	and
2	9211	This was not the first transport which laurence and temeraire had traveled on .	She would be the first true oceangoing one ; a poky three-dragon ship running from gibraltar to plymouth with barely a few planks in increased width could offer no comparison .	but
0	5475	`` i can go invisible and , watching over them . '' .	Follow them to school .	and
2	19732	I wanted to say yes , all the other boys , they moved .	She shook her head .	but
0	158641	Every word shed spoken , each smile shed worn , each cold shoulder shed given .	Each warm remark shed made .	and
4	155934	She had met him at a party or in a professional setting .	He wore a suit and she wore something other than his t-shirt and a pair of underwear she 'd washed in the shower .	when
0	151518	She had observed her father and his interactions with various political rivals .	Had learned enough of such maneuverings that she thought she could take on the local fishmonger , at least assuming she was in the mood for fish .	and
0	71924	First a team of specialists flew in from states side , both physically and mentally , and also to prepare me for what was to come when i finally arrived .	Then over the next few days they gradually altered my medication so that i would be more able to withstand the transfer .	and
2	84209	I have ever known , alex .	I would never think you an imbecile .	but
2	121959	Part of me was trying to enjoy the trip .	Another part kept wondering what would happen when i got to the top .	but
0	74951	Even if you did intervene , her fate would have simply been rewritten .	The hands of your watch should be counting down for her .	and
2	126430	I thought sen was the only one capable of this much . '' .	I have a new appreciation for centaurs .	but
2	131650	It was as though they were waiting for me to explain .	I opened my mouth to do so they all erupted into monstrous laughter .	but
0	60463	It was no wonder nehemia .	Her family kept such power a secret .	and
2	13862	She wore her tight black curls short against her shapely skull .	The effect was more sophisticated than gamine when paired with her striking features and pretty , feminine curves .	but
4	151721	He made sure to be out hunting in the hills , though by then he was so monstrous fat that running was impossible and there was no chariot that could hold him .	Menestheus went to visit him , and later agapenor .	when
0	132738	With a final check , she climbed from the car .	Keys in hand , dashed up the stairs .	and
4	34868	He ran his finger across his throat as if slicing it open - perhaps hed been speaking to mrs thomas .	I looked over at him .	when
2	59436	Vaughn paled , his tan skin taking on a sickly , sallow tint .	He slowly squared his shoulders and gave her a respectful nod .	but
0	76429	Then with a last , longing look at the doorway , he rejoined his friend .	They completed their sweep of the area .	and
4	27923	I pull back and watch his eyes .	I feel his smile fade .	when
3	91696	My king forgive me .	This is out of term but perhaps it is best if i speak to him .	if
1	118972	That was practically non-existent .	I was certainly no culinary genius .	because
0	92389	You could cut a hole in the ice .	We could drop down through .	and
0	125112	When he looked up .	Saw the evening star glowing calmly against the dark blue velvet of the sky .	and
0	120167	Who has ever downloaded an astrology program .	Then checked for errors .	and
0	91778	I have done nothing to her ; nothing at all . '' .	I do not mean to .	and
0	153896	But the city still loomed ahead , growing larger and larger with each step they took .	It was growing harder to understand if leaving the forest would be any help at all .	and
3	46222	She would wager this massive tunnel once housed an equally massive vehicle or vehicles .	She had to guess .	if
0	28760	I nestled into king 's bed .	Covered myself with the soft silky red blanket .	and
1	71011	I paid nearly two quid for this suit .	I thought he was taking me out .	because
4	58986	He was inclined to agree with bryce .	It came to william 's character .	when
2	5470	It 's hard to think about fashion when i know my squad is fighting without me .	I can serve best .	but
0	126650	They still have their nice safe little home world out .	They sure hell wont take this defeat lying down .	and
0	39096	My hair was tangled .	Matted to my forehead .	and
0	21653	Setting the cane across his lap .	Kicking his boots up on the dash .	and
2	157356	It was a long , weary , and doleful journey , especially after he had gone beyond the habitations of men .	The minor canon kept on bravely , and never faltered .	but
1	29821	`` i must have twenty cars .	Just i 'm rich .	because
2	63066	She saw that most of the men were sitting outside eating their lunch .	A few of them were heading to their trucks to leave .	but
0	107689	After that , they refused to stop .	Made another simultaneous exchange with right hooks .	and
4	19246	It seemed ages ago .	I laid in that hospital bed .	when
4	48263	`` hi , nikki , '' she said .	She reached my station .	when
0	110531	The blue bard played for us .	Ser tallad showed us how to fight with a staff the way the smallfolk do .	and
1	60337	Leaving the girls in beldin 's custody may have been a mistake .	Polgara at least had been a very apt pupil .	because
0	103642	Now they 're deaf blind .	Let 's make them poor .	and
2	139656	Most were typewritten , if not there were a couple copied in long hand on hundreds and hundreds of legal pad sheets , neatly stapled .	Composed on a word processor and printed in dot matrix or laser jet .	but
2	39713	The cooling blast of autumn air filled his lungs .	Did nothing to return him to his senses .	but
2	130967	It 's barely bigger than a closet . '' .	That 's the way all the offices are in this place .	but
1	33067	I lost my husband .	He was afraid of what his doctor might tell him when he got sick .	because
0	147007	Must follow both paths .	May not stray from either .	and
2	123306	He was only a month younger than jason .	Was a year behind him in school .	but
0	74850	She was not sure what she would have done if hed have been holding her when shed woken .	Wanted more than anything for the feelings from that dream to be real .	and
3	76891	You 'd want to be somewhere you could see it all .	Someone landed a submarine on it .	if
2	148596	`` the afp contracted us on a bullshit assignment that 's got me twisted in knots .	It 's not just that , i ... it 's this job .	but
2	134300	They rushed up after him onto the deck .	Already the gangplanks had been tossed into the ocean .	but
4	134386	Her aunt blush and fuss .	Savannah had turned the policeman on her .	when
2	92915	Yes , he 'd punched through the wall last night .	This tree was a solid oak .	but
4	27934	My own family had abandoned me .	I was a child .	when
3	21386	How to convincingly play the role of his wife .	Especially the cops get suspicious and start really grilling me .	if
0	156430	I 'd been forced to choose a side .	I 'd chosen humanity , life-and lucas .	and
2	55173	I try to fight the soldiers .	Their combined strength disables me to be free .	but
2	83474	I think she wants to stop .	She 's not sure how to do it .	but
2	154960	He steeled himself and .	Touched the dead man 's face .	but
0	148066	Muffy , lulabelle , and susie had each had at least three litters of their own .	Not one of them had a puppy left to show for it .	and
2	107198	Xaviero had dismissed tatijana and branislava so easily , using them for his audience just as xavier had done .	He had never credited them with brains or the ability to learn from him and his brothers .	but
0	125995	Throwing his head from side to side .	Squealing each time the collar bites into his neck .	and
3	30034	I know i can .	You can find happiness .	if
1	708	* * * marlon was grateful for the sounds of the river and the ghouls .	His own team sounded as if they were clearing brush to make a bonfire .	because
2	44196	In 1692 , nineteen witches were hung on gallows hill .	There were other fatalities as well , including their friend giles corey , a respected farmer in his eighties who was tortured to death , suffocated under the weight of heavy stones because he refused to enter a plea at his trial after he was falsely accused of wizardry .	but
0	123619	Seths right hand whipped across the air .	Everything on the table disappeared .	and
0	134144	I had left donita .	Went down on my own to see what the deal was .	and
2	135121	I almost wiped my hands on my spiffy-keen , orange jumpsuit .	Stopped at the last moment .	but
0	22652	In a tiny tantrum , debbie slapped at a nearby mushroom .	Sent the cap crashing into one of the dead trees her mom called a colonnade .	and
2	152368	Elizabeth looked concerned as he winced .	Ronan shook his head at her .	but
3	3120	He was certainly in the mood to let her .	She wanted to be in control .	if
1	144882	In reality she 'd ended up straddling both her parents ' visions of the world .	Mainly her mom was an expert when it came to the manipulative power of motherhood .	because
0	4910	His face was pale solemn ... and .	Then he grinned like a lad. .	and
2	29570	The gates were wide open .	There was nobody around , which was hardly surprising at six fifteen in the morning .	but
2	105229	I thought she 'd put up a fight .	She did n't . .	but
0	79281	I strode past him .	Grabbed his collar as i did .	and
4	97945	You will probably lose consciousness straight away and if you 're lucky you will not awaken to see what comes out of you .	I inject this into your neck .	when
0	4612	Then he lowered his head .	Stared down at his drink .	and
2	715	Not staying , plans on only a moment of silence then he was out the door .	The hard pull of obligation pulls him in .	but
4	18810	That i thought it would be better to shut off the other senses and experience nothing but the feel of it .	Max was being gentle .	when
4	14610	We took any shelter we could find while still fighting off the zombies .	We were satisfied we were far enough from bellgard .	when
3	155036	`` why would we be standing .	We were truly thieves .	if
3	72638	Despite her wounds , she 'd go out and prowl the city .	She were left on her own .	if
0	71752	Remove him from the legion . '' .	You remove his ability to disrupt events in any meaningful way .	and
3	47797	Me to figure out .	He was angry or if it was something .	if
2	80156	Its eyes are sewn shut .	The threads that had sealed its mouth are cut and they dangle from its lips .	but
2	30957	Jeannie , i wanted to check on you and tell you that were doing everything we can to find your daughter , he began .	I dont have any news .	but
0	47935	He gave a nod .	Laid the complicated patterns .	and
2	65668	I 'm ready . '' .	I still need a little time .	but
4	87445	From now , would change their lives .	A quiet confession spoke in bed .	when
0	149945	Lee hurried to his side .	Shot us an apologetic look .	and
0	19078	I heard a light sound .	Turned to see sam slipping through the window .	and
0	1532	Giggling , i gunned my minivan .	Headed off to colton .	and
2	137772	The schools will teach a kid how to use the crossbow and the longbow , and a maybe little hand-to-hand combat . ' .	They do a very poor job teaching kids new skills and how to apply the old skills the kids have already learned .	but
0	157878	They put the hides in this slurry to soak overnight , then used it to whittle half a dozen bone needles .	While susannah began to make thread from strings of gristle and sinew , roland re-sharpened his knife .	and
2	7863	There i could survive .	From the world of death , there was no return .	but
0	134406	The farms were mostly empty with their demise , the population had dwindled .	The water disappeared but .	and
4	6636	I was only halfway through the list .	The phone rang , and i grabbed the extension sitting next to the pad .	when
1	106838	I was probably crazy for saying those words out .	They could only get me into more trouble .	because
3	19024	Then she 'd gotten ripped off .	Yannah was her guardian angel .	if
0	36437	To stand over corpses . '' .	Say , `` this is what we fought for .	and
0	49871	She inclined her head courteously ; the attending dragons shifted their places to make room for laurence and temeraire on her right , and the human servants brought laurence a comfortable chair .	Flicked a talon against a standing bell nearby to summon servants .	and
3	85670	That was the main thing .	An airtight guard could be put around lincoln and grant before naylor struck .	if
2	119968	He expected chad to joke with him .	He remained dead silent .	but
0	33932	`` you do realize that i will have to kill you now , '' lilif hissed .	Ari flipped over to find the wench striding casually toward her .	and
4	86362	The fellows on the team snickered and laughed at the awkwardness of the new player .	He tried to get his hands and feet in position .	when
2	105598	I 'm sure she thinks i have all the power , that she 's at my mercy .	That 's only i fight day in and day out to maintain some semblance of control around .	but
4	47874	She met hannah in the hall .	Rose opened the bathroom door .	when
0	116741	It 's yours , '' she said .	Her eyes were now so intense that her gaze felt hot on his skin .	and
0	115784	She was masked , of course .	Wore a long gray coat .	and
0	8820	The children crawled over the edge of the loft .	William pulled the ladder .	and
0	134434	Eat boast and bellow at arstan .	He does nothing but .	and
4	8121	She sputtered a great deal about a book .	I spoke to her .	when
3	53319	Yet his mistreatment made her wonder .	He felt the hurt and underlying pain of knowing he 'd taken advantage of her .	if
3	45597	Not doing my job .	I dont express my legal opinion .	if
0	109355	In the moonlight i saw the gleam of metal .	I saw that jake was pulling a long knife from a sheath on his hip .	and
2	37409	I 'd intended to present orion with a series of songs , an entire opera .	I only had pieces of each song done here and .	but
0	1804	The bandits seized the opportunity .	Pinned the guardsmen down in the centre of their group .	and
4	155541	He wanted me at the apartment .	He got home from the desert .	when
2	45266	I fancied i was in love with jack .	He only wanted you , so i was jealous .	but
3	33855	They can go off .	They 're tossed around .	if
2	41960	The termites repair the damage .	The mound is always built up more on one side and washed away on the other .	but
4	134312	She noticed his leering look .	The caravan master had arrived .	when
2	4030	She opened her mouth to reply .	Before she could , isaac got thrown violently to the side .	but
0	28949	His gaze lingered on the blue stripe in my hair ? '' .	He asked , `` what 's the story with the blue .	and
2	47063	He had time for an early dinner , yes .	Then he , d have to be on the road for home .	but
0	45209	Gaent took over the relaying of information .	It was assumed that he had found and spoken to delralous .	and
2	24109	The most honorable firepelt has been brought to life , kesol announced to no one in particular .	Nerasa nodded in understanding .	but
4	73962	Sharing the responsibility of a child is automatic .	His parents are married .	when
4	56815	Bruce sighed , and added heavily , i wish there wasnt still more , peter , but there is .	Peter folded his arms and looked .	when
2	5607	They 'd essentially starve themselves .	At that point they 're very close to the end .	but
3	72225	But you must stay ahead of them on this quest .	You want your girls .	if
3	12373	And hey then you can get her off track by asking questions about the lord .	She starts asking too many questions about our relationship .	if
0	14110	Kylie moved to the door .	Looked back again for jane .	and
0	30863	They waited for the onslaught of hail to cease .	When it finally did hed seen the white wall of the blizzard easing its was southward and knew if they were to get any supplies they would have to hurry .	and
2	103654	You 're a dead man , '' bennie warned .	His voice quivered when he delivered that boast .	but
3	95368	Can you blame me ? '' .	I 'm so fearful of you .	if
2	19198	Like all firms , trent and brent carries malpractice insurance .	It has a limit .	but
3	153144	It might answer the questions that had been troubling him .	He could find it .	if
1	51637	And how foolish of him to have worried .	He was not getting the recognition that he thought he had deserved .	because
0	4449	He slammed a heavy box down on the counter , his eyes red rimmed with anger and frustration .	Put his hand flat on its top .	and
2	39607	I opened my mouth .	He caught the lobe of my ear between his teeth , and my words were lost in a moan .	but
0	42509	She broke his gaze , pulling .	Luke released his hold on her arm to step a few feet .	and
2	19631	Between you and me , i 'd like to give her a lot more than that . '' .	She seemed pretty uptight .	but
3	107140	The other would harm or kill her .	He fired at any of them .	if
3	103037	I would love to take her along with me .	You would consent to it .	if
0	115252	But , well , with those round , flushed cheeks .	Slight build , tien did look like a boy half his age .	and
0	60127	He 'd accepted my logic .	I could finally taste him in my mouth .	and
2	66959	She was al smiles for the woman taking tickets .	She remained cool toward aidan as they made their way down the jetway to the plane .	but
4	42297	She 'd been the psychiatrist on duty .	I 'd gone looking for them .	when
0	141766	Andrea hoisted the sword jared , and crouched next to jared .	Ran back to dylan .	and
0	102199	I stirred up the last bit of courage i had as i stared into the anguished face i loved beyond reason , my friends , and everything .	Continued , `` i 'll tell paul that i ran away-that i was tired of school .	and
1	130841	Yes , i can have a drink on friday .	He 'll be there to watch over me .	because
3	123182	... '' his words trailed off when she narrowed her eyes .	Finch 's letter holds water .	if
0	34128	He 'll somehow combine her power with his .	Use it to control everyone .	and
3	80165	He grumbled , hed have thought to bring a wrench .	That forty-foot sail hadnt distracted him .	if
2	130463	Her body instantly froze .	She had no time to have any further reaction as a sound came from the door .	but
0	125332	They were good at what they did .	Were happy right where they were .	and
2	130598	`` mayhap you should stay lying down for a bit , '' charlie murmured .	He shook his head and forced himself to his feet where he swayed .	but
3	127306	We are way more likely to find stuff then just checking here and there as we move .	We spend time combing over areas .	if
4	32034	I was feeling a little dozy .	The knock came on the door .	when
2	139150	Rifles were strapped to their backs .	He was unable to discern make and type .	but
2	40685	Her feet shifted just an inch as if she was still unsure .	He already decided he 'd waited too long to claim her .	but
0	57231	This , so i just grabbed the ball .	Motioned for him to go .	and
0	56516	He flies a short distance away from me , but as i look at him he does nothing but sit there and stare at me .	I prepare myself for him to throw a fireball .	and
2	39784	It must have been an unpleasant way for tolliver to start the day .	He eased back on the couch .	but
3	34221	Spend a week with him .	You think you walked far today .	if
2	47420	The world was big , and .	The elephant was huge .	but
0	79008	The door to the kitchen was just outside the bar area at the west end .	I stuck my head in the door to say hi to sweetie .	and
0	87264	`` you told me what you wanted . '' .	Then you made the mistake of assuming i agreed .	and
0	58678	A few months ago , titans had overthrown the greeks .	Seized control of the divine throne .	and
2	58334	I knew they involved forgiveness .	That was the only one i could come up with .	but
0	40408	To drive back to chicago .	Pack up his apartment .	and
2	123298	I was familiar with casting trances .	Simply using it to commune with a substance was a bit more difficult .	but
0	129266	Her shoulder clipped his forearm .	Instead of stumbling back , he never moved an inch .	and
2	23565	Who he knew was angry and then slowly nodded in angels direction .	Was also , like him , past caring .	but
2	15153	Eustace met his gaze for several seconds .	Then faltered and looked .	but
0	34441	He glanced up at the single window .	Then dragged the heavy chest across the room to stand on so that he could see out .	and
0	54607	She picks up another gun .	Tucks it into her belt .	and
2	59461	There was something sad and dark about it .	At the same time a ray of hope pierced the darkness and shone through the half-closed doors .	but
2	4164	Sidereal looked at me , his dark eyes reflecting the fire and turning red , like a demon 's with round pupils .	I cleared my throat , and .	but
0	73744	Katarina fox was abusing human life .	This madness had to stop .	and
2	85428	Jerry pointed to the mans hat and jerry realized the man knew nothing of how the game worked .	Asked him about his love for baseball .	but
2	105985	They were enemies of the milgari .	The enemies of your enemies were not always your friends .	but
2	116034	It 's all right , she wanted to say , and she thought he might be .	Jem 's eyes were shut .	but
4	55393	Where he said they were going to chill out i distinctly heard a womans voice speak up in a joking manner .	Mr. johnson got to the part .	when
0	110545	With that , he left the room .	She turned her attention back to the tv .	and
1	11374	Rann never ever follows the rules .	He makes up his own.just like me .	because
0	15010	But gideon slid a finger between her lips .	Broke the seal so that her mouth popped off his neck .	and
2	147264	I suppose i am , she laughed .	Thats our little secret , okay .	but
2	119326	Why their lives were shorter than those of their dissolute cousins to the north , who gave nothing .	Only took from this world they had come to for sanctuary and then claimed by force .	but
0	29860	He climbed out with fredrick .	Gingerly stepped across the hidden path of stones .	and
3	151898	She 'd be rallying a football team .	She was any peppier .	if
2	64856	Just you said about steve and the picture i didnt notice .	It was something about way he ran , and the smell .	but
0	104471	She was holding to the one power .	Hide her from her enemy .	and
0	60544	She stopped held it up to zacharel 's lips .	Pinched a piece from the edge of what remained of the second confection .	and
0	19622	She quickly scanned it : thus comes the battle of the glory , between the oral and the servant lord of his blood .	Suddenly gasped as she read the last passages .	and
1	146836	She was making the decision to give him up to the system .	She felt that , given the pervasiveness of his needs , she was unable to care for him .	because
4	41669	He is a fun guy .	He is in them .	when
3	65764	And how exactly would he bring that up .	The situation arose where they happened to find themselves naked .	if
2	137552	There was the glock .	Aside from the spare magazine , the rest of her ammunition-an entire brick-was gone , along with the rest of her gear .	but
3	51032	Dom and gage might get the wrong idea .	I walked around with a boner all day .	if
0	86649	Grabbing a fistful of coli 's hair , putting her in a tight head lock with my other arm .	Pulling her to me .	and
1	9957	The reason i was their favorite bartender was ! '' .	I was the only one who could make the drinks girly enough for them .	because
2	63442	They had all offered to carry on .	She wanted time to herself to digest all the information .	but
2	86115	I dont know the rest .	I open my mouth and these words come out , seemingly of their own accord .	but
2	84746	It was her job to answer phones and things of that nature , she was not a detective .	She couldnt help but to examine the man who stood before her .	but
3	71145	To lie about it .	Anything unraveled before he got to them .	if
4	105564	Death is not an unexpected outcome .	One chooses my line of work .	when
2	42698	Henrietta , i know this is difficult .	The threat is over for .	but
2	158428	Will had wanted me to see this room .	I had no idea why .	but
0	128121	She loves you also but said that she was stepping aside for you to take her place in my life . '' .	Really does love me .	and
0	62885	Roland walked past them .	They shrank away from him .	and
2	107940	She tried to think of something clever .	Her mind went blank .	but
0	105352	Victor smiled at my taking his arm .	Then we began to walk into the restaurant .	and
2	42463	Admittedly , my response was robotically lazy and cold .	I didnt want to pretend to care more about his predicament more than the one currently confronting me .	but
4	144663	She turned to walk back to the sofa and ran directly into kevin 's broad chest .	She finally had herself back under control .	when
0	81539	A chill scuttles across my shoulders .	I wish duval had not made such a vow .	and
3	81217	Ill draw attention to myself .	I create a complete shield .	if
0	149597	At one point i glanced over to cole .	He was just - looking at me .	and
3	66385	To keep on top of this .	I 'm going to pass that physical .	if
2	126498	Owen lars was patient .	That had its limits .	but
4	94827	However i knew immediately they were caste vamps .	Ziggy let me know the vamps you were fighting were using magic .	when
2	153732	There would be hell to pay .	He would worry about it when the time came .	but
4	98768	`` hey , grant , '' shelby said .	He finally stopped in front of us .	when
3	79401	And with his track record in life , it would be nice .	He could prove to family he was trustworthy before he started thinking about a woman .	if
0	97732	They were on their own .	All they had was on their backs .	and
4	103544	To slowly pull them off .	My brain decides to work .	when
3	975	I wondered , but teeg 's next words stopped me .	Turning thifilatha would do any good .	if
0	110768	Rhea 's hand flew up to her mouth .	A gasp escaped her .	and
2	134885	I do feel some anger toward her .	I was trying to ignore that .	but
3	138153	How soon would it be he went after pets .	Sidney carter was branching out .	if
2	148733	She looked into his eyes for one long moment , wanting to kiss him .	Elijah was watching them .	but
2	18899	Mccarthy to finish - it sounded as if he had more to say .	The man just swung his feet into bed and pulled the covers up .	but
0	82262	Castor has a word with me about contraception .	Puts a little coil thing inside my womb that he says will stop any unwanted babies .	and
2	59811	Nugg tried to point to the problem .	The look in master 's eyes was very dangerous .	but
2	73724	It lacked a little something without the lace and velvet , and i tightened my hold on the ley lines as a sheet of black-tinted ever-after coalesced into a hunched shape right there on the patio .	His eyes still glowed with the pleasure of doing something no one else could .	but
3	24605	The last thing he needed was a gang of useless dead-weights hanging around his neck , slowing him down and messing up his plans .	He was to have any hope to ambush his captors in the morning and borrow their boat .	if
2	118687	Colt had never worked with the feds , went to conferences , read shit about it .	He knew some guys who had .	but
2	21882	Wherever declan is , not pine for him the whole time .	I 've got to enjoy my night out with .	but
4	93249	He would want to sit by me in the front row .	There are seats open in the back row where the popular kids sit .	when
3	22457	'' i hear him tell the others .	You so much as snicker , i will kill you all .	if
3	125312	`` , you 're crazy .	You think i 'd distract bianca while we 're in a known vampire hunting zone .	if
0	56899	Billy pulled a camera from under a seat .	Took pictures as they moved through the trees .	and
3	148486	Making illusion spells for a spooky house , who wouldlisten to her , let alone believe her .	Even she did talk .	if
3	129704	Then again , bill was known to do some pretty off-character things from time to time .	It meant getting some authentic detail into a story he was writing .	if
2	32692	He 'd be furious for a few days .	Sooner or later he 'd want to talk this out-right .	but
4	21573	Of course , there were minor malfunctions .	The electro-cuffs were first developed .	when
0	90101	As the shots got closer to her , she threw her arms towards them .	Created a barrier that absorb the shots .	and
4	140097	Where i got just a glimpse .	Your shirt came up .	when
2	131115	He jerked his body to the right .	Rammed into another uniformed body .	but
3	97034	Maybe he could talk dad into going there at least on saturday .	There was not much homework dustin was going there with friends almost every day this week .	if
2	138320	She clearly wanted to say something .	Was caught in a quandary .	but
4	91254	To examine it more closely he encountered an impenetrable black , sickly , chaotic , lifeless stench .	He extended his senses .	when
2	77333	She 'd abandoned it by a jenga-tower display of organic biscotti cookies .	Now it was gone .	but
2	152078	She even debated polishing her nails .	The past two days of scrubbing and hauling trash had taken their toll in ragged , broken ones so she opted for filing them down smooth and massaging in a lot of cuticle cream .	but
0	55855	We jumped down from our bar stools without another word .	Followed amory into the living room .	and
3	158526	She would run screaming from his presence .	He told her she had actually found one .	if
0	84323	He got up from the bed .	Began pacing the room .	and
3	101257	What would you say ? '' .	Xavier makes a move on you and sneaks into your bedroom for some midnight fun .	if
2	40460	I hope it will take us to america , to the olympiaes location .	I do not have any faith in these things working .	but
0	95999	Under the t-shirts , oversized jogging trousers were worn to hide the leg metal .	Then vin placed new track shoes over his new metal feet .	and
0	70443	In the smithy , a few miles outside pagford , gavin hughes soaped himself under a hot shower .	Wondered why he had never had the courage of other men , and how they managed to make the right choices among almost infinite alternatives .	and
0	91582	The trading post being above the vineyard on the map .	Had to hope the drawing was accurate .	and
3	155923	She might actually give us the boot . '' .	She knew what i was really helping you with .	if
2	90522	A single rat with a massive dose lived nearly three minutes .	He also succumbed in the end .	but
1	31271	If having a robot as a husband is unusual even on aurora , that would be .	Robots like jander are unusual .	because
2	24514	Sure , a fan could slip underneath one of the busses .	We were in a segregated parking lot on venue property .	but
0	153917	Maybe ruth got it .	Is using it all on sky .	and
0	118746	This do i hear , denethor son of ecthelion , lord of gondor , steward of the high king , and i will not forget it , nor . ' .	Fail to reward that which is given : fealty with love , valour with honour , oath-breaking with vengeance .	and
2	65490	He 's a little on the skinny side considering i 'm big-boned , so everything should even out by august . '' .	I 'm planning on losing twenty pounds this summer .	but
2	99788	She raised her hand as if to touch me .	Lowered it again when she noticed my shoulders pull .	but
3	25629	`` , it 's no choice at all . '' .	You have to choose between certain death and possible death .	if
4	135988	He beat a hasty retreat .	Our reporter asked him about the latest details of his never-confirmed and often-denied relationship with actress grace sheridan .	when
0	132236	Rome 's arms jerked .	I saw a thin silver wire was secured inside the circle .	and
2	106608	She came rising up off the bed .	He kept her hips pinned down .	but
3	45427	It was a rehearsal for a later main effort .	Even this was just a token hunt .	if
4	57750	I would barely recognize her .	I finally saw her .	when
0	51683	You 're having a boy and a girl , when they 're due .	Allow you to hear their heartbeats .	and
4	99831	You like it , and i like it when you lose control for me .	I let you control me .	when
0	125907	Before she even knew how it happened , he had hauled her to her feet .	Had her against a near-by tree .	and
3	141534	The heir should be found and eliminated .	These two recruits pan out as the covenant would indicate .	if
2	52843	Nails and eyeballs are all very well . '' .	We still want an agreed hourly rate .	but
0	51889	To drown in her vast green sea like eyes .	Forget all my distant troubles .	and
3	45503	What we 're doing .	You actually believe . '' .	if
0	93122	He interrupted her midway through .	Asked her to continue in arabic , which she did .	and
2	18407	There were hundreds of questions in philip 's mind .	He knew the answer to that query for a certainty .	but
3	147443	Christine would have ended their relationship on the spot .	Raoul had written her something like that .	if
4	55738	Then gasped in shock .	He lifted his tail .	when
2	124390	Misari and alanki are fighting a stranger , i can not move , and .	You she paused , frowning as though noticing something for the first time .	but
0	17702	Bill was on his cell phone before the words had finished leaving frannie 's mouth .	I was left gaping at him .	and
0	59208	In that instant , shahara remembered herself .	Why she 'd come .	and
2	130727	I tried to see exactly why everyone was so excited .	None of it made sense .	but
2	128191	Maynard looked around to see if there was anything else they might be seeing .	He heard and saw nothing in the growing darkness .	but
2	128854	He was enraged at shimura for allowing torothex to be killed .	He contained that emotion , has he had so many others .	but
4	140401	Partitioned out in 1948 if you believe the arab line , forcibly displaced .	Nearly a million people were .	when
0	64695	Benny walked over to the crate .	Opened it removing square bombs and two small portable drilling machines .	and
0	129317	He preached daily at the consecrated dais he knelt before , shared his vision spread the word of god .	Reached out to his flock .	and
4	26214	They were close friends .	You were with them .	when
0	154389	Head no longer poked .	Ethan shrugged to open his bedroom door .	and
0	2667	Go find that russian general . '' .	Tell him we had better arrange supply for another two days .	and
0	90505	`` i 'm supposed to give him to you ... but . '' .	I might break the rules and keep you .	and
0	158390	He stepped from his hiding place .	Fled back the way he had come-directly past the embrasure where garion had concealed himself .	and
4	17209	She would be carefully building up defenses and training new recruits . '' .	Others would be scheming .	when
0	136248	Eventually they were gone .	Charlie collapsed to his knees in pain .	and
2	68613	She slanted a baleful glance at him .	Withdrew her questing fingers from the door handle .	but
3	143540	`` , he will jump .	Your big mouth makes the coon jump .	if
3	139105	To take lethal action .	You do not comply .	if
2	55545	I closed my eyes in an attempt to sleep away my anger and get some rest before work tomorrow .	My phone vibrated on the small nightstand beside me .	but
4	23792	His lips had just parted with their surprised inhalation , working them .	My mouth covered them .	when
0	135085	The lie would change his mind .	He 'd lied to her plenty .	and
2	92097	He started to walk .	Stopped , looking back at the woman carved of long and graceful lines .	but
2	55400	They could have stayed at his home in the hills .	Her room was only blocks away from the studio .	but
2	45890	`` hate to be the bearer of bad news . '' .	I think we 're being kept in the dark about a lot of what 's cooking .	but
2	139507	Maybe he was too far away from pru .	Gus seemed to actually communicate with the people .	but
2	123174	A nervous laugh falls from her mouth .	She goes silent when she sees max 's stare .	but
2	58134	He had worried that she was so reluctant to go .	Now he wanted her to stay .	but
3	66224	I wouldnt have to do this .	I trusted you to do the right thing .	if
4	48523	We must have still been in the sub-levels .	We entered the liftmy mind .	when
2	4172	You 're normally whining to have a later curfew . '' .	It 's not even nine .	but
1	96589	When to save something .	It was going to come .	because
4	29302	To think about jason .	She was with tosh .	when
0	138544	Well adapt our menu to current tastes lives .	Stop worrying about other peoples .	and
0	133920	Over-dramatically suffering the pangs of unrequited love .	Pondering - ponderously , of course - the banalities of their supposed religion .	and
3	143212	Steer gently to your right .	You want it to move .	if
2	94355	She wanted to scream at him that there was no way she could take anything like this .	At the last second verity regained her self-control .	but
0	142513	She moved into the kitchen to make breakfast .	Felt something wet spill down her thighs .	and
2	86755	Suddenly a piercing shriek rose from the bedroom .	The wail was not that of his wife , but of another soul .	but
0	106907	Perhaps you should rest .	Then you still think that she exists .	and
4	141253	The morris family would have returned .	She returned to the door .	when
2	158171	He hit the brakes .	With the engine dead , they didnt respond .	but
0	23423	17 chloe looked out the window of the plane .	Contemplated the fantasy landscape that was the las vegas strip .	and
2	111653	She was going to be hopelessly late because phillip would be ringing her doorbell at any moment .	She just had to validate her find .	but
2	88912	And i appreciated patrick 's loyalty to his family .	We 'd need more than words and assurances .	but
3	139051	I will buy him a flight ticket and send him .	The situation gets worse after one week .	if
0	147210	Him watching me run from the snow .	Wishing he could do something , anything , to help me .	and
0	22668	Injecting himself with pain relief he continued to lay there , alone , unable to move , just watching as the land cruisers slowly came closer .	Being bitten , time after time after time .	and
4	54789	But my good mood faltered .	Ivy turned the corner .	when
0	52187	Magic comes from emotions .	Terror is handy fuel .	and
3	40358	He could 've just summoned the enemy to the courtyard .	He was going to do that .	if
4	18363	This woman must have been the mother of a baby that died at childbirth and she was looking for her baby .	The home had been the home for unwed mothers .	when
0	68770	I went to my room , staring at the rotating ceiling fan until dawn claimed me .	Lay on my back on the double bed .	and
0	109530	If not for her , i could just disappear with bones .	Live the rest of my life with the man i loved .	and
4	56945	Which will probably be viewed as the beginning of earths violent climate change .	Placed in historical context .	when
3	156372	She 'd be a glacial shelf in the arctic .	She could be any colder .	if
2	40716	Once i tried to rush up to him to hug him .	No matter how fast i ran he was always in the back and i was always at the altar .	but
2	91539	I stroked his face he kept his mouth closed .	Tried to give him water .	but
0	3968	You had any sword experience .	Put you here by default .	and
0	112595	She vividly saw bitterness .	How she blamed them both for what happened to her mother , her brothers and herself .	and
0	50205	So i wrapped my legs around his body .	Let him slide deep inside .	and
1	29850	Their relationship was only a few weeks old .	Mandi and sergio were so connected .	because
4	136114	She put on a what , me .	Rowe caught liaos glance .	when
0	125944	Otherwise it will be forgotten .	It will all happen .	and
2	58119	I would never have thought of any stranger saying something like that to me .	When he did , it sounded terrifyingly right .	but
2	95761	It was not her grandmother and she was sure it was that of an old woman .	It was not the voice of anyone she had heard .	but
2	154844	She had always been an early bird and shed never had to work so hard in-between before and her mind and body were paying .	Had barely ever been to bed before the light had long since faded .	but
2	92555	`` i still think that this is work for the grays , '' tesan said .	She sounded less convinced than she had just moments before .	but
0	137535	I turned her around in the expansive box stall .	Walked her into the corridor .	and
3	125622	What do you suppose they could do it .	We had a really good swimmer .	if
0	116923	The implications as each of them surged forward into the room , hoping to find something to eat or drink .	Began digging through the boxes .	and
0	86520	`` now , if you 'll excuse us ... '' rhys led me out of the room .	Closed the door behind us .	and
0	12316	Fifteen minutes later , she pulled up to the caldwell galleria .	She almost forgot to lock up the lexus as she strode over to the entryway of the food court .	and
2	83019	She thought he was going to stand up .	Instead she felt the touch of his fingers on the top of her hand .	but
0	69400	Myra peered into the woman 's mind .	Sensed a lack of trust .	and
2	19790	I knew it was because they cared .	It still drove me mad .	but
0	133222	Gollum says not . ' .	Once i agree with him .	and
3	149029	He 'd never understand .	I explained it to him .	if
0	97203	Shattering it like a matchstick .	Causing the wooden top to tilt to one side .	and
2	63698	I got a good price for the trees . '' .	They want the lot .	but
2	28763	Reached out to touch his shoulder .	He stepped back out of my reach .	but
0	149315	Danika peeked over the rail .	Laughed bitterly , a little .	and
3	133775	It would never be .	Even he drained her dry .	if
3	111511	`` , it was not tightly buried ... ... '' `` no , no .	You could clean it with a fingertip .	if
4	104245	To imagined she was anything special .	She thought about how many women ryder slept with in a year or a month or even a typical week .	when
2	158463	I turned to look at her .	She stared resolutely at her paper .	but
0	31988	Him and filbert took an open-top wagon .	Left with the prisoner over an hour .	and
0	138662	He put his rough hand out .	Eliza shook on it .	and
3	59145	It 'd be much more fun , so much more fun , '' she repeated in a husky whisper , `` .	You were my slave .	if
0	14233	Quick as a wink , she swiftly took the blade .	Did the same up the inside of my other leg .	and
1	36089	Youd better kill me quickly , stranger your neck is the first one that ill break , i snarled .	I ever get out of .	because
2	41104	The boy was wearing a lovely suit .	Now had his arms wrapped about mouse 's neck .	but
2	109956	Gabrielle had always loved sex , especially with him .	When they were younger , it had always been a fast , missionary kind of thing .	but
0	158285	Erin 's slender hand reached .	Touched the shifter 's chest .	and
4	75812	He 'd met her for the first time a few months ago and he remembered being utterly startled by her angelic appearance .	She 'd come to the compound to see abby .	when
0	13077	He had forgotten all about the gruelmoff , in fact , after what happened with jawen calling him a balnor .	His running off into the forest .	and
2	51633	Thorpe refused to take from her .	He would gladly give .	but
4	92404	I looked out the window toward the pool house .	I got out of the shower .	when
2	73155	Once that had been established , we attempted to narrow down the location of these individuals , particularly grevane . '' .	Met with very limited success .	but
2	114478	She explained it to me as feeling like period cramps , she wasnt in pain .	She wasnt too comfortable .	but
0	158109	She followed the crowd .	Learned what the lighted signals meant and when it would be safe to cross the street .	and
3	60995	Then they are right , but their use of those events as a means of manipulation is still wrong .	Those events did transpire .	if
2	113092	Tammy 's eyes widened .	She carried on listening .	but
0	22864	I run my fingers through my hair .	Gather it out of my face .	and
4	70973	I relaxed and moved to sit on the edge of the bed .	I heard the squeak of springs in a room above my head .	when
2	127129	Themselves moving sideways every few minutes .	Vianez had been on target with her guess of two hours even if the experience had left everyone , even cyprian , dizzy .	but
2	145841	They 're a division one school .	They 'll never get close to a national championship .	but
2	24040	Mr tulip parroted the sentence without thinking .	It was coming back now in the total recall of the dead , from a vantage point of two feet off the ground and three years of age .	but
2	106443	I wanted to scream and scream until my throat couldnt take it .	Oddly , it felt like it would just take more energy than i had .	but
4	132507	I drew a breath .	I realized what he was about to do .	when
0	141761	`` calling loon , '' nik greeted her with a bright smile .	Approached the bed to squeeze her hand .	and
0	145157	The roadworthiness of taxicabs depends upon their kind of maintenance and the use to which they are subjected .	Therefore , their actual physical condition should be taken into consideration at the time of registration .	and
0	124221	She hopped dexterously over sing , threw me to the ground behind the filing cabinet .	Then grabbed me by the arm .	and
2	62154	Patrick had never considered the possibility of marrying veronique .	His failure to have done so had nothing to do with her attending religious services on saturdays rather than on sundays .	but
2	121913	Then almost whined , `` why .	Katricia asked with alarm and ? '' .	but
3	103556	He will trash it .	He can get his hands on it , and out in the shed at the airfield that 's easy .	if
1	83825	The only reason she was at the beach at all was .	She was on vacation with ramsey 's family .	because
0	54184	Tears burned the back of my eyes .	When i spoke , my voice was hoarse .	and
2	274	It 's true i 'm .	You know me , penny .	but
3	93368	It would do him immeasurable good .	The veterans got a better pension .	if
4	99768	She banged it a second time .	There was no response .	when
4	74196	Some men looked at each other .	They heard him quote the price .	when
0	153182	She flipped the lock said , `` we 're closed . '' .	Pulled the door open .	and
2	125843	Oh , stop it , t. '' she blushes , slapping me across the shoulder .	Clearly flattered by my comment .	but
0	80394	He had to get that package .	He couldnt just walk away and let sneed fall back into his fantasy prison .	and
0	127555	`` it will be all right , '' she assured him soothingly , squeezing him .	He glanced at her sharply to find her giving him a reassuring look .	and
0	42892	It seemed as if the majority of queenslanders knew a baited trap when they saw one .	They were capable of convincing their comrades , with a clenched first if necessary .	and
4	154970	He added , `` but the greatest swordsman in the history of the world surely knows how . '' .	He regained control of himself .	when
1	7079	With time , the pain was becoming more bearable .	Even only she was learning to compartmentalize it away from the rest of her sensory input .	because
2	69152	Thousands of birds inside me begin their sudden migration .	There 's no way out .	but
2	141663	He 'd been rescued , thanks to cole lennox , either .	Nothing had been able to banish his darkness .	but
4	72414	How dare you cast eyes on her .	I had forbidden it .	when
0	132320	The small black claw slid back under the pressure of her forceps .	A drop of opaque goo swelled around it .	and
4	107721	It 's time to change it up .	A twelve-year-old tells you the weapon you have sucks .	when
4	56221	To make an apologetic face .	He looked my way .	when
2	100595	I 'd heard it .	Prior to now i was always one of the people making the noise .	but
2	27761	She tried to endure the pain as long as possible .	Recently it had become .	but
0	30928	Theran scratched his head .	Resisted the temptation to pull out some hair .	and
0	94342	To put me up in some super secret chamber .	Lock me away from everyone and everything .	and
0	33489	All the necessary formalities had been carried out .	Their bodies were released .	and
0	128819	But again , he felt that he could change his mind .	This was not a decision that he should make without taking much more time to think about it .	and
4	72622	What she would say to sheena .	She called her but then decided just to tell her everything .	when
0	42033	There 's a sea current that comes down from the far north .	It carries those large ice floes down from the eternal ice .	and
0	115988	Pierce had beaten her up last spring .	That was not easy for the self-assured woman .	and
3	45313	Perhaps , then it was also possible that members of grey cliff had done the transporting , and therefore there might be some reason why jeremy needed to be punished .	Jeremy had been telling the truth and he had been transported to this location in a box .	if
0	158144	`` there are some things that need to be attended to . '' .	This is likely to take me a few weeks .	and
3	23426	I 'll tell you . '' .	It 's no good or .	if
4	143447	He knew the scene before him would prove indelible , lasting through even an immortal 's lifetime .	He returned to the campsite after a hard run .	when
2	11747	He could have mesmerized her while she was .	It was easier this way .	but
2	159551	Could you have the site and the house right ? '' .	Still be wrong about us .	but
4	83111	She 's still coming .	I stand and press my erection against her hand .	when
3	114907	She had to be alive .	She felt this miserable .	if
0	100324	There , i think , he will hear tidings of war , and .	The riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith .	and
2	45948	Not all of them would please him .	Susannah vowed she 'd hold nothing .	but
1	147339	I crossed my arms over my breasts .	He was ogling them .	because
0	92760	I left a note for alcide telling him i was taking a walk .	Then i rode down in the elevator with a man in casual clothes , lugging a golf bag .	and
0	29912	You are alpha here . '' .	Your duty is to your pack .	and
4	59826	Not at all surprised .	The mage continued his terrified charge .	when
3	3774	You 're part of barak 's organization .	That 's the word .	if
2	145063	As for the service itself , i tried to tell if the communion wine was lower quality .	I couldnt tell the difference .	but
2	8431	Before prateek can answer , i 'm pulled up the stairs and .	Pushed into one of the trailers .	but
2	14560	I 'll shoot you a text and . '' .	Let you know at the end of the week .	but
3	41483	I would have never sent kevin out .	I had known my parents were going to be .	if
3	70646	It would be almost unbearable to look upon her .	The light had been .	if
2	34389	He wanted it all along .	Did not make the challenge for such .	but
0	78478	Nichole looked at me and then to the man , she smiled .	Her gaze returned to me .	and
2	69860	I am playing hide-and-seek with the divergent . '' .	I 'm not the only person who 's `` it .	but
2	42556	This monstrous beast waiting like this .	We only thought it was basking in the sun .	but
1	57773	To shove her in the friend zone .	All his commanding officer told him to .	because
3	61693	They may well be useful .	I may speak from my own experience as a boy .	if
1	86116	`` '' she grumbled .	Every case is important .	because
0	101389	She lowered her lips to shadow 's lips .	She breathed into his lungs , a gentle in and out , and then the breath became a kiss .	and
4	30771	So was a bit shocked and said , `` .	Bethany arched an eyebrow .	when
2	137227	He opened his eyes a crack .	Shut them quickly against the painful stab of white light .	but
4	119141	She wrote few new songs .	She was in lohagarh and sang them to ashfaq and his first wife naureen .	when
0	113606	We were soul mates before we shared a soul .	We 'll be soul mates after .	and
1	138071	Once she was working and making money her parents were happy to have her visit .	There were things they wanted that they couldnt afford and she gave them money so she could have quiet visits with her brother/son noah and after a while .	because
2	141707	The man groaned loudly , startling both of them , and he laid his head back against the bed .	Then a relieved hiss slipped through his teeth .	but
0	44381	The toggle switches back down and turn the ignition switch to .	Hit the power button .	and
0	59792	Hesitating by the laminated table .	Taking in the ticking clock .	and
2	50277	Almost choked on my bite .	Continued to eat as if we were having a business conversation .	but
0	154356	Heretofore grabbed cribbins 's arm .	Towed him forcibly out of the room .	and
0	16195	Tray suddenly turned into a driveway .	Pulled around to the back of one of the slightly larger homes , which was demurely clad in white siding .	and
0	110985	Oh , god , it was so good .	She was so lost .	and
2	137327	Saying his name was like running razor blades over my tongue .	I had to do this .	but
2	129456	Sinclair told his fingers to release her .	Instead , he pulled her closer , bending her arm until her wrist and his hand were just below her chin .	but
0	88825	To take them back to the village .	Keep them at their house .	and
2	39779	Dion looked like he was about to say more on the subject .	Then he sighed softly , and they drove back down the road and over small wooden bridges and past a golf course .	but
2	25439	I was so nervous before the show i wasnt sure if i could do it .	Once i started telling our story it got easier , matt replied .	but
0	45997	Then she picked up her knife and fork .	Began to eat with single-minded intensity .	and
3	108726	Lee might have won .	Not suffering from quinine poisoning .	if
0	21243	I felt the compulsion kick in .	Heard my mouth say , `` hell no , you idiot , i 'm not all right .	and
3	13788	The answer must have shown on my face .	Even i refused to voice it .	if
4	113578	He has a liking towards this young fellow .	He lets himself feel it .	when
2	77279	Biffy kept breathing , and .	So long as biffy kept breathing , lord maccon resolutely continued his repetitive action : bite , lick , bite , lick .	but
4	40647	But , they were practically throwing her a party .	Shed taken out the guy with the rocket launcher .	when
0	73350	Kissing my throat , he picked me up in his arms .	Carried me back to his quarters .	and
3	65245	And , parrish would get the papers , and she would end up dead .	She turned herself in .	if
3	98348	They dont need to prove it by getting married .	Two people love each other .	if
3	130713	How frost or galen would take it .	The ring chose someone other than him .	if
0	122393	He exhaled harshly , but his eyes did not leave mine .	His shoulders slumped forward in defeat .	and
2	28711	He had the words now the conversation had moved on .	It was too late .	but
0	16544	He bowed his head .	Said a silent prayer while i sat .	and
0	118385	Chapter one kylie galen looked up from the slice of pepperoni pizza on the fine china plate .	Tried to ignore the ghost swinging the bloody sword right behind her grandfather and great-aunt .	and
3	53538	She would be appalled and find nothing positive to attach to it .	Someone were to describe the incident to her .	if
0	114326	My tiny candle flame crumbled .	Seemed to turn to dust .	and
2	142244	I 'd touched him to get him on my side at the game friday night .	That was before i .	but
2	9078	They reached the shoreline well before him .	They waited for him to catch them .	but
0	129047	To her surprise , lani was among them .	Left without a single word .	and
2	149494	His tone was casual .	My face burned up .	but
3	147548	Do you mind ? '' .	I just go to bed .	if
0	6330	The time passed he felt no searing sensation of flesh removal he chanced a glance and fainted in relief .	Which would render him to pieces but .	and
0	72119	I set the drink and cocktail napkin on the table in front of mr. carmichael .	I returned with a little bowl of snack mix .	and
0	108955	Emell was talking to lania .	She was pushing her hair .	and
0	50753	I 'd watched a late-night episode or twelve it was pretty good in a totally inaccurate and trashy way .	I 'd never admit it out loud , but .	and
3	19293	Jehovah will force you to follow a bunch of commands you may not like .	You become oath brothers .	if
2	37072	One of the girls and men tried to follow .	They got held up by the crowd .	but
2	19038	He was a mind changer himself , weaker than kaylee or april .	He and april working on kaylee together might just get through .	but
2	24550	Worried for a moment about him swimming with his arm in a sling .	He used a lazy side stroke that used his good arm to propel him through the water .	but
2	135116	Seeing the beginnings of a dysfunctional family has its own appeal , and .	I hope you enjoy it .	but
1	125293	Couldnt bear to look up at her in that moment .	I suddenly felt so overwhelmingly unprepared .	because
0	150113	To return home but first i have to navigate the market .	Transcribe my notes into typewritten pages .	and
0	73313	With the time we lost in the storm and this rather large detour weve taken , our fuel will be low our daylight gone .	That was the intention , but .	and
0	117784	His black hair and blue eyes were striking .	He bore a remarkable resemblance to the man she had seen through sasha 's eyes .	and
4	139610	Them sound like knights on horseback .	They flew in a horde as they were at the moment .	when
2	153868	I didnt mean to eat your food .	I was so hungry .	but
0	98948	Then he bent his head to brush his lips against hers , gently disentangled himself from her arms .	Followed his brother to the study .	and
4	41833	I was halfway to the temple of isis .	I realized the discomfort of confronting this filthy street in bare feet .	when
1	102749	I had made the timer particularly short .	It made me feel more secure .	because
0	26845	`` i 'm in love with sam , '' heven said .	Surprisingly , i felt better .	and
3	27601	But , you 're going to love it .	It 's anything like my bow and arrows .	if
0	20276	She had bought in faid , knowing that she must make it last until she reached sfax .	A few bites from the rations .	and
0	23861	They abutted no water .	Were thus considered the sheltered states .	and
0	57034	Brian motioned for kim to follow him out .	He shut the door behind them .	and
1	99826	When i forced her to go to mcdonald 's with me .	I was starving after nothing but chocolate bars for lunch .	because
2	78369	It hurt like hell .	He knew it was either take off the arm or be hog food .	but
0	99654	She 'd urged him on , like some wild creature .	Then reveled in his strength .	and
2	144015	Audrey had left when katryn got .	Was back in time for katryn to go to volleyball .	but
4	68146	Flat on my palm , i think it did feel lighter but i wasnt sure .	I held it in my hand .	when
0	9642	When the door suddenly opened .	Jaenelle popped into the room .	and
3	32506	Anyway like phil and i were , youre not going to worry about portaging .	Youre going out into georgian bay .	if
0	65078	The fool had been walking toward meg .	Was barely a handful of cars away when that police officer approached her .	and
4	153408	Had warmed up to her even more .	She had kneed zander in the balls after he come on a little too strong .	when
3	153078	What would he do , she wondered .	She just told him the truth .	if
2	55922	Thought maybe he 'd also liked kandace 's assets .	That was his business .	but
0	112261	To beg , bully .	Badger her parents into getting her one .	and
1	153574	I asked her to turn it .	I was going to bed .	because
0	42699	I can pull into the parking lot .	Let you two have a natter on the park bench near the restaurant .	and
2	9960	Yes , hes piloting it , but you didnt answer my questions , thanatos reprimanded .	Kira ignored him as she made her way towards the bridge .	but
2	37057	The water was cold , acknowledged adele .	It quenched her thirst .	but
2	15647	Chris was just an ordinary guy - a construction worker .	He and jennifer had been together for ten years , since before jennifer became famous .	but
0	63184	Human words were faintly distinguishable the voice was that of a woman .	It seemed to come from a great depth , but .	and
0	101475	Andrew picked up a bowl .	Followed his nose to the small cauldron of stew .	and
2	70976	He 'd tried to buy her a pair earlier .	She 'd insisted she could do without them for a few days .	but
0	78927	Tears began running down her plump cheeks .	Annie reached for the box of tissues on the table before her .	and
2	43028	In it , he was once again piloting flight 7 from tokyo to la .	This time the leak was much worse .	but
0	18246	His lips released hers .	He pushed her to his side .	and
3	66528	Would you have killed me ? '' .	I 'd gotten into a better school .	if
4	76388	... '' he shook his head .	I look back at how stupid we both acted .	when
0	85021	He left his pants on and undone as he loosened his hair .	Shook it free to fall around his wide shoulders .	and
4	64538	It was learned that the regular deliveryman was in the hospital , a victim of a hit-and-run driver .	The story was checked out .	when
3	2334	Would we find her faster ? '' .	We took off and did our own thing .	if
0	91521	She smiled moments later and squeezed .	Took his hand in hers .	and
3	79482	I want it to be at his invitation , not some power play of mine .	We ever make love in his bed .	if
1	2478	Im still reaching for her , and logan cant sign .	He has her on one side and me on the other .	because
2	152413	The artist was long forgotten .	His or her craftsmanship lived on .	but
2	59579	They tried jumping her .	They heard a blood curdling scream .	but
2	13782	He 'd had the foresight to move everything to his room .	All his thoughts had been focused on bringing her home .	but
2	79493	Good morning , detective , i said in as controlled and even a voice as possible .	Relief flooded my body .	but
4	113472	It all added up .	He said max kingsley was on your priority list .	when
0	105843	I let out a yelp .	Nearly bounced my car off of a delivery truck .	and
0	4050	I eyed the bundle .	Then looked at the smooth , blank wall between kiyo and me .	and
2	4600	He did okay for his first day .	He has a long way to go .	but
0	106764	Paris closed his eyes , `` we should take this conversation elsewhere . '' .	Reyes shook his head .	and
2	121289	They had forgotten about their worries and now it was back to the harsh reality of the situation .	Impending journey for a couple of hours .	but
3	7894	She looked pretty smashing .	She did say so herself .	if
2	128375	`` you can get it from frozen concentrate .	It 's not the same .	but
0	147211	Which made the woman in the room squeak with surprise .	Drop her corner of the mattress .	and
2	50253	Liz had liked plenty of guys .	It had never felt like this .	but
3	27107	`` '' i say .	One of us falls .	if
0	72781	They lived in the free state of stronghold .	They actually mentioned the men of liberty .	and
4	31900	She bites her tongue .	She realizes she said love .	when
2	132834	Then it seemed to the others that they awakened at his voice as from a dream .	The wind now suddenly grown fierce filled all their sails , and they saw him never again , but were driven back with hearts all broken with regret and longing .	but
2	3816	Cole would believe her .	Anything was better than not knowing .	but
2	155587	Ive got to go , she turned her body from his , intending to walk .	His hand that had been loosely holding her wrist tightened , holding her an arm length away from him .	but
0	32341	About three steps the self-appointed sergeants-at-arms grab him .	Yank him back to his seat .	and
2	153993	Addie stood in the doorway .	Dalton barely spared her a glance .	but
4	23190	The entirety of the hot bunch were milling about with police and firefighters .	We left my place .	when
0	31403	Long story , wolf-boy , '' i said .	Crashed down on the sofa .	and
2	147758	The garment was streamlined and chic .	Included a ruffle around the wrists that he found sexy-a concession to her femininity .	but
3	31285	There will be repercussions , career-ending repercussions , and possibly imprisonment or worse .	We dont get her back .	if
2	31476	She might be the strongest among them , and weakness would get you killed quicker than anything else in ashland .	They could still sense weakness .	but
1	66802	It must have worked , looking only fractionally less afraid .	She scurried to my side .	because
0	113707	The monk adjusted his weight , shifting from one foot to another .	The karcon made his move .	and
3	64854	And , i was the reason she felt like she had to .	She 'd forced me to cheat .	if
0	107371	With caution , she leaned .	Breathed in what appeared to be the keane of the pale one .	and
4	96762	Upside down in the killer wave .	He dropped like a lead weight , smashing hard onto the laboratory floor .	when
0	19251	Dozens of tiny , hot , invisible needles pricked my skin .	My jaw locked even tighter as i struggled to keep my face impassive .	and
2	25689	The bathroom was fine , except that we felt it was a little too small for the size of the house .	As there was only the two of us living in it , we thought it would keep as it was for the time being .	but
4	119069	I had frowned , but everyone laughed and said i was the cutest pregnant woman they 'd seen .	I saw the picture .	when
0	39227	Ribs are a staple of tennessee .	Thats all my mom ate when she was pregnant with me .	and
2	38036	She felt it herself .	Her own private crisis point was coming .	but
4	38074	Thenext morning , i had the chief legalofficer at the base sign it with a lot of other things itsimply got buried in the paper work . '' .	The authorization came in bypouch for countersignature .	when
0	70477	Tonight they seemed to break in upon him with determination .	He found himself unable to resist .	and
0	143370	You have set him an example .	Now he will be a watchman when he grows up .	and
3	142823	Zam did not know .	You were supposed to be able to notice three pounds lost .	if
0	49475	Kosner stood up from the table .	Backed away from the man .	and
0	42185	He glides over to me with a gentle smile .	Wraps an arm around my shoulder .	and
2	38606	My hands are shivering and twitchy .	I feel more in control now that the worst has passed and i am alone on the roof .	but
4	68905	She was fragile like a snowflake on your tongue .	You enjoy the first snow in winter .	when
1	160636	This was probably a celebratory dinner-not .	I dodged a bullet with logan , but because i was back at work , playing the role of dutiful daughter .	because
0	159996	I flopped down on the bed .	Then turned my cheek to face noah .	and
1	125351	You turn off the tub .	It 's fixin ' to spill over .	because
2	23633	People would go into the lift with binky butterworth .	They used the stairs .	but
0	112310	's cut the fake surprise and niceties .	Get down to business .	and
4	137378	He looked like he was on his way to a funeral , but jace just looked tough and dangerous .	Simon wore all black .	when
0	131680	Once everyone else had cleared back out of the conference room , mallory sat in one of the plush chairs .	Motioned for me to kneel down in front of her .	and
4	23667	Therefore , the two tormented individuals can begin to orbit each other like radioactive neutron stars being sucked into a black hole .	The mentally ill and the extremely sensitive meet .	when
0	13367	She then made a face .	Gave a little cry , which caused the woman to draw .	and
2	128653	He didnt object to the suggestion that he would have stolen things had there been any to steal .	He didnt like the idea that i knew about his financial status .	but
2	15016	He sat no closer to her than mather did .	Beth 's awareness of him screamed at her .	but
2	149082	My mother was from the west indies .	My father was an educated english white man , who believed in the use of correct english .	but
0	93698	It was an impressive statement : `` oh , that 's a shame , tae be missin ' the weekend like that , '' .	Did not deserve this reply .	and
0	117944	The transperson takes the exclusions as a painful blow .	Drifts away from him to protect her battered heart .	and
4	51471	Something go and suffer the resulting pain .	One wants to be unselfish and good .	when
4	55697	Will had given it to her , smiling as he 'd fastened it on .	They had been married thirty years .	when
0	137254	Moving the doppelganger bodies away from the cube .	Putting them near the one tree .	and
3	153003	What would 've happened .	Jordan had stayed home from the lake that day .	if
3	130211	On that he would fare much better .	He took to the cross .	if
0	72023	I let him think i was .	I saw him take my money .	and
0	140916	With his thumb he gently depressed the top of the bulb .	The emetanism 's apothos went into effect .	and
2	81040	It took me a bit of time and a bit of influence . '' .	I came up with a name .	but
3	112053	That seem overly suspicious .	Everyone in certain areas suddenly dies .	if
0	8819	Serai looked up from the embroidery in her lap .	Glanced out the window .	and
2	135676	Her situated and she easily accepted the challenge , clawing her fingers through his hair and greedily tasting the contours of his mouth .	His mouth came down on hers in a demand .	but
3	146062	`` , give me the number of someone i can call . '' .	You want to make it another year .	if
0	150410	Confident that his orders would be carried out , he led ceryn and through the front doors .	James up the steps .	and
4	136530	I grabbed her wrist and cursed .	Her hand touched the tip of my head to touch the come , still slowly leaking out .	when
0	10599	Calling into mcmurdo console there , and who was handling barry the same way that he handled everyone else , which barry refused to tolerate .	Rattling the cage of another weary weatherman who was at the communications .	and
2	72272	Adam had not tried to get in touch with jennifer in almost nine months .	She avidly read every newspaper and magazine article about him , and watched him whenever he appeared on television .	but
4	82650	How the twilight casts shadows on her smiling face .	She looks back at me .	when
0	63863	After a moment of silence , his head whipped to the side .	He slunk away , leaving sophie alone in the shadows .	and
2	102114	His dark hair was just going to gray .	His ice blue eyes still held the fire that had inspired me to follow him that long-ago day when he 'd convinced me to leave my fruitless life and venture with him into the unknown .	but
0	147012	We wont just look the other way when it happens .	We also wont participate in any bullying .	and
4	52365	And then the citizen is sentenced to foci .	A citizen is guilty of theft .	when
2	73497	This house was only twelve hundred square feet .	It was the biggest living space he and i had ever had all to ourselves .	but
2	36084	It wasnt the way most people i knew conjured spells in the afterlands .	It certainly worked for him .	but
4	145503	But , you have to stop .	I say you have to stop .	when
2	142985	He started the engine .	Accelerating away from the hotel he shot a glance at nicole , wanting to catch her looking at him .	but
0	94311	We entered the suite .	I tried to keep from gawking like the middle-class apartment dweller that i was .	and
4	14528	But , she had been angrily dismissed from the interview .	Tess had pleaded with the head laundry maid to assign maggie less physical work like sorting and mending .	when
4	9412	That only really looks good .	Hes standing still , or lying still , or doesnt know youre looking at him .	when
2	146136	I thought i heard a shot ring out before i landed .	My version of events is irrelevant .	but
2	49449	She always enjoyed hearing him laugh and seeing him smile .	She knew it would only last until they got .	but
3	105749	Then you can not really refer to it as harnessed , correct .	The magnetic energy is no longer contained .	if
0	6893	We 'll create a stampede of humans . '' .	Run out into the night with them .	and
2	104618	I tried not to smile .	Lately it was impossible not to .	but
2	63943	The touch was light .	It was still enough to get a response out of me .	but
0	3007	Before i knew it , the pie flew across the table . '' .	Ended up in my lap .	and
4	43758	Me the necklace to put on her .	She hops up into bed and hands .	when
0	80866	She was his , she thought with a grin .	There was nothing he could do about it .	and
2	95835	Spalko could have delegated the orientation to any one of a number of assistants .	He prided himself on person-ally making sure all his new employees were settled .	but
0	116118	Constant time continued her stately march toward an end that none could know , and .	The cycles of labor and rest among the gods continued even as mother sea and father earth watched but said nothing .	and
0	105475	Naitty suddenly , please find a post box .	Send it for me .	and
3	115036	Why the girl would ask .	His people were covered in zits .	if
0	119161	He shakily handed the passport to his uniformed arbiter .	Waited for the crushing weight of the discriminating hand of united states law to be placed upon his shoulder .	and
0	68786	I had never been to the ranch .	Had no idea what it even looked like .	and
0	126377	She leaned in close .	Whispered , i think she heard something .	and
4	69949	And damned if he would remember just how good she felt .	Her body was pressed against his during their dance .	when
3	10883	How did i get in amelia 's head .	She showed it to me .	if
2	116387	It was hours ago , and .	She 'd nursed it .	but
1	116121	Despite everything , he seemed to care about her situationperhaps .	He was partially to blame for it .	because
0	141569	Desperately he hit again again , but .	Each blow threw his arms .	and
0	47418	You trained me to fight . '' .	Then you kept me out of the real battle .	and
4	138369	And , i had to wonder if being with me like that was as special and different for him as being with him was for me .	We got to the apartment and he proceeded to get us both very naked and very much into the best mood possible .	when
0	155742	Opening the door , he reached in .	Pulled out a water bottle that had been stripped of its label .	and
2	12408	He tried to buy every dvd of montana they already sold them .	Daddy total snapped , disowned montana , he said he isnt going to talk to her till she would change her life , and .	but
4	12007	To be called the princess of an entire realm .	She doesnt even understand her kingdom .	when
0	155688	Samlinel took his staff .	Projected some type or arcane shield in front of the fireballs just in time to protect alexander .	and
0	82945	Now gorlas wished he 'd contacted keita , but he thought her aunt simply had desires that needed to be filled .	Told her what he knew .	and
2	87721	Somehow not saying the word meant something to me .	Lola pressed me to say it .	but
4	148567	To land in the water .	The wooden railing gave way .	when
0	124476	They 'd had enough .	It seemed thousands of others shared their sentiments .	and
4	39818	Her pupils were dilated beyond anything he 'd seen .	Mariketa gazed up at him .	when
0	132463	Echo took the edge of his sleeve , then ripped the sleeve off .	Tore it all the way up to his shoulder .	and
0	88123	He gave a small nod .	She thought she had satisfied him .	and
2	67533	Her character traits included meekness and friendliness .	She had no backbone .	but
2	74061	I wanted to say something witty .	My mind had gone blank , and my tongue stayed glued to the roof of my mouth .	but
2	96733	Been up against some pretty nasty wildfires .	I 've never been in a situation like this before .	but
2	108041	Here i was , and .	She was eager to talk .	but
0	94260	The cat took advantage of the newfound space .	Curled up into a ball where seamus 's foot had been .	and
0	147153	We just skip the war this time .	Go directly to the peace-conference .	and
2	74401	For his part , ryan kept himself contained as was his nature ; the hedge was allowed to grow until it all but obscured the house from his sight .	He moved back into the apartment and ordered the house closed with no one to go .	but
2	10740	'' nolan began , trying for patience .	He was just as uneasy about the prospect of talking about the past as his twin .	but
0	61084	They found his skin in an alley .	He wound up stuffed and mounted in the dime museum .	and
1	146505	He 'd learned a little about pleasing a woman .	He did a mighty fine job .	because
0	108512	Just dylan came out of the clinic .	Made for the truck .	and
3	5153	And ... , i might as well tell you , right ? '' .	I 'm going to lose him over you .	if
2	25939	Wished i could take some headache pills and lie .	I went to the basement level of the house .	but
0	44607	It was my sister 's night .	The bedroom door was closed .	and
0	80727	He put his arms underneath me .	Scooped me off the ground .	and
0	81364	So he 'd gone back to the queen 's guards .	Because i refused him , she 'd declared him celibate .	and
0	125545	He reached within his pocket .	Gave his friend mephistopheles a rub for good measure .	and
2	14396	There were many men who have come .	None had a tale such as that .	but
2	96312	I had to wear the jeans tonight while i had the chance , and .	The marker would probably take years to wash out .	but
4	123199	Dragging ethan into this fight .	Rachel is still fragile .	when
0	23759	A booming sound was heard from outside the building .	The lighting suddenly went dark .	and
3	134290	Was nipping my shoulder while he napped .	I tried to move .	if
0	39449	He reset the bag with the orizas in it more firmly on his shoulder .	Got out with oy at his heel .	and
2	155959	I 'd stand up to shake your hand . '' .	I seem to be having trouble getting up from this contraption .	but
3	62279	`` little gal , '' clay said , `` , it just might be best if we let the place go to the kudzu .	You and me are going to settle in this town .	if
2	104633	This does not in itself contribute dramatically to a conviction .	The ones on the right are from jacksons file of five and a half years ago , the ones on the left are from the car .	but
2	2241	It was he had something .	Then he lost it .	but
4	106336	You can usually find her with her kids , or escaping in a good book .	She 's not writing .	when
0	126253	Now the doorbell would ring .	When he answered it his past would be there waiting for him .	and
4	82381	Both of us nearly fall , his father and a baby-bumped cassie .	We spot his mother .	when
3	136050	She watched the aal kussaimi tribe elder climb up onto the platform .	It had been for show or if it could possibly be true .	if
2	145987	Some people are just better at discerning what other peoples lives need , rather than .	What their own life requires .	but
0	146201	Then moth strained his fists .	Both immediately rushed toward each other and locked blades .	and
0	92222	Godwin had come under his roof , to study hebrew , to talk philosophy , to sit at my father 's feet .	Yet he had done this dastardly thing of seducing the great teacher 's daughter .	and
0	98665	They all went out onto the deck of the victory .	Trenicia immediately saw the large fire on the beach .	and
0	146056	Then he held up his hands .	Made a small gesture .	and
2	132618	Moni begins to cry out .	He guesses her intent , bringing his fist down hard onto her face .	but
2	135456	If a boulder was thrown at her , and she caught it , the thrower was benched .	There was no such thing as an illegal shot .	but
3	87174	He was going to wind up in tighter restraints than the ones they 'd had avery wearing .	This assignment went on much longer .	if
0	149173	When they had disappeared from sight , thousands more were released .	They too disappeared over the horizon .	and
0	14794	Maria ... '' ellison slid his arms around her .	Leaned down for a brief kiss .	and
2	77908	It 's his last one day before the end of his shore leave , and .	He turns up , nervous , his boots shining like mirrors and his hair slicked .	but
0	6282	Take this damned bracelet off me . '' .	Tell me where the hell is he .	and
2	76662	The artist in me craved much more of the world was the only world he wanted .	He had seen too much of it in vietnam and the farm .	but
4	132502	Finally she turned off the water and backed away from the sink , trying not to slip in the bloody mess at her feet .	The heat was too much to stand .	when
0	62422	Gently he put it down .	Slowly the plant unfurled its leaves from around his fingers .	and
2	8804	Ians eyes lit up as she talked .	She was on the hunt .	but
2	149577	She finally saw what had caught his attention .	She had to get down on her hands and knees to do it - how sharp his eyes were .	but
0	57809	They 'd be coming .	They 'd be leashing any women they found .	and
4	136169	He was going to school to be a dentist and she was president of the ladies ' auxiliary .	My dad married my mom .	when
0	90142	It resembled a thinly-fleshed skull , while her dainty , lilac-scented skin had turned an unhealthy shade of yellow .	Was stretched here and there by protruding bones .	and
2	108056	The site was on the cheesy side .	A reliable company was a reliable company , cutesy bells and whistles notwithstanding .	but
2	155780	Jemmy had been present .	Scarcely counted , as he had slept through the service .	but
1	28622	Shed chosen this particular table .	She could see anyone coming in or leaving , and also she could cover the whole bar area in case of danger .	because
3	123575	You 'll be fine . '' .	You stay away from that .	if
2	57455	I showed up for induction when i was supposed to .	The draft centers records showed that i was deceased .	but
3	85899	She might not have .	She 'd been given something as inedible as that burger , but not only had he paid for the meal .	if
4	50827	Elizabeth stood and turned the lights .	Outside her window she saw someone riding their bike with a white bag in one arm .	when
2	111850	Now that things were returning to normal , and .	The adrenaline was fading , the reality of that commitment was sinking in .	but
0	86414	It hits the edge of the chasm caused by the rocket .	Dives right into the tremendous hole .	and
4	80693	After looking at the dates on the coins - none of which were more recent than 1684 - , she was just picking the telescope up and trying to focus it and look out through the window back towards the beach and the sound of loud , excited voices .	She heard the lock in the door behind her rattling .	when
0	27252	She took another bite .	Washed it down with some wine .	and
2	75827	You 're probably right . '' .	It 's what i 'm doing .	but
0	15148	We came to ourselves to find no sign of your friend .	You lying senseless and aglow .	and
0	131515	You are delusional or have some screws .	Do not have any clear direction .	and
2	149751	He took a careful step towards jenkins , flinching at the pain .	Forced himself to take another .	but
2	64790	Then the sounds coalesced and .	He caught the tune .	but
0	6108	Ander and silos rushed to their uncle .	Guarded him on each side as he cut his way through the goblins .	and
2	59645	He wouldnt speak to houston and .	He just kept carefully pruning , with his eyes on his work .	but
0	116708	There , she 'd been brave .	Said exactly what she wanted .	and
2	22708	I hit the road with enough force to see stars .	The scrape of approaching claws got me moving .	but
0	111106	The king smiled at her .	She tried not to flinch as she drank .	and
2	15109	The uninjured man should bear the heavier load , and ramon recognized the impulse clearly enough to know there was no point arguing .	His twin was bent on putting the soft-handed amadora banker in his place .	but
2	62849	Somehow she convinced her old boss that not only would it bring lots of business into seaside taffy .	Having a legit rock star singing on the street would be almost like a tourist attraction .	but
2	113836	Most tourists mistranslated jardins des tuileries as relating to the thousands of tulips that bloomed .	Tuileries was actually a literal reference to something far less romantic .	but
2	129575	Liam began to sit up .	Ty put a foot on his shoulder and shoved him back to the floor .	but
0	57343	That rose at the head of the shallow riverbed .	Overlooked padan 's breastworks and the gentle slope currently occupied by the atazak invaders .	and
0	69109	She opened her eyes with what seemed like extraordinary effort .	Focused on the water-bowl to the left .	and
0	9125	I bring you the girl matthias repeated .	You release me from the brotherhood .	and
4	72881	Grabbing one of the folded chairs , i start to haul it out the door .	I feel something on my arm .	when
0	21812	Split up , one at a time .	Go try out them out .	and
0	13112	The fall to the floor shocked the monk exceedingly , whose thoughts had been .	He looked about himself as though for the first time .	and
2	129824	He closed his eyes .	Knew sleep would be a long time coming .	but
0	116199	She was tight , tighter than a fist .	He knew he stretched her .	and
0	610	Have all developed god complexes .	Consider themselves masters and protectors of this world .	and
3	155879	Why did they just leave you .	They went to the trouble to abduct you .	if
2	24944	For a moment , i thought he must be riding a dolphin .	No sea-brother ever bobbed around like that .	but
2	43078	She could feel his hand melting through her back , at times his breath on her skin .	He moved so silently , she would never have known he was there without her heightened senses .	but
0	26912	Basha and monika gazed at each other .	Groaned before they ran .	and
4	83332	It 's hard letting go of something .	You 've had it for .	when
0	149372	It happen and he smiled and got to work .	The cutter took the nod from behind scars shoulder .	and
3	74205	Wellyou know running a hand through his hair , duke said .	It is mr priceand we dont know anything for certain , spike his head shook .	if
0	41786	He could see her shaking .	He retrieved his shirt and folded it around her body .	and
3	87199	He leaves the apartment .	The hounds of hell are nipping at his heels .	if
