382,Not all exchanges accept every type of order,"even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer",6
383,And a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer,a specific order is acceptable to an exchange,0
384,and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers,it imposes no price restrictions,2
385,get me in now,get me out now,5
386,"With a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market","if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price",7
387,For example a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price,wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060,3
388,that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers,Profits realized from these trades would be shared by the conspiring brokers,10
389,Limit orders are used,investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment,3
390,Investors may regret the restriction,the stock reaches 54 and then falls,3
391,if the stock reaches 54,and falls,10
392,investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price,the market goes at least one tick ( the smallest price increment permitted ) beyond the limit price,5
393,"Unless the market goes at least one tick ( the smallest price increment permitted ) beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled",there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price,2
394,to buy or sell an investment,the price reaches a certain level,10
395,to buy or sell an investment,the price reaches a certain level,2
396,"a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get",the price reaches that level,10
397,"a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get",the price reaches that level,2
398,"Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order",the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get,6
399,"Once the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order",the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get,10
400,Stop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders,they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses,2
401,there is a difference,stop orders sound similar to limit orders,0
402,Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price,buy stops above,6
403,Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above,sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below,1
404,"In contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price",buy limit orders are placed below,6
405,that the order was filled at $ 75,the stock opened at that price on Monday,10
406,Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders,an investment trades at the price specified in the order,3
407,which are filled at the market price,the stop price is hit,10
408,which are filled at the market price,the stop price is hit,3
409,it does n't get filled,it ca n't be made at that price,3
410,"Investors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled","if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price",0
411,But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order,the market moves quickly enough,3
412,But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order,the investment has passed the specified price,2
413,in that they become market orders,a specified price is reached,3
414,Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached,"unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price",1
415,"However , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price",a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it,1
416,the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price,the market trades at the specified price,10
417,It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better,"if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled",1
418,But the order is automatically canceled,the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately,3
419,he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively,trading options,3
420,they do n't fill it immediately,I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price,3
421,to take more time to buy or sell an investment,they think they can get a better price by waiting,3
422,to fill whichever order they can first,and cancel the other order,10
423,On the close '' can be added to many types of orders,"market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . `` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . `` Day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date",7
424,of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders,and forgetting about them,10
425,who change their mind about buying or selling,an order has been filled,10
426,"IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta","investors better not ignore its limitations , either",1
427,"The beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0","a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on",2
428,Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas.Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market,Remember that beta also has important limitations,1
429,Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret,that beta has important limitations,6
430,There is risk that is not associated with market moves,the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that,6
431,and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that,beta does n't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock,9
432,That `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks,it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio,1
433,"In particular , beta does n't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock",Beta is a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer,6
434,Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer,"the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired",9
435,"In particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down",the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired,1
436,but the stocks tend to have low betas,their moves are not market-inspired,2
437,In reality it 's very volatile,the movements are not because of market movements,0
438,what 's the specific peril that comes to mind,you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment,11
439,what 's the specific peril that comes to mind,you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment,2
440,you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding,you 're like most people,3
441,People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension,therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others,1
442,Risk wears many disguises,"investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds",6

449,they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns,financial professionals measure risk mathematically,11
450,"When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns",Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider,7
451,"Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills , for example",the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider,2
452,"When financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns",investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals,1
453,But investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals,some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash,7
454,"For instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings","the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods",1

458,"They estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year.They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals",they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified,8
459,that investors need to consider,the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk.But they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk . The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue,7
460,"For instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk",they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk,1
461,The younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio,the bulk of the money is in a single issue,2
462,"Note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman",one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility,1
463,Take the expected return,add one standard deviation to it,6
464,Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it,take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation,10
465,Then take the expected return,subtract one standard deviation,6
466,"In two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range",all the assumptions were accurate,3
467,Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation,add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range,10
468,"Of course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals",the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans,9
469,"Indeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense",the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans,3
470,They may feel emotionally secure now,they are not heavily in the stock market,2
471,They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market,they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future,1
472,trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded,it comes to investing,4
473,Looking to the past can provide some clues,Over several decades investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills,7
474,Looking to the past can provide some clues,while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself,1
475,But there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself,history can suggest what is reasonable to expect,0
476,But there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself,bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market.And returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past,7
477,"For instance , some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market",returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past,6

1974,"If they put a Republican into office , not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits",their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from `` bringing home the bacon '' to their respective constituencies,6
1975,"Each legislator , after all , is only one out of 535",it comes to national policy making,4
1976,such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits,a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state,1
1977,Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular district/state,such a president is likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits,6

1981,they were more vulnerable to defeat,these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role in national policy making,2
1982,"First , why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century Second , it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives Third , the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office Fourth , the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office Fifth , the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South",the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House,6
1983,Since local benefit-seeking matters more,national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress,6
1984,this is precisely the pattern one would expect,Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts,3
1985,Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking,the key assumption is valid,3
1986,that such votes reflect national policy making,that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking,6
1987,Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking,"This is what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House",6
1988,"First , economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking , this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns . Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.This is indeed what the data indicate , particularly in the case of the House","as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices",6
1989,where local benefit-seeking duties matter more,national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices,6
1990,"Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices","An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 ( when control of that body changed party hands ) reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise , due to their majority-party status , over other resources such as committee staff",6
1991,"Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate",the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe,3
1992,"Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate",the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe,11
1993,"Put more simply , GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe",ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level,6
1994,State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse,"that , holding other factors constant , the difference between a state 's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate",6
1995,"First that GOP senators turn back roughly 10 % more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do . Second , if the key assumption is valid , Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking . Finally , as shown in the table , Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices An additional piece of evidence from the Senate : Holding other factors constant , such as incumbency advantages and regional factors , the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state ( a progressive tax rate hits higher-income states harder Moreover , ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level",at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation,9

2054,"Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90 % of their usual capacity , but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled , leaving the previously full hotel with an 80 % vacancy rate.City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings , but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled.Among the city 's banks , Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open.The closed branches , in San Francisco , Hayward , Santa Clara and Santa Cruz , sustained structural damage.Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line.Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America 's Concord office , and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles , the bank said . Wells Fargo & Co. said its Emergency Operations Committee -- which met all night Tuesday -- moved its global-funds transfer system to El Monte , Calif. , 500 miles to the south.Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed , while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order . The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter , 80 miles south of San Francisco.Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $ 600 million.Santa Clara County has a running total so far of $ 504 million , excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos . Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday ; a section of I-880 , a twotiered highway , collapsed in Oakland , causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake . San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total $ 2 billion.That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished , peeled business facades south of Market Street , and houses in the city 's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations.Many streets and sidewalks buckled , and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured . The federal funds would go to a range of programs , including the Federal Emergency Management Agency , highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration , according to Rep. Vic Fazio ( D. , Calif. ) . FEMA , which coordinates federal disaster relief , is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo , which hit the Carolinas last month.It is likely to get as much as $ 800 million initially in additional funds , and eventually could get more than $ 1 billion , according to Mr. Fazio , a member of the House Appropriations Committee . White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements.The Bush administration has at its disposal $ 273 million in funds remaining from the $ 1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo . `` We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate , short-term requirements , '' Mr. Fitzwater said.He added that the Office of Management and Budget , the Transportation Department and other agencies are `` developing longer-term legislation '' that should be ready soon . Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges.California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state . Some things ca n't be repaired.The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $ 10 million to $ 15 million in damage , including shattered porcelains and stone figures.Its neighbor , the De Young Museum , totaled $ 3 million to $ 5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture . The city 's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls , and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor . The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city 's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake , wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers.At San Francisco International Airport , shock waves wrecked the control tower , knocking down computers and shattering glass.Offices of the city 's Rent Board were destroyed . Mayor Agnos 's $ 2 billion estimate does n't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city , some of which remained closed.A major chunk of the $ 2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency , said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos . `` All of the city 's $ 5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours '' on overtime salaries , he said . Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices . At Fireman 's Fund Corp. , a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake , and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area . `` Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant , '' a spokesman said . `` We 're delivering a check for $ 750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday . '' Fireman 's is part of a $ 38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge , which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income . California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $ 100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster , as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads . In addition , under the highway-relief program , the federal government provides 100 % of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort.After that , the federal share diminishes.For interstate highways , the federal share normally would drop to 90 % of the cost of repairs , and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost.But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100 % federal funding for several months . Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands , according to an aide to Rep. Fazio",the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number ( 800-462-9029 ) to expedite service to victims of the earthquake,6

Few telephone lines snapped.That 's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points.The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake","phone service was sporadic ; many computer terminals remained dark , and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power",0
