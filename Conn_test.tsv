3	112925	Then she needs to know about men .	Were supposed to give her advice on being a woman .	if
1	152312	The cuff was moving .	The skin it rested on was moving , sliding the way a heavy object on a rug will slide if someone pulls the rug .	because
2	118334	In this case he wasnt even sure when he would have the opportunity to transmit them .	He owed it to his crew to at least try so they all had to be ready before the tren arrived .	but
4	137322	It magical hangs in the air .	I wiggle my hand .	when
0	75459	Jason sighed in relief .	We all gathered around the bottom of the tree .	and
0	93595	He reached under the dashboard tugged on it .	Found the black plastic handle that opened the trunk .	and
0	32586	Her eyes narrowing at jake .	Remembering the denials she heard in timberlane .	and
0	141202	The sound is warm light and .	I want to bottle it .	and
0	151280	The black dots were .	I had a feeling we were about to get reacquainted with the loving embrace of onyx .	and
2	46833	I want to invite her to come with me .	It 's too risky .	but
1	21835	You heard about golems flooding out houses .	No one told them to stop carrying water from the well , or washing the dishes until the plates were thin as paper .	because
0	44187	`` stupid , foolish witch , '' he said , wiping his mouth .	Then licking the blood from his hand .	and
2	151520	We may be just learning this shit .	We dont take well to being treated like children .	but
0	15156	The truth struck him .	He wanted to vomit .	and
2	100557	Isopropylamine has nothing to do with the worm die-out .	The worms died of internal temperature irregularities , lack of moisture , and veritable lack of immune system response .	but
0	99546	Through years ago it was also 47-feet .	The bridge had sheared off the wind vane .	and
0	146118	Simply pick up an object .	Know what a person was thinking and feeling .	and
2	107819	`` my wife has better sense , '' he said .	Was conscious all the same of a sinking sensation at the mention of claire .	but
2	6186	I think thats it .	She starts again , singing and dancing with even more gusto .	but
3	38199	Then maybe he would have seen the signs earlier .	Only he 'd spent more time with his grandmother and less time with whatever woman he 'd been screwing .	if
2	116172	... '' i try to add up the years .	Our history is too muddled by lies and phydus to know exactly how long that 's been .	but
0	100083	The stream ran down the hill on the left .	Vanished into the white shadows .	and
0	12762	Grabbing the hilt in one swift motion drew it out of the scabbard .	Making a grandiose motion , tretchbolt flexed his impressive muscles , pinwheeled his sword arm .	and
4	75726	Taking her small hand in his , he again thought , i will win .	Malkom followed the witch .	when
4	59308	A lead weight sinks in my stomach .	I realize i must confront her when she gets .	when
0	94119	I 'll win the challenges .	Get to own you '' .	and
3	150188	They hung onto it , for inspection and potential evidence .	It came to that .	if
2	147095	I opened my mouth to respond .	Trevor stopped me cold .	but
0	3788	With soft white fur and cheerful polka dot spots , otter came over to artie .	Nuzzled his new muzzle against the old man 's face .	and
0	37163	They expelled whatever was base and putrid from their life-forces .	In a flash , became our rather primitive , but still ethereal ancestorssources of light peopling the heavens .	and
1	33074	Which created an instant motel-room shortage .	The trail stop inhabitants were already here and needed places to stay .	because
0	142972	He pulled the knife away from my face .	Gave it an appraising look .	and
2	70060	You know how to shoot , you see the list goes on .	Do not have a gun .	but
4	107687	She walked past the reception area , and kept on looking straight ahead , her eyes refusing to look at anyone .	She entered the building .	when
0	14348	He can return home .	Say he is satisfied .	and
2	102588	Not to pause for sleep or food .	Only to change horses in order to get to rouen as quickly as possible .	but
2	5247	We searched everywhere . '' .	Your scent just dried up out .	but
0	125460	He then walked over to me .	Gave me my keys .	and
3	50459	I 'll take you down and buy you a drink .	You 'll come along and change my dressings .	if
3	87077	And , you all would have died that night . '' .	It had been left up to me .	if
2	88557	She was an expert at the common social pleasantries .	Tonight had been so different from the interactions she was accustomed to .	but
4	21917	A job , the second suspect in the case was just blown to bits .	He tried to prevent the fbi from arresting him .	when
4	156814	He cloaked every part of himself in flames and slowly walked up the steps .	Ethan made up his mind .	when
3	27946	Then just humor me , okay ? '' .	You are an atheist like ricky .	if
2	104782	`` like you , aleksei , i learned long ago how to fool those idiot machines .	Even if that were not so , in this case i would willingly submit it , for it 's true .	but
4	126592	Who come out of the woodwork .	You run a conspiracy theory blog .	when
0	140991	Perhaps elvis could play it .	Make out is was all just an exciting adventure .	and
2	141238	Sebastian had kept his coat on while he ate .	Was finally warm enough to take it off .	but
1	113563	I cant take you home .	I cant leave the store to .	because
4	77383	People so often employ in totalitarian regimes .	They wish to avoid repercussions .	when
4	94718	To return to his studies .	The universities were quieter and he had saved some money .	when
0	94095	The man lifted his glass .	Drained the last of it .	and
0	132580	He rolled off the side of his horse onto the ground .	Another dark form approached pelas , but .	and
3	128859	She 'd better be in his bed .	She had to be .	if
2	69106	So sharing a sandwich with the rest of the work crew they walked off following along the edge of the billabong .	Staying in the shade of thick paperbark trees a few metres back from the edge .	but
0	81278	Siphoning it to him .	Stoking anew the tempest within .	and
2	144382	She recognized his voice .	Still asked if it was him , some redundancy of habit she 'd picked up in acting school .	but
3	70680	Sarah would be the fluffy white pampered city type that would likely run at the first sign of a rodent .	The two were cats .	if
3	69290	Surely the japanese would be talking japanese .	Even he was multi-lingual .	if
0	57415	He pulled it from its scabbard .	Ran his left thumb along the edge of the blade .	and
3	47980	We can get more guns-after all , they are but dumb iron brutes and there are many forges that make them , but the ship and its crew are much more difficult to replace .	We can fly faster and get to safety .	if
2	59214	Whatever it might be .	When it came , it was a total , shocking surprise .	but
2	64162	I was pretty sure that wasnt a compliment .	I did accept his words as approval .	but
1	111098	You came looking for a warrior .	Youd managed to get dangerous men after you .	because
2	24360	For every question there will be an answer .	There is no desire to learn there will be no desire to teach .	but
2	77992	She had been betrothed .	Had run away to the docks where once noticed by henry avery .	but
4	14404	Who knows ? '' .	We 'll get another chance to sleep .	when
3	70632	We may be able to do this . '' .	You will visit with hari seldon .	if
2	106526	Obviously hed been there longer than they thought , and .	She was in foal to him .	but
1	83209	Mary signed up for it ; any science elective .	She needed a science elective .	because
2	9221	She 'd not done it once or twice countless times .	So she could count his eyelashes and .	but
3	106250	You are an acting agent of the law .	You keep letting your hands stay tied then it is the people of redemption who suffer .	if
2	91690	She checked for weapons .	Everyone had frozen in place .	but
4	74634	Maybe she too had a few tiny little guilt feelings .	Cinderella had ridden away with the prince on his white horse .	when
3	122841	Besides then there was little sense in making two camps .	They were going to travel in the same direction .	if
0	120242	I accidentally released a catch .	The multi-chamber cylinder swung out .	and
4	62540	She did not blink .	She saw chad at the door .	when
2	13771	Doan said with pride .	Hes a real eku .	but
2	99379	He wanted to say something in his defense .	That might only make him seem more guilty .	but
0	6705	They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of rivendell .	They came at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather .	and
2	25631	I shut myself in the bathroom .	Left the door unlocked in case cole needed in here for something and submersed myself under scalding-hot water .	but
2	158780	The captain had considered special ordering a seat for him .	It was the sort of thing that was rather easy to move to the bottom of the shopping list when the budget got tight , as it always did .	but
4	149258	The sun was setting .	Sally at last stirred , looking adorable with her gorgeous hair tumbled around her flushed face and her eyes velvet dark with lingering sleep .	when
2	116701	Eventually she asked , `` .	How did you find me .	but
0	110206	Exhaled heavily , looking into the dark for the silver tracing of pixy dust .	Turned in a slow circle .	and
2	149035	You owe me , and . '' .	That might mean lunch .	but
2	64033	She had promised , and .	Alex was eager to go .	but
2	61239	He had hoped she would die .	He 'd had no such good fortune .	but
0	26181	He grabbed her wrist .	For a second , she thought he was going to grab a lot more .	and
3	139214	I 'll buy you out of the publishing contract . '' .	You 'll withdraw the book .	if
2	57264	I mean work is fine and ariel recognized a cue when she heard one .	Our health is good and teddie has settled into her senior year in high school .	but
2	4208	Just a single wild rose growing in a vacant lot where a bunch of condos were scheduled to go up at some point .	Jake had an idea that there was nothing quite like it growing anywhere else on earth .	but
2	77394	The only emotion my father and i shared for each other was mutual loathing .	Don had found his way into my heart even before i knew i was related to him .	but
4	18253	I told him that .	I got to the part about st. louis .	when
4	31230	Last night , you were so tired .	You looked like you were about to fall off your feet .	when
3	27253	I 'd worked in these forests for fifteen years now and .	Anything , made me nervous .	if
3	118513	She 'd see where he was coming from .	She only knew how stinking adorable she was .	if
2	57293	There was one other , at least , besides misha .	Who knew how many talon had gotten around to releasing .	but
2	159568	It was exactly how i would have liked it with my wife she was a changed person .	Lisa and i made love without inhibitions and .	but
4	130680	Next , you see him again , and he asks you to lunch .	You pick up your jacket .	when
4	37993	He thought she 'd break his jaw .	He offered to pay .	when
4	126267	Why did they throw their lives .	They knew they couldnt win .	when
0	139442	He was in the same room .	After this many hours it was watching two whirlwinds face off against each other .	and
0	67668	Jace shook himself then hastily changed his clothes and wolfed down the food , both from hunger and eager to begin his education .	Frowned in consternation at the servants retreating .	and
0	12894	Loosing their way in the abandoned mines out in the desert .	Perishing before they could find their way out .	and
4	28724	To start nibbling at them .	Taylor opened his eyes .	when
2	123168	Still bent into the car , she punched numbers with her thumb .	The phone made the beeping noise that indicated it was out of range .	but
2	129717	It was nearly a bust .	Finally he was able to flip over onto his belly and staggered as he struggled to his feet .	but
2	111949	Im like a stripperyou can look .	You can not touch .	but
4	43405	Had been tonsured and had now already lived for many years in monastic service .	She was only eighteen .	when
0	26355	The smart ones just came in to browse .	They covered their true goal by opening a car magazine first , then putting the other one inside .	and
2	147250	Look , i dont know what this is .	Were not here to fight you .	but
3	63101	I would have found a way to make you say yes . '' .	You had said no .	if
4	91946	Never knew his dad , mom died .	He was ten , bounced around from foster home to foster home until he aged out of the system at eighteen .	when
0	66885	Malvern 's gaze shifts swiftly to me .	Then holly , an eyebrow raised .	and
1	121140	I had to have you neutered .	You insisted on being unpleasant .	because
4	76302	She took on a resigned look and said , as you said , my lord , i should be with my king .	He slumped deeper into his seat .	when
2	52402	Most times he would 've handed off the task to his executive secretary .	Since penny had gone off and married his older brother dillon , he and nolan had not yet filled her former position so the task was left in his hands .	but
4	151185	She really did light up the cathedral .	She walked down the aisle .	when
0	46155	Besides , they will never expect it .	I doubt even their advanced instruments can successfully navigate them through the graveyard .	and
0	28641	The spasm of anger passed .	His eyes gushed tears .	and
2	50391	I thought she was going to tell me to leave .	She pulled me into a hug .	but
0	49147	It was intoxicating , brightening the shadows in my own mind and dissolving the weight that was always trying to crush me .	I drank it in as it warmed me from my head .	and
0	121750	Ive never been one to run from a fight , kosai started to say .	Then stopped and dragged his fingers in the sand .	and
1	108179	Though she looked put together as always with a jeweled tunic and white capri pants , her gaudy bracelets jangled on her wrists .	She kept nervously flapping them by her side .	because
2	128690	You 'd think the houses of light were forming a constellation of truth .	You 're not looking at them from .	but
2	131934	Tania must be insane to do something like that .	If she is as smart as everyone say , then she will learn everything she needs .	but
0	22045	In three days we shall be delivered from this creature . ' .	Where i shall send his he can harm nobody .	and
0	141981	I am standing behind a man in a dull blue jacket and a hat .	His back is so high he blocks my view of everything .	and
2	40110	I tried to pull her out .	She was too heavy .	but
4	134231	You waking me up .	You get back from the club .	when
3	118506	This was the one she 'd get - and yes , he 'd bolted it to the floor .	She had to have a safe .	if
1	39497	She must have woke up ty 's mom .	She reached her arms out and called for her .	because
0	122332	He wanted to up the stakes .	Shove it right under their noses now that he knew he could .	and
4	39677	`` ten , '' i said .	She got out of her red convertible .	when
3	77780	I thought , remembering once more laoghaire and the conversation with colum .	He meant to do any such thing .	if
2	27469	He was falling in love with a person he could not see .	At times he would swear that he could hear her voice as he read her messages .	but
0	72602	I signaled the others behind me .	Made a hasty run towards the small tunnel .	and
0	2229	I returned to the living room .	Approached the panel of glass .	and
2	67858	His brows were raised into a questioning expression .	His face was kind , not angry or accusing .	but
4	115162	Then i decided against it ; thats exactly where she wants to be , in the center of his attention .	I saw jt in the seat next to her .	when
2	120963	Afraid most of the other nuns are too mild to not take offense at a guest hurrying to leave .	You are a lord and i suppose you have important business to attend .	but
0	94892	Eat his meals ride around on a big horse shouting orders at people .	To do all day but .	and
2	145377	The taste was so bad i started to gag . '' .	He told me if i vomited , he would leave the tape on so i choked to death on my own puke .	but
4	147966	An odd bag draped across his arm .	Hale noticed a hotel employee standing beneath the security camera that was trained on the dance floor .	when
4	27838	Katryn started to speak .	The salads were served .	when
3	122276	All over her hand .	She used her left .	if
0	14842	Some mysterious entity had answered her .	Made her heart like ash .	and
4	30683	The answer to these questions came clear .	I saw him walk through the gate and into my courtyard .	when
0	159751	To protect my honor and name , he has allowed all of you to insult and attack him .	I will not stand for him to be hurt .	and
2	120224	It was sealed shut .	Its electronic lock was shut off , not displaying the red dot that typically suggested a locked door .	but
3	8807	Just what he would do .	He were given the opportunity to be with myriam .	if
0	154487	Tyruc filled out the search form .	Submitted it with additional details of kuan-aree and so on .	and
0	101576	I 'll make a little cut on my hand and on yours , make a promise , okay ? '' .	Then we press them .	and
2	100043	She tried to swallow .	Her tongue sat thickly in her mouth .	but
0	5967	Out of the corner of her eye she saw nate fling himself off the roof .	Plummet to the ground below .	and
4	79927	He would be happier still , displaying her majesty .	He got above celet 's dark depressing atmosphere to where the stars brightly shone with celet 's mother planet , celebrity .	when
0	7381	Darkfest reined his mount to a halt .	The mare drew up alongside .	and
0	37807	To make the trip enjoyable .	Enjoying it we were .	and
2	95575	You dont do this all the time .	When you do your forehand is inconsistent .	but
2	133432	He had taken her to the hospital .	The doctor shook his head and said there was nothing he could do .	but
4	53692	He just smiled and nodded .	All six of them thanked him at nearly the same time .	when
1	55851	To act like im helpless .	Just were inside the shields .	because
2	119457	He climbed the stairs and , and there he saw a wiry man about his own height and age sporting a little too much razor stubble to be making a fashion statement .	Followed her son into the kitchen .	but
0	69727	A few minutes later , he returned .	Dumped something into the trash can .	and
0	256	The damned goddess pissed him off .	Mocked everything he held sacred .	and
1	73104	I just wanted to hurt you . '' .	I thought it would make me feel better .	because
2	152156	Chatting in a corridor anything going from theatre to theatre .	Out of operating rooms at unusual times of the day at times when you would expect her to be ensconced in one theatre , or down in the tea room , or .	but
2	64809	That would still mean .	It wouldnt tell us anything more than what we already know .	but
3	63336	Our business relationship is over .	I see another one .	if
1	57125	This can take hours , hurry up and wait .	There is a protocol that must be followed to minimize loss of lifethe army adage .	because
0	115685	Without pausing , she pulled the heavy trapdoor toward her .	Let go of it .	and
4	90489	She swore she could smell him on her sheets .	She climbed into bed .	when
4	61950	We were all smoking at the bar .	Someone put on an old frankie valli song and we did a little dance which brought out hysterical laughter from the irish .	when
2	159974	We can hear noises , triah offered .	We cant understand anything they are saying .	but
2	43299	To sound like a wuss .	I really think it 's time we went home .	but
3	110014	Where its warm and buy me a drink , ill tell you about a lesson i learned about helping people .	Youll go inside this here bar .	if
2	94097	Any other queenslander , himself included , would be guaranteed a fight with those words .	Ike had apparently earned some respect due to his longevity .	but
2	70215	Her mouth continued to work on the other side of the glass .	Her words were muffled and unintelligible .	but
2	146770	He 's not here , and . '' .	You are , so i think you should totally take this class with me .	but
3	159151	`` , he 'll go down like any other man . '' .	We destroy his weak spot .	if
2	24804	He probably could have hidden that it ever happened .	He decided to be honest .	but
0	2791	He was a piece of paper .	Came right for me .	and
4	44294	The volume became muffled .	I walked through the door .	when
3	89366	Dejected , throat burning , and not knowing what else he could possibly do , not knowing .	What he had done had changed anything at all .	if
0	123855	When , it might be days or weeks .	It may be that he will never be quite the person he was .	and
4	77433	Jons trip down memory lane was cut .	He realized that pastor avery was looking at him as he addressed the congregation .	when
3	108393	It would have to be quick and concealed in the night , with movements of stealth and energy .	I were to act at all .	if
2	10876	Standing beside her was another woman about the same age .	Good god , she wore goth .	but
3	39475	Where the wild things are .	I thought i came back to earth .	if
0	134018	I glanced at my watch .	Saw it was eight-thirty .	and
2	9115	I know theres enough of us here that your number could be skewed .	You should be able to give a rough estimate .	but
0	36565	Bolt sniffed derisively stalked .	Turned on his heal .	and
0	26816	How simple it had been chaiko to return to the clan .	What joy it had occasioned .	and
1	159446	You do not want what seth wants .	There is no you in any of that .	because
2	105615	I thought that it was a bit morbid .	Jo-jo had gotten catalogs of various markers and had made me go through them with her while she did my nails in the salon one evening .	but
1	75983	They 're better than everyone .	Just they could bottle up their natural impulses for a little while .	because
1	43321	And , i could say this with absolute knowledge .	I had already died once and come close to dying several other times .	because
0	114378	Who were eventually brought to justice .	Slain like the dogs they were .	and
4	100351	Do you remember on graduation day .	Matthew said that he would be there for us if we ever needed him .	when
0	31660	That would have been eavesdropping .	Burnett has warned me , several times , that it would be wrong for me to use my invisibility powers for that .	and
2	40983	She kept hold of me with one arm turned us toward her daughters .	Her smile came back and .	but
2	119743	The dance was scheduled to end at 11 pm .	By ten the gym was almost empty .	but
3	58228	We lose so much more than i can even fathom .	We f**k this up .	if
0	21132	You are a bit hyper out of control .	You have this creative surge but , at least that is how others see you sometimes & yea , i guess .	and
1	78393	Apparently , when he meant i could talk to him about anything , he meant anything but a raise .	His kind expression promptly turns unfriendly .	because
3	106130	He might as well make it worth her while .	She was going to damn him for his money .	if
4	22246	She was really the one in charge of all of this .	Tammy thought about it .	when
0	16213	******* chapter 2 the ballad of govind amar pura is one of the oldest neighborhoods in ludhiana , endearingly known amidst the residents of the city as ganda naalah .	Is situated on the southern bank of a black and putrid sewage stream .	and
0	12603	I devastate the land .	Shatter it to dust .	and
2	64545	She remembered , and somewhere in there she fell asleep in sleep she still walked the paths of the graveyard .	In her mind she imagined and .	but
2	90536	We 'd made it .	We 'd lost red .	but
1	18128	Her thoughts must show .	He sighed and nodded .	because
4	25556	Where this deception would lead .	He first purchased the mask .	when
3	122967	They 'd probably second guess who she was based on the sole fact that katie never flew anywhere but on her daddy 's plane .	Someone did notice her .	if
3	100484	It was worth it .	Even it meant being stuck with the wolves for longer .	if
2	154532	She needed to rest .	There was no time .	but
2	101446	He had the bland face of an accountant .	There was something hard and withholding in his eyes that belied that surface assessment .	but
3	92370	But , yes , he 's mostly to blame . '' .	You demand that i speak .	if
3	88452	I 'll give you a cookie .	You can figure it out .	if
3	122690	Part of me wondered , nothing he did ever added up .	He even had a job .	if
2	113314	A musty scent hung in the air .	She was too tired to care .	but
4	104561	Why i was jumping the queue of dearly departed .	I was supposed to be waiting patiently for the next place in the afterlife to become available .	when
2	6928	I expelled a breath that briefly made me supplant my own predicament vanish .	Even if my life was entirely unburdened , i had no solution or legerdemain to make shawns crisis .	but
2	86768	The north wind was .	Its coldness was a summer breeze in comparison to what just happened .	but
3	82627	You 'd die , but it took some of the tiredness .	You tried to keep it up for more than a few nights .	if
2	11157	Some of it was the sirens .	More of it was alan ; what alan had done .	but
3	156875	You 'd better tell me where i can find your assassin friends . '' .	So you want me to forget that little incident at sea .	if
0	14789	It is valued for its healing properties . '' .	It can also be used to make fine clothing , if processed right .	and
0	5924	`` shit , '' the driver said .	She started scrabbling for something on the floorboards .	and
4	74682	Not to let out a scream .	My orgasm hit me .	when
0	72098	He raised his shield .	Grunted from the impact as the coins hit it and bounced away .	and
3	108461	She 'd rip the skin right off me ! '' .	I went n forgot that .	if
0	137328	Why not just declare them unclean .	Turn it into a crusade .	and
4	126480	She blurted out the first thing that came to mind .	He turned to kayla and looked at her with the unmistakable intention to reenact the make-out session from a few moments .	when
3	144625	His father would not be alive .	Garret had inherited the title .	if
0	24668	A few deeply shocked people wandered .	Forth , eyes dazed and mouths agape , like zombies in a horror movie .	and
4	138107	And , i know .	It came right down to it .	when
0	39816	We bypassed the classes .	Went directly to the equipment , where we spent forty-five minutes sweating .	and
2	103741	To push on the gas .	Then i quickly turn around when i think i could run out .	but
0	11959	To go to the library .	Get another batch of books .	and
2	107186	Id be arrested the day after .	I already pointed out ive gotten better .	but
0	134761	Richard had told her there was no need for birth control .	She 'd believed him .	and
0	129750	The sun cast golden beams directly on him making him look as though he 'd smuggled diamond flecks in his pores .	Paying tribute to his raw , masculine beauty .	and
0	36898	You tell her the deal with her bloodline . '' .	You let her make up her own mind when it comes to her future .	and
4	1984	She looks as good as she does .	She first wakes up .	when
2	27755	I scrambled to my feet .	Jules rolled to the door , kneeling between me and it .	but
0	102781	He heard an unearthly shriek of pain and surprise begin to issue from the doorkeeper 's dusty throat .	Then it was muffled , crammed .	and
1	82451	The more macho and homophobic the better . '' .	Every time you won the game you knew it was no one was as beautiful as you .	because
3	96808	They would just have to hope that brask and the others would come up with something .	The man they were going to see did not have the information they needed .	if
2	66767	Julie , unable to make out what the commotion was , nonetheless recognized they were not enemy soldiers .	When she climbed down from her horse , she was surprised to see auggey standing directly at the center of the crowd .	but
4	136315	Calling ... to less than six months ago the secret headquarters of the venators in rome .	He was discovered sneaking about in the consilium .	when
3	8460	Then i 'm taking you down with me . '' .	I 'm going to be persecuted solely on the basis of being a stepping-stone between witches and demons .	if
2	88550	She thought ahead and .	Considered that the overwhelming majority of earthlings had never seen one in the flesh .	but
2	23157	Karate guy went to the police station , the intention for them to bail .	Obstructed by the police , brutally deported him to leave .	but
2	138402	What dr. whitefield told you .	He is dead wrong she is a child .	but
0	77918	Finally curiosity got the better of him .	He pivoted on his heels .	and
4	125204	She gave a cry , cool water trickling behind her breastplate .	Another hit her chest .	when
2	94292	I sit on the ground for a while and my motor skills decide against it , and i resign to walking home with one functional shoe .	Try to repair the sandal .	but
4	81899	She might give everyone a peep show .	She uncrossed and recrossed her legs .	when
0	35395	The ilyn stood , head still bowed .	Grabbed the girl by the arm .	and
0	56546	`` imagine this , '' levecus began .	As he outlined the plan , ringolar smiled .	and
0	63664	The days growing colder .	Becoming dark earlier at night .	and
2	96659	'' he said , `` .	That 's my final offer .	but
2	135124	There would also be sorrow , and .	That too is part of life .	but
3	109080	She could really screw things up beyond all ability to conceive .	She made the wrong call .	if
2	148586	Being free of the stocks made jeremy and the mash that arrived for the evening meal was no more appetizing .	Edna a little more comfortable .	but
2	71975	The grav engines were roaring and i saw why theyd been in such a hurry to leave .	The nearflow was wailing so loud i dont think they heard me .	but
3	10502	Anyone 's going to put a stake through us .	That 's what 's bothering you .	if
2	145815	When the girl was found .	The out-of-town media was happily unaware of that bit of trivia .	but
4	157568	I said , `` i really am sorry about the new furniture you bought , nana . '' .	The credits finally rolled .	when
3	31416	How colette would react .	I just walked up to her in her town .	if
4	56783	It was the last straw .	A reporter from the english-language azerbaijan times had come all the way to stockholm to ask him the same questions .	when
0	13508	The older couple ate in a leisurely way .	Just slowly paid and took their leave , exchanging pleasantries with the waitress .	and
2	116122	They were known by their bright red sign showing a chubby character with a smile on his face not exactly a logo to encourage healthy eating .	It was indicative of the type of food on the menu .	but
2	102412	She could withstand some torture .	Considering what had been done to sam , she wondered how quickly she 'd break .	but
4	27072	I 'd almost wanted to scream yes .	Melody had asked if she could come .	when
0	109973	The vortex deepened , growing ever louder until it screeched with fury .	A strange whistling noise filled the air .	and
4	128664	You should have seen their faces .	She attacked callum and took him down .	when
2	21969	Connor went to run his hand through his dirty blond hair .	He couldnt push it in past his fingers .	but
4	116740	Thought about all the fun he was in for .	Robin gave birth the next year .	when
3	634	What would 've happened .	Shmug entered the room of distorting mirrors , or how the classes would go in the shwuggering shmug department in a university .	if
4	74393	I could barely hold my head .	I was so sick .	when
3	6843	Ill shoot you myself .	You dont shut up and go to sleep .	if
2	110141	That was the second time felix had heard about a policeman that evening .	He had to postpone any questions until .	but
2	133700	I should let him die , mavik thought .	Somehow he found himself charging at the scagazi .	but
3	31229	I see some hope in winning this battle .	We can act as a professional military force .	if
0	144524	Patrick released modot , but modot was not trying to aim the weapon at patrick .	Tried to force the pistol away from him .	and
2	140833	The people can not imagine why the gods would curse them in such a way .	Deep down , the queen can feel the heartless hands in the sky passing by without a second thought .	but
3	153831	I could flame the werewolves , tatijana offered .	There is a way to get all the lycans under shelter .	if
2	46603	She checked her cell phone .	There were no missed calls , no messages .	but
2	143038	They reminded rose of two mischievous boys about to play a game they both knew was off-limits .	They wanted to play .	but
3	66047	They 'll go mad .	They smell this thing .	if
0	91595	It stood from its cushions .	Pointed at me , strangely , with its little finger .	and
3	112645	To clean him out .	You 're really playing poker .	if
3	147374	It stops being neutral ground .	You make an interesting character .	if
1	65070	Their parents had to hush the conversation .	He was getting obnoxiously loud .	because
2	9419	He had discovered this .	It always surprised him .	but
0	23511	He has x-ray vision .	Can ascertain her health through the door .	and
1	64972	Mitchell was staring at her , the smoothest skin , and the most beautiful mouth of any woman he 'd ever known .	She had the greenest eyes .	because
3	146879	`` just see , '' .	The admiralty will pay for such a thing .	if
4	80634	Krit looked up at me .	I walked into the living room .	when
2	118361	And for a moment , for like a moment and a half , i thought he was flirting with me .	Then his hand squeezed kennas side and she giggled happily before swatting his chest .	but
0	150216	I shoved it into my pocket .	Wondered what i 'd dream about tonight .	and
2	85578	Your arm is broken .	I have begun repairs .	but
3	121080	I 'm sorry . '' .	I got a little carried .	if
2	48582	I should not be thinking that way with all the shit i was dealing with dominic .	I could not help it .	but
2	36769	Where i left my journal behind .	Kept the gun in hand while making my way to the collection beneath the willow tree .	but
2	80729	It was too shadowy to see his expression .	He pulled his girlfriend from her seat and onto his lap , wrapping his arms around her , cooing sweet nothings .	but
2	143357	The alchemists had given him the place .	There was no other stipend involved .	but
0	27544	Feeling happy with this application of logic , he stood to one side .	Gave an expansive wave .	and
0	147598	Wix emptied the clip .	Looked for more enemies .	and
4	114254	She put her foot .	He sat on the edge of her bed .	when
0	36254	Gasped again as angus whipped the lasso over vivianna 's head , freeing her .	Cassandra dropped her wand .	and
0	147774	Andrew dove into the back of the wagon , hoping against hope that he had not been seen .	Covered himself with the grey grass .	and
1	1844	Even i want to .	I 'm wearing gloves .	because
2	122744	`` that 's not what 's going on . '' .	We will find the real reason for her fainting spell .	but
0	79335	A hand touched her biceps .	She caught it , yanking .	and
0	126582	She was real young .	She told me she was a newlywed , said she got married at the rev 's chapel .	and
1	462	When gyth turned his head .	Just a fraction , and met niol 's stare , he saw very clearly what the cop was thinking .	because
3	53409	All he had to do was kiss me and i would be his .	He ever wanted me tamed .	if
2	52552	He tried to catch her hand as she got up and started for the house .	She sidestepped him at just the right moment .	but
2	47282	Senor roldan took most of her pay .	Without him she knew she 'd be with the rest of the hookers picking up drunks in triana .	but
4	53586	And that had made it worse last night .	Dominic had come back into the party just as she 'd run into them .	when
0	43145	They fell into their lineup .	Headed deeper into the jungle .	and
1	3172	Her inner fixer took over from her brain .	Clearly her grey matter was on vacation .	because
3	133722	He 'd hit me again when i woke , just for fainting in the first place .	I passed out after he hit me .	if
3	6889	You up for some more battling jordan chirped .	We find it well be going in today .	if
0	90738	Rusty meanwhile had fetched a tattered map of france from the coach dash .	He opened it up on the gravel , head bent in concentration .	and
4	155774	He stopped her tirade .	He placed his hand over hers .	when
2	60742	Reached out to pick up the strongbox .	A thought struck me .	but
4	81038	The scholar stayed motionless .	Even he got a hard and malicious kick .	when
0	107168	There were too many soldiers to fit onto the boat .	It took some jostling around before they accepted that they would certainly capsize before they got everyone out of the water .	and
0	142844	I turn around walk .	Then no more cracks about the bikini , or .	and
4	85367	To escape from the earth .	All saints day comes over us .	when
0	42869	I struggled to push him off , trapping them .	He shifted his weight so that his knees pressed into my legs .	and
2	51724	Breathed in through my nose .	Stopped when i smelled him .	but
2	98475	She is very protective of the house with me .	The house is her primary concern .	but
2	135820	Ryan 's gun held the monsters off for a bit .	Soon they learned how to dodge the hot , blue streams and leapt toward us , closing in .	but
0	23506	My sister would be concerned .	There would be people i barely knew disappointed not to have told me how very , very sorry they were for my loss .	and
2	1738	The workmanship was intricate .	He feared it was too worn to be a suitable gift .	but
3	147005	Why does he not give you money ? '' .	This grenville is so rich .	if
3	39706	Just for a moment , i 'd die .	His fingers could trail down my chest .	if
0	108354	All this will eventually become clear .	This is neither the time nor the place for that particular discussion .	and
2	144269	Her ever becoming another silver .	She was definitely growing into a mature , intelligent animal .	but
0	33372	Today he wore graphite gray slacks and a black dress shirt open at the throat .	Rolled up at the wrists .	and
4	153249	Lozan was regretting wearing his full robe .	He heard a snap and stopped in midstride holding his breath .	when
4	73869	You 'll ease your feelings by slamming me around .	The paralysis wears off .	when
3	153075	But , no question .	You get convicted for a murder charge that severe , youll be going away for life .	if
0	46928	I 've known jonah a long time .	He 's handling some of the paperwork regarding my new casino .	and
2	91872	It was crowded with smaller boats .	My crew finally manage to nudge its way in .	but
3	110391	We will do the same .	Mr. cooper chooses to press charges .	if
3	94538	It is . '' .	It affects the way you perform your job .	if
2	76627	The person she was now was a stranger inside her body , it wore her skin .	It was no longer her .	but
2	62367	Help me , i try to say .	The darkness swallows my feeble intent .	but
4	12341	I told roger as soon as i could .	I finally found out the truth .	when
2	9038	I sent another to ' the observer in london .	Omitted to say whom it was from , on the package .	but
2	140895	He 'd done nothing .	Avoid her all week .	but
1	41891	All he knew was he had to keep busy and if he didnt keep busy hed start thinking about her more and more .	He hadnt heard from gwen .	because
3	133761	Which , still provide pretty awesome access to the city .	You know where to look .	if
3	107569	This kind of trickery would be beyond him .	Even he had gone mad .	if
1	118462	The leader of maztars unit had been put on cleaning duty for three months .	Hed used the wrong setting during a training exercise with tu-7 .	because
0	93870	Still , at learning this nuance of it , my brows snapped .	I asked , `` why do the guys get all the cool animals .	and
0	30500	Boy , were they behind with current affairs ... `` my .	How are you feeling .	and
2	67873	Lucifer used all of his skill and all of the power he could muster as he hacked away at the gate keeper .	He could not push him .	but
2	145720	It was a sweetheart gown .	It embodied candice , giving her the look of a healthy woman with self-confidence , something many lack .	but
2	158291	Maybe he 'd done it out of pity , maybe he 'd done it to keep her from changing her mind about freeing him still he 'd done it .	He 'd even offered her a home and a job , and .	but
2	9487	At the moment , you are tuned into the life you are living .	There are billions and billions of other channels that exist in creation .	but
1	117615	My ship was targeted .	Nicole stumbled across a couple of cutthroats sabotaging it .	because
0	77295	It was amelia 's evening to cook .	Though i had to leave for merlotte 's in a few minutes , i enjoyed watching her leap into action , creating spaghetti sauce .	and
2	138897	Pushed against his chest ... ... lost in bliss all over again , i was dimly aware that he was cleaning me , learning me .	He held me close , savoring my mouth with his , coaxing with his tongue to make me forget myself .	but
4	49460	How enthused my heart got , like it 'd been waiting around silently for that one word to fall from her lips and jumpstart it to life .	The words just about left her lips .	when
3	146755	The cdc says that they will be small , isolated cases and can then be dealt with like a rabies outbreak .	There are any new outbreaks after this .	if
0	98314	Sometimes it 's just time you just got to embrace it .	It can be in all kinds of ways , but . '' .	and
0	62481	Serena has been coming to the great hall her entire life .	She has not once seen it so empty .	and
0	56774	His body was bruised from the beatings at the prison .	At times it was difficult to tell the bruises from the dirt .	and
4	43866	Her elbow hit his .	She put it in gear .	when
4	131531	Was working it into a pick for kaelahs hair .	He saw the healer going toward kaelahs hut .	when
2	108306	I hoped hed be all right on his trip .	I didnt have the guts to call him and tell him that .	but
2	141266	I know youre only an embryo .	Thank you for choosing me as your birth mother .	but
4	39411	When everything seemed upside down , as if you 'd look at a hole in the ground and see stars and constellations floating at the bottom , turn your head to the sky and see dirt and trees hanging suspended .	The weather seemed to have flipped completely off its usual course .	when
0	113136	They 'd been on the road for twenty minutes .	The lot of them had already engaged in a world war iii-scale conflict three times .	and
1	97349	She was mixed up now , in eating , then she only could eat very little during twenty years , because of the depression , and now she had appetite again , and doesnt really know how to eat .	She was on a diet since she was thirteen years old to she was twenty-one .	because
4	72296	Eureka noticed the floral suitcase , packed , at the foot of the stairs .	Diana placed a candlestick on the mantel .	when
4	104902	The land was already greyed over with the coming of night , and the air chilled them as they rode .	They rode back towards the city .	when
0	125150	Etana had died yesterday .	Aylward wouldnt survive much longer .	and
2	67376	Dardan knew of the count .	Had never met him .	but
2	90476	That used to be the main office of the factory .	Was now a makeshift security checkpoint designed to vet anyone who came in , to weed out the authorities and the troublemakers .	but
4	60811	To put the truck in reverse .	Someone knocked on my window .	when
4	57835	She stirs groggily , and the change in her is astounding .	Echos medical bed opens .	when
1	107357	Who might be tempted by this small thin body .	His girlfriend 's body was so different .	because
3	92521	Even after their last time together , then she 'd have to walk away before she became invested even more .	That was all he wanted from her .	if
4	126434	People tended to crowd into the open space between the bar and the tables to socialize and dance .	The place started filling up and the jukebox was playing .	when
2	128908	Before i could even get there , the bedroom door swung open and .	There he was , my brit .	but
2	127707	She attacks me with the same intensity .	I push her roughly back on the mattress .	but
4	83555	And , she felt as if electricity had suddenly bolted through her .	He walked into the room .	when
0	136045	She bows into a heavily used tissue .	Lets out a few good honks .	and
2	85250	Her stomach flipped at that last possibility .	Considering her environment , it didnt really surprise her .	but
0	159684	Flinging him six or eight inches into the air .	Robbing him of his balance .	and
0	22731	Her pants were in tatters .	A mess of blood and tissue stained both .	and
2	115195	The power of the female and her ability to produce life was once very sacred .	It posed a threat to the rise of the predominantly male church , and so the sacred feminine was demonized and called unclean .	but
3	18631	It would be better to let me kill you .	You five are so insistent on dying .	if
0	93906	`` trent ... '' `` drink it , '' he said .	I obediently took a sip , the room-temperature water bland as it slipped into me .	and
0	155437	I kissed his chin .	Slid my hand between us .	and
0	13775	* * * we walked silently to the third-floor room they shared .	Luc opened the door .	and
4	2801	He meant to get one .	He had been working a .	when
4	75966	He nearly jumped right out of his shoes .	I sat down on the front steps beside him .	when
0	99986	Pots and pans lined the walls .	Were suspended by ropes .	and
0	100926	Feeling scared and vulnerable , mara lay back on the table closed her eyes while the doctor examined her .	Placed her bare feet in the cold metal stirrups .	and
4	16208	What these documents are they 're secure-sealed but i 'll be happy .	You 've left moscow .	when
2	60275	`` i got her because she 's pretty , '' i informed him , sounding like an idiot .	Also telling the truth .	but
0	546	When i turned my head .	Met the biggest golden brown eyes ever created .	and
0	137608	Connie , all the police are out in the city tonight trying to keep the peace .	For those who dont want peace then theres the raid team .	and
4	107124	This thought exited my head .	My brother said into my ear .	when
0	82995	I watched the golden glowing shape rise like a flaming arrow into the first light of dawn .	Wondered if it would ever return .	and
0	9703	Mama , you couldnt tell me about trig , the burning implant , the hot fever .	Being kidnapped to there on top of the planet at starrtus .	and
1	20066	His appointment as chairman of the appraisal committee for public lands in la union did not qualify him as an `` experienced and competent appraiser '' in expropriation cases .	Lands involved therein are public lands and the appraisal or determination of the fair market value of said lots are not for purposes of expropriation cases ( p. 202 , roa .	because
0	19448	He was at least a head shorter than any other wizard .	Wore a simple white robe .	and
4	66414	It took locmire by surprise , but instead began to make their way toward the castle .	They did not leave the courtyard .	when
2	42951	His face was calm .	There was a dangerous glint to his eyes .	but
3	90156	He could break my bones ; whatever he had to do , he would wipe that impassive look off my face .	He could not break my composure .	if
3	137342	But , then id say you had swilled an amount of liquor from the keg bearers flagon that heartily surpassed my own .	You believe the bunk youve just spouted .	if
0	5366	Meredith tugged at the bottom of the too-short hospital gown , ready to go .	Once again draped the blanket over her bare legs .	and
2	880	They had looked for her and others from the village had gone over and looked for her .	There was no trace of her to be found .	but
4	54033	This is the moment .	Youre actually fighting yourself inside .	when
0	101286	They looked more like sisters than mother and daughter .	They were the only thing in the universe that meant anything to him .	and
0	112557	`` tell me how to open the gate . '' .	I 'll let them go .	and
2	492	I 'm not good at saying this .	I wanted you to know you were special to me .	but
3	34064	Nobody would blame me .	I turned tail and ran .	if
4	96211	In fact there was nothing questioning in him at all , only confidence .	He looked at me .	when
2	58495	I screamed out in pain .	No one heard me .	but
0	21566	Alya grabs her forehead .	Looks to her feet listen , levi .	and
0	65346	He took the pistols from the cupboard .	Offered them to edwards .	and
2	126540	Within days she had left los encinos and .	Moved into the ruins of old los angeles , or at least as much as she could find of it considering that their section of the city was the first to be targeted by the elimination crews .	but
2	141756	The zombie began to stumble .	Before the skillet had even fallen to the ground , lorie was airborne .	but
3	65877	Then all this killing would have been for nothing , and ridge would still be faced with the difficult task of starting southward , trailing rakestraw back toward his home state .	They were able to do that .	if
3	141577	A gatekeeper can only be removed from this plane , but those who are successful in imprisoning the soul of the fallen gatekeeper in the vessel of the dagger are rewarded with greater powers and flexibility to help .	They attack another gatekeeper with the dagger and fail to capture their soul , in which case , they are banished to just inside their respective realm to forever watch over its entranceway and are never allowed to return to this plane .	if
3	120618	I need to talk to kyle .	You 'll excuse us .	if
2	97567	She thought that when they 'd descended this slope during the hike in , they 'd followed a path .	She figured it would be safer now to stay off-trail .	but
2	14209	Donovan had fallen in love with them all and .	He looked forward to the day he could officially call them his and give them his name .	but
4	74780	It was one of the happiest moments of my life .	Jace and i twirled around the stained and scuffed gym floor .	when
0	77116	Quickly then reached out .	Turned on the radio .	and
2	38727	Zack started to appeal to her .	Julie 's voice interjected , soothing and encouraging .	but
4	129077	My dad dead for two years , and he left this house for me all boarded up .	I got out adler had been dead four years .	when
0	120508	William strode to the weapon rack .	Chose a seneschal blade .	and
3	122556	Whether the painting heist was anything would depend .	There was anything in the morning paper , but only if its reporter had cobbled something together before midnight when the morning daily went to press .	if
2	124876	Her expression is blank .	Her eyes shoot fire .	but
2	125443	When we got here , there wasnt no one .	We found a small blood patch over by your guys truck .	but
0	63872	One swipe of a claw could end his part on this world .	His watery legs barely carried him to the small clearing where they finally stopped .	and
0	70016	He concentrated on a memory of his room pinched space .	Reached out with green fire in his fingertips .	and
1	105428	There was no response when it hit him , bouncing off like it was rubber .	He had already passed out .	because
1	38277	For a moment , she even wondered if she could pull this off .	She 'd kept her power dormant for the past century .	because
0	139785	Of sheinas family there is still no word .	He fears that means they were all lost in the attacks .	and
2	23712	I dont think so ; oh , and she had blond hair .	The colour of her skin was decidedly light .	but
3	144702	Even serve as a guinea pig .	They can use me .	if
2	77646	She 'd turned away from them .	They had snuck into the nursery to be with their son .	but
0	155901	I jerked my hand from his .	Stopped in my tracks .	and
3	88297	Why would he have taken the necklace off before he died ? '' .	It is the windigo charm .	if
4	19019	It will be similar to synthetic tetrahydrocannibinol .	It was tested on cancer patients that had been using cannabis .	when
0	108000	She stared at him calmly . '' .	Finished , `` i think it was five , ten minutes after you 'd made me yours when you forgot i existed except as your duty to put me in the truck and take me down the mountain .	and
2	93858	I would have ruined you .	You destroyed your own career .	but
4	158726	Ari began to feel bad for her .	The nurse made no move to leave .	when
0	132169	A wildfire was racing through her .	She was eager to be consumed by the flames .	and
2	24537	Know i 'm speaking too fast and rambling .	I want to clear the air before i lose my nerve .	but
3	51748	He will tell you , et cetera , et cetera . '' .	You set him free .	if
0	17678	Gold strands leapt out of me on all sides .	They collided with the fog of power .	and
0	127403	Damn it , the man was her consort .	Should have been taking care of her .	and
4	49142	And later i could tell .	It quote got serious .	when
1	86401	Your people hated us .	They feared we would replace them .	because
0	31899	She 'd corresponded with both .	Found sashalle remarkably keen at understanding the cairhienin way of thinking .	and
0	17526	Just how hard it had been trey to hold .	Play the waiting game after those wolves attacked taryn .	and
0	83569	The biker group from maharashtra had helped us before continuing their journey .	We thought it was befitting to help these guys in return .	and
3	28595	Someone there gives you a signature .	So you hand a prisoner over to cable street .	if
0	5513	Bones finished rolling up stephanie .	Then began filling that garbage bag with her stuff .	and
4	108621	I see him hurting you . '' .	I look at him .	when
2	138001	His perfect posture and amazing good looks already set him apart from everybody .	Now him standing and everyone else on the floor it almost seemed as if we were bowing down to him .	but
2	4136	Again robert got no reaction .	Lucky asked the chatty young man what had brought him back home .	but
2	30656	Even servants travel in pairs to protect their virginities . '' .	You 're practically begging for it .	but
2	122010	The light was clear and warm .	With a definite bluish cast and the fragrances that oozed from this wet , wild world were alarming to his senses .	but
0	62800	A brawler was knocked cups for teakettle .	Tipped headlong into the street .	and
2	28113	Winston reached reflexively for her , meaning to brush her aside as he had so many others who had challenged his authority .	He managed to restrain himself .	but
3	47551	He could walk it .	He wanted to so he decided to go over and get something to eat .	if
0	31610	Impelled by some sort of fascination , i approached the sepulchre to see what it was .	Why such a thing stood alone in such a place .	and
0	72404	Laylen and i froze .	We both shot a quick glance behind us .	and
0	5284	Ive seen it in others , but i hadnt yet been put in front of a reflective surface in wolf form to find out .	Often wondered what it looked like on me .	and
2	129387	Maybe i 'm wrong ? '' .	... can you get someone out .	but
2	24087	The specifics varied from site to site .	Three basic theories ran through all of them .	but
3	23671	They would be doing so now , instead of trying to eat milt .	They did still have the capacity to eat human food .	if
3	81234	We could sail for morocco next monday .	We could be loaded in barcelona tomorrow afternoon or on sunday .	if
0	3215	To do a thing .	Then punish you for doing it .	and
2	68698	The blade of his axe missed the churchik 's arm .	The head of it did n't . .	but
2	23034	Nabonidus was a scholar for one thing , a digger into the mounds , and , yes he had a mad love for the god sin .	He was determined to keep babylon in glory .	but
3	49661	You could win some good time .	You can maintain it .	if
3	117367	It rather odd , if not quite poor behavior on our part .	We were to abandon them .	if
0	47038	He was even more startled when a dark shadow separated from one of the bikes , walked to the old truck that miss winter had emerged from .	Moved around it slowly , stooping near each tire for several seconds .	and
4	99985	I had been seven years old .	I realized it wasnt normal to always go to a white room filled with five other people when you dream .	when
2	8291	I tried to stop them .	Casey vector punched me in the stomach , which sent me to the floor , cowering in agony .	but
4	36775	And normally you stop looking .	You find what you 're looking for .	when
4	49907	I thought back with a shudder to the night .	O and i had parted ways .	when
4	78897	He pulled up short .	He saw me and walked over to lean on the fender of the cooper .	when
2	106441	Burden shifted in his seat .	Any discomfort he felt was quickly masked with an air of superiority .	but
2	21595	The world is full of psychiatrists , and he simply did not know .	He could easily have found another if he had known bass had a problem .	but
3	109585	He could peel the paper in six inch long strips , revealing the yellow glue underneath .	He was very careful .	if
0	112808	As we scrambled forward , another crash echoed through the hall .	A shimmering fog seeped into the palace .	and
0	123628	Yes , hed seen it .	He squinted , turning the weapon over in his hands as he tested the edge with his finger .	and
3	80416	Then i can kill them , legally , not as your human servant but as a u.s .	I can prove them guilty .	if
0	124527	With one last look , he changed into his crow form .	Left her to the protection of his friend and allies .	and
0	56956	Then i gripped him to me and .	Danced him forcibly to the crowd .	and
4	97685	Zack 's eyes light up .	He spots me emerging .	when
2	73986	He had done it .	If i was logical , i 'd have made the familiar bond active between us and forced him to be nice to me .	but
4	18137	To control my breathing .	Those fantastic , flashy pictures of us naked entered my mind .	when
2	114805	Part of me felt sorry for her .	I crushed that feeling .	but
0	11523	I put one hand on her mouth .	Pour the poison through the cracks of my fingers .	and
0	155252	Pelas bowed to the ground .	Departed from the hall .	and
4	78351	... '' i grab my purse , locking the car door before pulling my hair into a low knot to keep it out of my face .	You put it that way .	when
2	53792	I thought someone else was backing him .	I never thought it might be against the best interests of riversea , let alone myself as his banker .	but
0	114440	A smile appeared on his face .	He curled his arms over his headshowing everyone his flexed arms .	and
0	45732	She looked back to her canvas turned towards me .	Put down her brush .	and
4	60442	Temporal lives , aside from seven weeks a year .	They are free to use their powers while training marks .	when
2	56700	I 'll do what i can , scar . '' .	I 'm with rob .	but
3	34820	We constantly correct people .	They refer to us as sallys father and his friend .	if
0	42452	She crawls out of the water .	Hears the violins drifting further and .	and
3	83031	That 's a joke .	I ever heard one .	if
3	128117	And why would she have wanted to .	She 'd already decided to make herself available to wealthy men for a living .	if
0	47723	People moved through the streets .	There was an unnatural silence that fell over us .	and
4	58440	But i 've seen prudence here in the temple-she ordained brother conwell .	He replaced his mother as leader of this region , about seven or eight years .	when
2	138033	Kendra bit her lip .	Reluctantly started to scan the room .	but
2	39000	He thinks i 'm going to . '' .	The second i can sneak away , i 'm leaving .	but
1	146820	Then ill be just like her , worse than her .	Ill be just like her and weak .	because
0	14158	I slid onto the empty barstool next to him .	Sat down without being asked .	and
4	130991	What they were getting themselves in the past .	They interfered so dont wallow .	when
0	11696	Curiba was not moved , after all , she was the black knight .	She knew despite her initial displeasure , that it was all true .	and
4	32318	He asked , `` an ' you 're mike what ? '' .	The other man made no response except a vague nod .	when
0	107770	Hastily , luton scrambled free , then eased the horse he 'd been holding to its feet removed the cloth from about its head .	Shook himself so that he could help unknot the sheeting holding the horses .	and
3	8072	He could attest to the fact that there was no man more loyaland lovingthan bugs harrington .	His dear friend timmy wicketts could be here today .	if
4	110569	Are you so different ? '' .	You 're being held accountable .	when
2	89814	She turned the handle as she spoke .	The door did not yield .	but
4	120313	Sighing , she began to scratch the word key into the glass .	Sabin slammed a fist into the stones ' case , shattering the outer shell .	when
0	13826	Tor had to get home .	He had to get .	and
3	128447	Bull could not immediately tell .	It was from kyle or the bear .	if
2	48338	By noon she 'd be fine and and she 'd need that lunch .	Her appetite would return .	but
4	19484	He decided not to give her any more .	She had put away seven glasses of tullamore dew in a little over two hours .	when
2	108664	You would sound preposterous on the surface .	The more you thought about it , the more you would realize only your perspective prevented it from being true .	but
3	127244	Turned ass up in the barn with pa laying into her with a belt .	She gave the wrong answer to that question she would end up back on the farm .	if
2	11975	His gaze fell briefly to the blood trickling down my palms to pool on the floor .	He wasnt concerned that i might escape .	but
2	128076	Sure , i had to keep my work phone on me at all times .	That was mostly to answer to my bosses .	but
2	79634	Prodded him a bit .	He dint want to move , sir .	but
3	49224	One soon reaches the fatal idea of something standardised-some common kind of life to which all nations ought to progress .	One is thinking simply of goodness in the abstract .	if
0	131381	The fire had died down , the sun had long ago set .	Jack and i were in a little circle of light .	and
0	25054	`` well , '' fadeout said carefully , `` we all know that wyrm has a violent temper .	He 's totally devoted to kien .	and
0	127705	Ethan is a true gentleman .	I cant forgive myself , im happy you are his .	and
4	78857	You come see me , babe .	You 're done slumming it with that douche .	when
3	93582	It 'd still be best .	You could discourage him .	if
2	127994	He did not know them well , and he hated the revulsion in their eyes .	He had grown to like them over the past few weeks .	but
2	76956	When matt caught her looking at him , they matched gazes .	It quickly grew awkward .	but
0	133458	She turned in his arms .	Tipped her face up to look at him .	and
0	34317	That not only was there a little box inside me keeping me breathing , then a week later morag blushed world-wide .	There was also a very large battery powered tape recorder whirring away 24/7 , and around the world relatives and friends had renewed hope for their loved ones that were in a coma .	and
1	101298	Mama , the brave shadowhawk was being chased by the posse .	There had been a robbery in linksville and they thought shadowhawk had done it just because he was different from everybody else in town .	because
0	11144	Thought better of it snapped it shut .	He opened his mouth , like he was going to say something , but .	and
0	139709	Just needed to put that love to death .	Then i could move on .	and
0	295	I was getting the sense that this universe was not as advanced as ours .	All evidence was suggesting this was very true .	and
2	72789	I usually just say my mom read it in a book .	Actually , a fortune teller gave her the name .	but
2	28593	Sean and mel are arguing .	Their voices turn to noise as apprehension fills my stomach .	but
3	55481	He needed every advantage he could get .	Even that meant aligning himself with the worst creatures ever to roam this earth .	if
2	105489	He tried to put weight on his legs .	The pain made it impossible .	but
3	32530	You were lucky - the boat would sit well in the water and run fast with the wind .	Rupert gringe had worked on the boat .	if
0	62110	She was ten years old .	Belle 's hand went to her mouth .	and
0	116386	She suspected shallan of stealing the soulcaster .	No longer trusted her .	and
4	50216	Not , and someone said , `` hold still . '' .	The strong arms wrapped around me .	when
2	41966	Shortly don died bones talked him out of it .	Fueled by grief into wanting even more to strike a blow against .	but
0	159436	Seven went loup , two were killed with their mother when a rival pack ambushed them , one challenged jarek and lost .	That leaves him with desandra .	and
2	52916	He was letting down his band mates .	Hed never make it through any of the dance numbers .	but
2	155836	I know , so he wont be able to ignore the problem for much longer .	I did talk him into going south when it gets light .	but
2	8906	It hurts to say it .	It 's the truth .	but
1	112987	More than the collected materials are worthbut it makes economic sense for cities .	They save on landfill fees .	because
2	25584	I 'll make the drop . '' .	I 'm probably going to need a little somethin ' somethin ' for my efforts .	but
2	39138	Reardon has a reputation as a hatchet man .	If you watch how he behaves , he 's actually a one-trick performer .	but
3	97087	I 'd show them the paper and say i was bringing everything to ser lyonel .	The guards tried to stop me .	if
2	35467	He didnt want anything to do with god .	Thats what it took to spend time with her , hed survive .	but
3	16415	Of course it was so invisible as to be invisible .	You accepted the very strong denials of last night .	if
2	50116	I think he was good , it kind of blinded him .	He was very consumed in the money he made .	but
4	115206	You do not understand the art of perfect timing .	It comes to your first seduction .	when
2	58295	She would never get over what calleigh did .	Hayden was a different story .	but
2	135357	Greg took a threatening step .	Webb stopped him with a look .	but
3	126955	Right at that moment .	It was possible to hate jess .	if
2	89831	Her legs pedal faster with her breath and her heartbeat .	Oxygen isnt reaching her brain , and her eyesight is failing her .	but
3	146834	It would be really nice .	You would just stay by my side .	if
4	61679	She had scarcely entered .	She began to agitate her nose and her jaws after the example of her clerks .	when
2	21590	He should have felt reluctance-he did feel it .	The wakening sensations , affection , stirrings of love mixed with passion and his heightened senses were all unexpected .	but
3	50213	Again you will feel my fist against your face a lot harder next time .	I hear you say anything like that .	if
0	17957	His face was broken .	Bloody , his entire left arm covered in his own blood as he suffered numerous cuts from broken glass .	and
2	44919	Agatha almost managed to conceal her frustration .	Her anxiety was all too evident in the way her body tensed with every passing second we stood out in the open .	but
4	107876	Then i 'd worry `` so you 've had no yearning for children or marriage or anything like that ? '' .	It became a problem .	when
3	82072	They would understand the message .	It did go through .	if
4	21470	Did the towns and the fiddly bits .	We got to junctions in the road .	when
2	63774	When they got to the ultrasound room they wheeled erin in and dare went to follow .	The doctor put up his hand .	but
3	109328	On the other hand it would make things a lot quicker and simpler .	The fish people could find molk for them .	if
0	117698	He sat in a chair .	Pulled me down on his lap .	and
2	19450	He coiled for the jump .	Just as he pushed off , he felt a quick and cold tingle shoot across his neck and down his spine .	but
4	65249	Like the safety lock she 'd used .	The kids were small .	when
4	20145	Living under the spotlight .	He still ran his company .	when
0	99898	He hailed her with a raised arm ... then sagged back into ugly despair .	Her heart kicked up a notch .	and
2	128126	His other hand began to tug off his boxer briefs , and the hand in my hair held me .	I tried to look down at what he was doing .	but
0	131949	These were the great warriors of the seelie court .	They fought , but nothing could touch us .	and
4	50327	To check out the flotation tanks at his new york gym .	He returned , and which he had always previously dismissed as being new age and faddish .	when
0	109560	To keep those horrible fangs from her jugular .	Now , as they fought less fiercely for a moment , to regain their breath .	and
1	48018	At least let me pay for those , '' he said .	Any mortal would insist on the same , but diana shook her head .	because
4	79131	She gave it to me .	I told her i felt like throwing up .	when
2	57452	Cronus 's form began to blur into black fog .	As soon as it started , white light encased him , and he growled .	but
2	33523	In its enigmatic soul it was kin to every other piece of luggage throughout the multiverse , and .	Preferred to spend its winters hibernating on top of a wardrobe .	but
2	128440	Not just she loved him .	The lives of everyone she 'd ever loved were at risk .	but
2	108417	There had been a few fires .	The people that lived nearby had put them out .	but
2	38026	There were many suggestions of hate and vengeance swarming about the raven-eaters mind .	The dominating thought was that he could not kill her , and so he would use her to build his kingdom in the land of the living .	but
1	120585	I wouldnt want to do that .	Then everyone would think i was peculiar .	because
0	158988	Nails raked down his .	He nearly hissed in pain .	and
0	45637	She got up , holding a glass of water and a few pills in her hand .	Came to sit across from me at the table .	and
4	82631	We were stunned to realize that i would have to leave for new york in ten days .	We looked at a calendar and compared the dates .	when
4	139248	And i feel it in the air , like static electricity .	I 'm near you .	when
2	12386	In fact , it was too eerie and before he left , something caught his eye .	So he darted to his room to get in and out as fast as possible .	but
0	72109	She was his direction .	The path seemed very clear to him .	and
2	57844	Picture this : woman and boy are let free from the brooding castle keep .	There 's a catch .	but
0	121207	I jumped up to give him a hug .	Urged him to sit down .	and
0	78523	Thinking of the little creature dying in her dream , ivy 's face blanched , do you think we might have .	She felt sick to her stomach .	and
0	124009	Later , if things went awry between them , he would wipe his memory from her mind .	Send her on her way .	and
1	14026	Sadly , you would never understand such a thing .	You 're just a human .	because
4	118735	Convincing alexander about my brilliant plan was another thing , `` the dullsville auction , '' i said .	We met inside the rail yard boxcar .	when
3	8653	I 'll look an utter fool .	It is a wandering singer or one of lord brune 's sons .	if
2	62071	For a second after i snapped at him , i thought devon might turn around and leave me standing there by myself .	He did n't . .	but
2	55583	I danced backward at the ensuing uproar .	Al took my upper arm and strode forward , nose in the air , buckled shoes snapping , and velveteen coattails swaying .	but
3	136194	`` how are you going to find another vampire ? '' .	They 're forbidden from coming .	if
3	62895	It will be good for him . '' .	We can get him to take some of it the next time he rouses .	if
2	14928	His voice was a reverent whisper that fed my feminine ego .	The words broke me from my day-dream of following the parted v of his shirt and popping the buttons one by one .	but
3	89481	We can not send out rangers .	We seal the gates .	if
4	145291	Wanted to know what rowling had meant .	She said doodle had swapped sides .	when
2	144092	Maisy rolled her eyes .	Held her hand out for tommy and they walked toward the tree .	but
0	57538	I knew she had to be .	Had shoulder-length hair the same dark shade as cole 's .	and
0	126539	Lafleur would only have to touch one of us with her electrical magic .	It would zip through all of our bodies like chain lightning .	and
1	11898	Only , the bag made me nervous .	For some reason , it kick-started my imagination , pushing it to run wild with images of sex toys and kinky lingerie .	because
1	61992	The piano was easiest for me . '' .	I could watch the performer 's fingers and see how a particular piece was played .	because
0	145434	Had the cloud-girl inspired some want in me , some longing at all , i would have invited her into my bed .	Flaunted her before my husband .	and
0	81447	Benol refused . '' .	The warlock had his grizzly chain benol in a cell .	and
4	114399	She had just gotten ahold of the necessary items .	Ducky appeared at her side with a wooden bowl containing the requested feathers .	when
4	32464	One of the hotel 's limos stood waiting at the curb .	They got downstairs and he helped serena into it , before settling next to her .	when
2	50023	There were a handful of people in the diner .	No one paid him any attention .	but
0	94240	His lip would twitch .	I 'd know he was about to turn toward me , so i would hurry and look at my paper .	and
0	121650	He reached the carriage .	Hefted the princess inside .	and
4	6043	Where his thoughts go .	He finds a beautiful , naked woman in his shower .	when
2	70590	She laughed for a minute longer , and his heart felt a bit too heavy for it .	Dennis did his best to join in .	but
2	63959	The crawlspace just below is dark and damp .	Compared to where i live , it might as well be a living room .	but
2	45806	We can stay here about two hours .	Then we have to leave .	but
4	70953	On the way i had told sir horace , `` , you have to pretend that is who you are .	Someone with a really annoying squeaky voice calls you dad .	when
2	73853	He 'd have to remember that calling all the shots at the office was one thing .	He 'd have to exercise a little more diplomacy when they were discussing what he thought she should do in her personal life .	but
4	105247	But darkness consumed my mind .	I was almost above the mass .	when
3	146863	You will know that evil has indeed befallen us .	We do not return in that time .	if
4	153151	Just that he ran off like his ass was on fire . '' .	He realized you 'd gone to layla 's the other day .	when
3	89022	It 's not denial . '' .	You acknowledge said problem .	if
3	49865	What would he do .	I didnt came back from marys laboratory .	if
2	143377	He would join them when he could .	Most of the time there were other , more important matters for him to attend to .	but
0	53584	Gregori is severely wounded .	Yet he rises to do his job guarding the prince .	and
0	54482	Jamie looked back at the two , his arm around her .	Now noticed that she had her head lying on his shoulder .	and
2	92175	The ducks were nothing more than dumb animals .	As he sliced through the first neck , the other twelve ducks seemed to quack out in fear .	but
4	75915	We both took a lot of flak for it .	We became friends back in ellensburg .	when
0	101317	The message to make sense .	Yet , he had .	and
0	56775	He took the offered hand .	Stepped closer to the lady .	and
1	57200	She kept going on and on about how christine was a bitch . '' .	The phantom needed her love and support .	because
4	76135	Attributing a work to a major artist .	In reality it was a copy .	when
2	140584	Yeah , it was still quiet in here ( for the most part .	The air in the building was anything but peaceful .	but
2	143884	`` that 's what i 've been telling these guys for the past two weeks .	They insist on calling me romeo .	but
0	16854	Running his hand along the walls .	Marvelling at the light fixtures .	and
0	25470	She sat up but it didnt .	Expected her head to pound .	and
2	155220	The best at reading trails could , to find out where they went and if they were going to the place i both hoped and feared they were .	I would do the best i .	but
0	30021	A hand suddenly patted my back .	I turned slightly , seeing tanner kneel behind elaine .	and
4	8111	You 're sitting down it 's not usually to deliver good news .	Somebody asks . '' .	when
3	131271	She 'd be right about this .	She 's been right about everything .	if
2	52233	He didnt go into too much detail .	I wasnt going to push .	but
2	30447	Visually , there was no change in jasper 's countenance .	His clipped response spoke volumes .	but
1	156675	I couldnt even look at it if i saw as well as smelled it , i would have to eat it .	I knew if i did .	because
1	55058	He must have lifted . '' .	His voice came from above as his hand cupped my sex and he said , `` nothin ' is weird .	because
0	91975	Feel your place in the universe .	See how vast it is .	and
0	121333	We volunteered for a service project .	Ended up being of much more service than we ever dreamed of .	and
3	6965	Jim turned to her and i promise you that is no lie , you could threaten me as you have done to so many others .	I didnt already have a surgeon more skilled than you .	if
1	76426	I noticed a shirtless guy seated on the couch that i had to assume was linc .	He was checking me out as soon as we stepped inside the apartment .	because
0	97078	I halted our journey as alita asked why we had stopped .	Slid out my knife .	and
0	4915	I grabbed him by the back of the head slammed him up against the wall .	He tried to run when he set his eyes on me , but .	and
0	53121	The nymphs ' magic would dissipate .	They 'd lose their connection to the water .	and
0	55937	The young man shielded his head with a forearm , which took the brunt of the blow .	Then twisted to the side and out of the parasol 's reach .	and
1	125152	Instead she 'd chosen this spot ... of her future .	It afforded her a view .	because
3	103297	She would be ready to do her duty .	Indeed there was a crime to be avenged , and a killer to be brought to justice .	if
4	43221	Tubules in the legs automatically inflate using bleed air from the engines .	The g-forces go above eight .	when
0	90423	In a her breathing calmed .	She could again hear the birds .	and
4	10136	My dad died and my mother remarried .	I was a baby .	when
2	60255	Maybe it was thinking of loki and his split face .	As i looked at logan , i was once again reminded of how different we were .	but
0	146833	This was just for carly me .	I loved maddy , but .	and
1	79582	And as i can surmise from reports years ago , you become unconscious .	Only a tiny portion of your mana remains to keep you alive .	because
3	43989	Armand argeneau had another think coming .	That was what he thought .	if
0	146335	Cole caught me , my head on his chest .	Held me close to him .	and
4	79969	Come hurtling from the sky at him .	He goes out to face the enemy .	when
0	110540	Eryks first public court was rapidly approaching .	She was trying to sort the petitions into an order that would be reasonably balanced .	and
4	30144	Who hold up their hands and make circular motions .	They talk about the buffet at the rio but .	when
1	18144	She was a moment understanding him .	He 'd used the old fremen name for the great worm .	because
4	1360	Why dont you ever make eye contact .	Were hav**g s*x ? .	when
0	93884	This is all very well detailed in the codes .	... '' he trailed off as lift yawned .	and
0	97560	When i win this war , and keep you in a cage for her to throw bones to when it amuses her . '' .	I will , i will rule with my sister beside me .	and
3	64496	Of these bodies that you are chasing they are less substantial than the ideas that you are pounding your head to procure .	You are in fact chasing them , material form stalking the material , when as you say , unable to find absolute truth , whatever particular gender they happen to be .	if
0	154691	They loved each other .	It was obvious even without words .	and
3	13526	I would see the bright princess-pink spark that burned at the very center of her being .	I put my hand on top of hers .	if
3	112646	I will break your neck .	You do anything to endanger kane , or any of the others .	if
0	130001	He pivoted , his gaze strafing the sky above , then every shadow .	Headed back to the main street on a run .	and
0	113834	My head was swimming .	I wanted nothing more than to curl up with amy and ignore the world .	and
2	140901	I might have ten grand in the bank .	I need that to buy a flat for me and my baby .	but
0	51	The manager glanced up from the monitor he was looking at .	Nodded at vijay to enter and take a seat .	and
2	160337	There stood another woman .	She seemed to glow with a faint green light , an aura .	but
2	45003	She couldnt do it until she was sixteen next year .	As soon as her birthday came , she would be .	but
3	87752	And endangering her is exactly what would happen .	I forced my way in .	if
4	152425	It exploded into a wall of fire .	The witchfire met the gray shield .	when
0	27633	I will enchant your horses .	Offer incantations to protect you .	and
2	32579	`` that 's right , '' jericho slapped my knee .	I felt his magic flare next to me .	but
3	31419	I will cut your lips off .	They touch that blessed drink before mine do . '' .	if
0	19967	With that , he reached .	Pushed the door open .	and
4	9016	Did you talk to him .	He was with your regiment .	when
3	147185	`` that 's . '' .	I still have a job .	if
2	144253	It was an intriguing idea .	I knew that kellan 's heart lied with music .	but
3	133668	You may be able to repair some of the damage .	You stop and think .	if
2	46839	He heard the scrape of a heel on stone saw nothing .	Turned his head toward the sound .	but
2	83028	Savanah prayed she was wrong .	It was the only answer that made any sense .	but
0	56518	These nightmares were fuzzy disorienting and .	Always , the particulars slipped away before i could put them .	and
4	130641	Somehow i became separated from the others .	We went out onto the pack .	when
2	78555	My classmates act like they 're entitled to their good fortune .	Tate is different , and i admire him for it .	but
2	56817	Rose would probably give him a lecture about taking a baby into a combat situation .	That was too damned bad .	but
0	53941	Who fearlessly confronted cyclopes .	Brought the hulking misfits to their knees .	and
2	23789	He left it there so that it was the first thing everyone would see as they approached the front door .	He didnt do this entirely for the purposes of display .	but
2	108578	Well , i suppose some of it will be .	The demons and malphas are unknown entities in reality .	but
4	32914	She liked this play and started to cry .	Willow was not sure .	when
2	148019	The word on the street becomes the news in the journal .	I have my doubts .	but
0	75927	These two now appeared .	Stood smiling and bowing .	and
3	11378	Now it is your choice .	That means you are honest with us or we have to take the information from you .	if
0	56257	Light exploded behind my eyes .	I dropped to my hands and knees at the bottom of the stairway .	and
0	142207	Trial by knife that fat homo told em scar drank , nearly killed some woman and broke both her legs .	Then drove his motorcycle .	and
2	31058	A few seconds later , dred ran into the room , covered in blood .	From what jael could tell , she was in one piece .	but
2	99972	The sun was setting in surrey .	It was high overhead in north korea .	but
4	17942	They frowned , then glanced at reyes .	Some of the guests , especially the men , looked at her .	when
1	66750	The knives were my weapons of choice on most jobs .	They were sharp , strong , and almost unbreakable .	because
3	146538	`` so , go win this case and add fifty zeroes to your bank balance . '' .	You want to keep me as your super beautiful and sexy wife .	if
3	159389	She couldnt buy into it .	Even you made that known to her .	if
2	65372	A stadium full of squealing teen girls was not my idea of a good time , '' she shuddered , `` .	Her show was actually really entertaining .	but
2	121599	He 's got three-white and orange and yellow . '' .	He only wants the yellow one .	but
2	13993	Harry walks out of the room slowly , shuffling , and mary just shakes her head at the absurdity of it all .	Looking older than he is .	but
0	68220	He would stop me .	Also hoping hed give me something to put out the flames in my throat .	and
4	84436	I wrap my arm around her as her tears roll down her face .	Candace 's cries start to break through .	when
0	77113	Gabriel closed his eyes .	Was asleep in moments .	and
4	136940	A drunken camp follower offered to pleasure strongboar with her mouth .	The three of them stepped off the ferry on the north bank .	when
2	124920	Everyone knew their role .	Aria wanted them to suit up and walk through their parts-a good idea considering jupiter 's and soren 's inexperience .	but
2	123061	I pull my leg back so he misses .	He 's able to get his hands on the staff .	but
1	144640	To take power and organization away from the neo-nazi groups .	Only with organization and money can they afford to buy stolen serbian nerve agent .	because
0	67304	Had i been in any other situation , i would have been talking to everyone .	Asking questions for posterity 's sake .	and
4	77133	Since she 'd been clean , and going to meetings , she was just i remembered her being .	I was a kid .	when
3	119484	Layton would kick my ass .	I got his wood floors wet .	if
0	150378	Hed run out of the mouth of the cave .	Limped back to the point where hed left the rifle .	and
2	52615	Rochelle and judge stephanopoulos remained in the doorway , watching intently from the periphery .	Not missing a thing .	but
0	124102	Greece , spain , portugal and ireland had all dropped out of the common currency .	Reverted to their pre euro coinage .	and
0	87111	When i finally noticed that cole was gone , i opened the back door .	Retrieved his clothing from the yard .	and
4	73393	How much time had passed .	The spanking abruptly stopped .	when
0	60086	Who see one another all day .	Are now seeing one another all evening .	and
3	131836	I had no idea ; it might have nothing to do with their rate of descent .	It did because i had no idea why skydivers fell this way .	if
2	76695	She felt the worried frown furrow her forehead .	Couldnt make it go .	but
3	156275	She might be able to get logic to overpower fear .	She had more time .	if
1	107742	`` you can leave .	The time has arrived for you to leave .	because
4	5506	They would be in agreement on keeping us apart even if the reasons were polar opposites .	It came to our parents ' opinions about us being .	when
0	88402	Next best to the drink of life , '' its first ad had read .	Vampires had responded to the ad campaign .	and
2	57359	Some of the offices had to be turned into a maternity ward at colby 's insistence .	That turned out to be an attraction .	but
4	50559	I 'd felt like i was the last person in the world to find out .	I 'd first discovered the alchemists .	when
1	10795	Do you think i needed you any less , ? '' .	Only i could feed myself .	because
2	74541	With this , the old woman turned to leave .	Hesitated for a moment .	but
0	154608	She watched him go head to the front of the restaurant where the restrooms were located .	Watched him cross the room .	and
4	64762	The lock from goodness knows .	I melded the door with my bare shimmering hands .	when
2	123407	Then opened her mouth to speak .	She closed it again as she tried to arrange her thoughts .	but
3	40514	I see that it would be of no use to tell you to stay away from her .	Even that were her wish .	if
0	103291	If the pain had been outside her , where she could sink her claws into it , she would have kicked bit and .	Shredded it to ribbons .	and
3	103210	Id like to learn how to work the coffee maker she replied .	You wouldnt mind teaching me .	if
3	156790	`` , farrell 's offer is withdrawn . '' .	You attempt to do that .	if
0	118891	Carrying the bucket of coins .	Wearing a gardening glove on his hand to protect himself from the coins ' power .	and
4	64719	The beer fizzed up so fast i had to slug some down or make a mess .	I popped the top .	when
0	130688	Youll have to fly out this afternoon fly back tomorrow night .	Stay overnight in a hotel .	and
2	128954	Watching , whispering among themselves they make no move to stop us .	Peeking out the door and .	but
2	12362	At first garion thought she was a child .	As she came closer , he realized that she was somewhat older than that .	but
2	105660	I may have been doing other things .	It all , i was still waiting .	but
2	71770	If he wanted to turn himself in , that was his business .	I wasnt going to add to the fallout of what he did by destroying his and phyllis lives .	but
2	63556	Darrin had lost his water blaster on the way .	He worked a spare from his commando belt and blasted the branch .	but
2	67414	Some had seen it coming from quite a long way away and some realised it only when it was almost in their faces .	Everyone was equally horrified by this .	but
2	75545	There was a hesitation for leadership .	Kele stepped forward and up we went , grabbing onto trees and branches and moving around boulders .	but
4	40790	He never returns the same .	A man goes away to war .	when
4	51942	The hostess appears in front of the window , aims her gun toward me and shoots several rounds .	Right i lock my door .	when
4	5101	Things had come to a pretty pass .	They had to play nigger rock and roll music like that on the local country music station .	when
2	90794	He saw hamish in one of these shadows .	The lad was pointing out things to nandita , his voice loud , words slow while he explained the fete to her .	but
4	86473	He was pissed , but it was nothing special .	He came out a little later .	when
0	51415	Cole cupped my cheeks .	Brought my gaze back to him .	and
0	152730	Just be sweet gentle and while he did all the important things like running the country and being the bread winner .	Take care of the mans castle .	and
2	153383	`` no , that is a more recent development .	They 've always been a hungry species that has sought to curb that hunger in many ways .	but
2	2514	Berit looked a bit puzzled .	He reached out with his axe and gave the rigid corpse a good shove .	but
0	46448	Miss latorena went to her table , and rejoined errol .	Took a record book .	and
2	56549	My arrival attracted a small amount of attention from a few people near the drop off point .	They soon returned to their affairs when i failed to be interesting .	but
0	158224	Bounding out until he resembled an overexcited polar bear .	Rolling in the snow .	and
0	53984	One runway covers 200 acres of land nods chuckles with islander .	Publicly owned the city of decatur , alabama and open to the public for use like my free library card .	and
0	54433	I put only a handful of tank tops and a couple of pairs of shorts .	Sleep pants in the `` keep '' pile .	and
1	154396	Saffi would reject him .	Rumors had also been rife about the prince 's kingdom considering an alliance with the palestine government .	because
2	37674	Papa turned to us and i thought he would tell us to run and hide ? '' .	Instead he said , `` what 's life without adventure .	but
2	74366	I 've never liked perfume .	Tonight i feel like the situation calls for it .	but
4	103184	My body began to repair itself , until i hit the ground .	I was falling from the realm of light .	when
0	41335	Making sure no one was watching , ari tucked a hand behind her chair .	Let her magic focus on creating a cell phone with charlie 's number in it .	and
0	3913	Determined not to be seen , she made her way down the opposite side of the thoroughfare , past the facades of the pavilions decorated with the styles and iconography of the nations they were meant to represent .	She surveyed the men standing outside the long , ornately decorated pavilion across from her .	and
2	145949	Of course it wasnt called atlantis , not by the people who lived .	The civilization was real and in some ways we believe they were more advanced than we are today , and in others , somewhat primitive .	but
3	139395	Where would el diablo live .	We cut it down .	if
0	15224	We dressed the thing carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows , as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in arkham .	There was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape , but .	and
2	110974	Eventually , they were both feeling a little better .	As it was nearly time for the lunchtime meal , they decided to eat before going out to resume their job hunting .	but
0	6053	The girl hooked one of her tiny fingers in her mouth .	Waited for her mother .	and
0	23675	He snatched my wrists crashed into me .	I tried to yank away , but .	and
3	101137	Then he would have left work immediately to attend these matters .	His wife had but called to inform him of unknown relatives turning up at his home .	if
0	2432	Like his talking to a particularly dim child .	I give him the stink eye .	and
2	113948	Our motivations may be different .	I believe that they are equally valid reasons .	but
2	132270	Meredith looked sharply at vi as she continued .	You got ta jump , man .	but
1	59037	I tried to stay out of chain 's way .	I knew what he was capable of .	because
2	98713	I wanted to help her get over the monsters in her nightmares .	Was helpless to do anything about them other than to hold her while she slept at night .	but
0	9019	I whirled around , losing more hair .	Smashed my knee up at the same time .	and
0	141093	The bomb makers name is abreeq .	The terrorist is called ammar .	and
3	124017	Well i can decide .	This is an amateurish mistake or a brilliant move .	if
2	32297	I tried to gasp .	It was so hard to breathe .	but
4	80224	Ollie obeyed he knew not to say no to derek .	Derek called ollie to help him dispose of the bodies .	when
3	122435	I have asked dr. evon .	You and i could go to the main land .	if
0	154972	My curls relaxed under his touch .	Smoothed into a silk-soft curtain .	and
0	9120	She retrieved two large bath towels from the linen closet .	Tossed one at nick .	and
4	76650	Youre here on a monday .	I made a point of telling you i only work on tuesdays and thursdays .	when
2	33935	It wasnt the comfiest thing in the world .	Id been sleeping hunched up in cars for days , so if felt like the most decadent of pleasures just to lie prone and stretch out .	but
0	146473	She had long black hair curling down all around her .	She were wearing a white dress with gold bits on it .	and
4	126698	His hand in my hair fisted , `` and i watched my father die during a challenge .	His voice dropped as he shared .	when
2	54794	The beavers brought her water lilies to eat , and she would not chew them , and they fell out .	Even tried to put them in her mouth .	but
4	122958	But , i 'm afraid she was already lost .	I saw the body after the fire .	when
2	93915	Michaels face was blank .	I noticed that his shoulders tensed just a bit .	but
4	124998	Who were unfortunate suffered with great pain and agony in the hands of the golem .	It squeezed the blood out them .	when
2	70583	I knew it was a bit of a rude , not to mention personal question .	My interviewing tactics had gotten bolder these days .	but
2	61214	`` it really is , '' i insisted .	Quickly stopped speaking when constantijin came strolling .	but
2	126299	Snagars are related to them .	Look like natural animals .	but
2	12062	I 'm glad to have her back .	I know there 's work you got ta do .	but
0	129846	She grabbed fazire by the cheeks .	Pulled his head to her , tipping it down and kissing it on the top .	and
3	108961	This one was an irving 5-0 .	The datapad was correct .	if
2	156257	They each tried to sleep .	Only glana managed a few hours .	but
2	3251	I have used diplomacy for centuries . '' .	It 's not i lack skill with any weapon .	but
4	28747	They had traveled a couple of kilometers .	Christopher 's phone rang .	when
0	122513	I stand to leave , and i face the screen as words in bold red letters scroll across it .	The computer flickers like a tv when the reception is interrupted .	and
0	5	Final y they turned , perhaps calculating the better part of valor , shoulders hunched in disappointment .	Began walking away back down the french side of the mountain .	and
0	114846	You will be mine beyond reprieve , and devote your life to me only . '' .	It will be easier for you to forget all that went before that time .	and
0	117186	Toni scooted over closer to tessie and whispered , do we dare leave this room .	Wrapped her arm around her shoulder .	and
2	19442	They dug a little way down , and .	This passageway , too , collapsed : designed for its maker , and not the weight of dragons or shovel-wielding men , or perhaps only ever intended to be temporary .	but
2	90	Eric 's eyes stop scanning the room , and .	He starts toward a table .	but
2	72370	I racked my brain trying to remember if i had heard anything about this movie .	Was drawing a blank .	but
4	40554	Todd slaps his flank gently and up he stands .	I 'm sat in the saddle .	when
2	87896	Felix looked uncomfortable and marched off to the hatch .	Schooled his expression to one of bland superiority .	but
0	6713	Tiger 's growl increased .	Ellison leaned close to ethan .	and
3	9433	You must allow me my breath , unless you are willing to forget it .	I am to relate this tale to you .	if
2	108190	I used to be a christian .	Then i became an agnostic , now i choose not to take any position .	but
3	42810	`` now we have some celebrating to do . '' .	You 'll excuse us .	if
2	136026	I was with lena , and .	For just one second , it was all that mattered .	but
0	4835	The man grasped his hand pleading , catch them , ere they find the orb , they must not have it .	Grimacing at the effort .	and
0	47129	They reached one of the great interval towers .	Were greeted by a stern looking kiseran warrior guarding the door .	and
4	118600	All of the dorms are full .	School is in session .	when
2	37143	How could she have dragged bodies into the basement , and .	Built the breeze-block wall .	but
2	142525	Now normally derrick would just be hanging out with his friends .	Aaron was busy with summertime gardening and darrin was at the store with his mom -- for better reasons than you might think -- thus the reason why derrick was playing with his pitiful collection of superhero action figures .	but
3	25941	After that you will die . '' .	You have not completed your task .	if
1	160072	You 'll accept some assistance in that role today .	I 'd really like everyone to be engaged .	because
2	120743	`` there 's no lock , '' she says , `` . '' .	I can certainly close it .	but
2	136537	Yes he straightens his uniform , i can not go with you .	I offer the same to you .	but
2	133009	I thump her hard .	We 're both laughing .	but
2	90579	I know this sounds awful .	You know what i really miss .	but
2	20006	His daughter , imprisoned in a castle , shut off from the world .	What her caretakers thought was appropriate .	but
4	40998	That always hit her .	He touched her happened .	when
0	29061	He pictured the crossbow in his mind .	Envisioned its crosswire snapping .	and
3	42486	Just say the word and we 're out of here . '' .	You want to leave at any time .	if
4	99346	I was just about to give up , move away from the door , give eric his privacy .	He shouted , because i made her a fucking promise .	when
2	47969	It killed me to do it .	I knew she needed the closure at least .	but
4	118726	Moving my shoulders up and .	Ian 's face is suddenly hovering over me .	when
0	150167	Turning toward the less formal side of the room , lucivar settled into a chair designed to accommodate eyrien wings .	Accepted the glass of brandy .	and
1	50513	It caught henrietta 's attention .	It was very careful .	because
2	31942	Colby never saw nicolas move .	He was there in front of her , taking the weapon from paul and dragging him into his terrible embrace .	but
0	12097	He works for a glassmaker called torgan .	Torgan says he 's a genius .	and
4	51579	Only the real estate firm could call her .	Her phone rang because she gave her new number only to this .	when
4	27512	The trio of girls in front of us stopped talking .	We got in line .	when
0	50090	Ghleanna ran over to the older dragon .	Threw herself into his open arms .	and
4	40164	Russ gave her a surprisingly boyish grin and said , how about i buy you a cup of coffee .	She looked at him .	when
4	79425	The resort was in full view .	She passed through the place shed originally met tanner .	when
4	133951	`` , you sure hell screamed . '' .	I had to shift to catch you .	when
2	32800	Why connor had brought her .	Suspected it had something to do with her locking him in the dungeon .	but
0	104376	`` the wolf pups hid jaenelle 's shoes .	It took a while to find them .	and
2	93806	They spend most of their time in shock , so it all works in my favour . '' .	I take care of them .	but
4	126675	We parted ways just as the storm clouds were starting to roll in .	It came time for us to get ready for the night .	when
0	141827	Her throat was tight .	She did not dare meet anyone 's eyes .	and
2	62939	Ostensibly to give max room .	Really i was getting away from the weirdness of staring at a dead person i 'd never met .	but
2	35941	Maybe you 've forgotten .	I 'm the one with trace powers .	but
2	143436	We have all known the kind of clergyman who tends to forget his clerical collar after the third glass .	Busby 's habit was the reverse .	but
2	95051	I 'm sorry , chief moses . '' .	She 's too young to be here on her own .	but
0	133987	Besides , i 'm not offering food .	My ability to provide scraps has always been my main redeeming quality to him .	and
2	121642	She was afraid she 'd wake someone with her actions .	They continued to snore .	but
0	36330	Weve got priority one for this one .	Costs are bein covered by stenchstone .	and
0	72095	Now , covered in blood , he finally looked at bones .	Seemed to recognize him .	and
4	126337	Emmes arms and legs were stiff .	She wiggled out from his grasp .	when
4	45141	Your dad hit six foot .	He was in the fifth grade .	when
0	106446	His eyes were fully opened .	He too was almost smiling .	and
2	136276	She tried to wipe them off .	Her vision blurred and she quit trying .	but
2	34764	Most days i feel mad enough to kill every mp within a hundred mile radius .	Hes the leader of our resistance and is all about working toward peace .	but
3	123988	You must ask permission of the austrian government , yes .	You wish to interrogate me because of who my father was .	if
3	70674	What do you care .	Paddy and seamus have the swords .	if
0	149485	He held me by the waist .	Told me to hold on to him .	and
0	95232	They dream , twitching reflexively in their repose , eyelids flickering with subconscious thought .	They are not truly curled within the machine-they are curled into the machine , meshed with it at a hundred points of contact .	and
4	32670	Almost threw a fit .	I came up empty .	when
2	33915	It might be traditional .	She was n't . .	but
4	24710	The brain developed models using the language of mathematics to predict what reality should look like to an all-seeing demon .	The limits of technology are reached .	when
1	5234	Lauren bowers must have thought the same .	She did not reply .	because
0	71998	Rushing to the door , i fumbled my key into the lock , not bothering to close the door behind me .	Ran to my study .	and
0	87407	Exactly what he wanted fair pricing given the extra expense of some imported items , and .	They submitted reasonable tenders .	and
4	46416	Well they seem to be telling us that its a good thing and we have to support all the brave workers , standing up to the state .	I hear about that union .	when
2	80085	I could ask him .	Then i 'm afraid what his answer will be .	but
1	62562	It allowed them to build portions of the computer that spanned the globe .	Ppt transceivers have essentially zero time delay .	because
2	43378	He got up from his desk and it was the music that drew him as he approached the ballroom .	Went downstairs , hearing the clink of glasses and cutlery and the murmur of voices .	but
2	155053	Pirmin knew the constant climbing and gissler had always been light on his feet .	Descending of the alps meandering trails was difficult for someone unaccustomed to them .	but
1	12230	New recruits had arrived .	Their hunters had been dropping like flies .	because
0	17534	The more she swam .	The louder he sang , the weaker she became .	and
2	140205	We knocked on the door .	There was no response .	but
2	143183	It was as tall as a human .	Wore a black hood and cloak .	but
2	17372	He started to leave .	Then looked thoughtfully and turned back to ask , `` are either one of you hungry .	but
2	93636	She concludes he may be a smith .	He is also something more .	but
2	118914	He could think now , and .	He knew what he had to do .	but
3	87581	They would have taken the children .	They were from rhuddlan .	if
2	25744	Oh , all right then , she said , laughing at his face , youve talked me into it .	I want you in a proper suit when we get married .	but
4	95398	Ellie was sitting in the corner of the kitchen .	I got home the next morning .	when
0	147375	We all have enemies .	None of us has a clue what whitney might do next .	and
4	50000	`` , i found this little bastard hiding in the led housing , sucking off our juice . '' .	I peeled that twitchy power circuit open in the head .	when
3	88284	I wondered , but was choosing to ignore it .	Mom suspected something was going on .	if
0	36625	He frowned , scrubbing at them with a corner of his shirt .	Took off his glasses .	and
2	306	There had been rumors of a few people cashing in on some big money options trades placed on the airlines before 9/11 .	The official version was that they had simply been following a trading newsletter that had recommended shorting the airlines .	but
3	10404	I can guess your name .	You want to make this an interactive game .	if
2	110186	He almost spoke with an effort he stopped himself .	The boy 's eyes widened and .	but
1	114021	Which is in plain sight in front of me .	She calmly hands it to me and i explode about all her stuff in the bathroom .	because
2	77022	Why we are being shown the images with anthony and cassandra .	What happened to those that cassandra said are part of the shadows .	but
2	151485	That may be exactly what it is all of the other tapestries point to a specific place .	I had thought of that , and .	but
3	97607	Youll be in very big trouble .	One of the servants catches you inside the governors office .	if
3	37848	He 'd be the guy i 'd talk to , but i was a vault .	I 'd wanted to share .	if
0	115569	Where i do , not far from cresting the tip .	That 's northeast of lake imaq .	and
4	113195	She checked her watch .	Another couple of women came by to chat with him .	when
0	6048	The achings were not very religious , but they started out with the idea that you were alive and not dead .	Tiffany thought she knew how things ought to go .	and
2	156400	Dinosaurs have excellent visual acuity : it 's attuned to movement .	They have a basic amphibian visual system .	but
4	4091	`` you know what , '' julia said , `` , then i will see that you get a replacement set of dishes . '' .	We are all together in the united states and we can wave to each other across the hudson river .	when
0	153387	They had broken through their lines .	Now had nothing between them and the wall of solace other than distance .	and
0	33798	The heat of the day had passed .	The breeze of their passage kept them cool .	and
4	128669	Be careful , boy .	You stare at the lion .	when
2	5407	There are some other things i want you to have as well . '' .	These , along with the jewelry box , are the most special to me .	but
2	141438	Call him crazy or naive .	After a mere five weeks , jackson knew with bone-deep certainty that mia was the woman he was meant to be with .	but
0	153626	Now she knew his taste .	Already hungered for more .	and
0	69713	Their network spanned throughout the world .	Every despicable member was allowed to join for a large monetary donation .	and
2	77346	`` i know '' .	Water is really cold .	but
0	7946	You 're big strong , and .	Your gun will protect you .	and
1	145345	He seemed to know some wrestling holds .	He was doing better close-up .	because
0	78016	To drop by the salon .	See her or jo-jo .	and
0	28187	They had dried themselves .	Put on tunics and mail-shirts .	and
2	49063	I would have denied it .	What was the point .	but
0	23056	The pyramid began to quake .	Then , it silently imploded .	and
2	155083	People are usually wary of him not mia .	Dozer is a big dog , and .	but
1	117881	Now found oddly comforting .	There were so few nash cared .	because
0	94370	Warm , strong hands curled on her upper arms .	Slowly dragged her up .	and
2	141401	`` yeah , you got bethany out .	Katy got caught in the process .	but
1	84707	It takes her a second to look up at me .	She 's still staring at the keys .	because
2	101185	He would be forever a servant of vampires , yes .	Respecting of all living things , and never engage in that which would harm anyone unless somehow that being had fallen beneath the bar of his concern by being an unspeakable monster of some sort .	but
0	119460	Although madame tracy was by many yardsticks quite stupid , she had an instinct in certain matters .	When it came to dabbling in the occult her reasoning was faultless .	and
3	44402	Theyd start at the house at the end of the road and work their way up , and they wouldnt have crossed five zones to get heresince all street officials are based in watford zone .	It was routine thered be fifteen officials .	if
3	59224	You ought to say .	You 're not sure you can make good on this order .	if
2	96343	Some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts above .	A few survived to be rescued .	but
0	9102	We were using .22 blanks in our modified m-4s , cut-outs with infrared and red chem lights where zombie eyes would be .	Had set up some targets .	and
0	21977	It is prospective 11 in character .	Therefore can not affect the creation of the city of mandaue which came into existence on june 21 , 1969 .	and
0	27452	Feeling good , chase shrugged .	Hurried to catch up .	and
3	132117	All my woes will vanish .	I take you for my husband .	if
2	70249	Link wanted to be mad .	Truthfully he was touched that celia had cared enough to help him .	but
2	157116	I was also told that under normal circumstances , it would take six to twelve months to recover immunity .	Now , because of the gvhd , it could take years .	but
1	7346	He chose that end .	The view is so much better .	because
2	80740	Cole stays in order to keep working , getting ready for a meeting .	He sends me home .	but
3	93848	But ... i 'm not sure . '' .	Things can ever be the same .	if
2	14505	His body was still visible , a thin shadow cast along the floor .	He was mostly hidden behind the now open frame .	but
0	62035	For that , i am eternally sorry , you may have my life in payment .	Should you wish it .	and
2	37437	We think we know what happened in broad outline . '' .	There are questions that still have to be answered .	but
3	92470	When he picks you up tonight after your shift then youll know .	He gives you another expensive present .	if
4	153997	It 's a late wednesday evening .	We finally have the chance to spend some time together again , just the two of us with no one demanding our attention or work getting in the way .	when
2	139368	I was wrong to announce your betrothal to jason .	I had so hoped the two of you might suit .	but
0	49581	Does this universe even impinge on the real universe theyd once known .	Can view through the window .	and
0	68827	Soon the dwindling company , following the isen , turned west , and then they turned northwards , and passed over the borders of dunland .	Rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond .	and
2	13341	To be with kerry .	She was too terrified of the person i had become .	but
2	156111	She began to panic and her heart was winning out .	Started shaking her head .	but
2	142201	Him to say something .	He just threw the prescription pills back onto the bed and turned to face me .	but
0	103728	You have asked for an answer : a firm , resounding no .	I have given it .	and
0	96742	The crowd in the square parted at his approach .	There were cheers and some laughter when people saw the broomstick over his shoulder .	and
2	17407	There is a character called professor llort in that game .	This is an exact copy of that game .	but
0	147688	Himself stepping behind her .	Very gently wrapping his arms about her waist .	and
3	19663	But ... emma 's eyes crept back to the glass beads that spelled out eric .	I 'm writing my own , and part of me is tangled up with lizzie .	if
1	110149	It could only have been one of her partners shirts .	The left sleeve was missing .	because
1	130561	I make no sound .	That 's what he conditioned me to do .	because
0	156125	He walked back toward the chalkboard .	Absently gazed at the equations unwritten .	and
0	55320	You just stop buttin ' your nose in . '' .	Keep my steamboats clean of dust .	and
2	94749	His eyes were wide and this wasnt even the pinnacle .	His mouth hung open in amazement .	but
2	14768	I know im complaining that russ let them go .	Thats just being a mother .	but
4	121998	They were both skeptics .	It came to ghosts and the supernatural .	when
2	85198	Hitler gave up on zionism as early as 1935 .	He still staunchly supported the transfer agreement .	but
2	129153	I relented and and to the patio .	Fol owed him out back through the french doors .	but
4	93065	They called the manager to complain about the quality of their staff .	One of the waiters did not understand their english .	when
0	141134	Mama zouzous mouth fell .	She pulled gregory into a warm , tight embrace .	and
0	89792	The subterranean room was chilly .	So was his skin .	and
0	117709	She rolled her eyes .	Gave us a look that said , parents , right .	and
0	135138	It was early april , although the warm days whispered of spring .	The nights were still cold and frosty .	and
2	141242	Paul continued to run , not quite as fast he was into the clearing .	Over his shoulder but .	but
3	53302	Your honor we will not push for an indictment . '' .	We can settle all other issues .	if
2	130082	Francesco let out a fake laugh .	Carl could see right through it .	but
0	9162	Argoth nodded his agreement quickly fell .	Layed down on his pallet .	and
1	24827	Its , helen stated .	Youve been tapping into the vortex at the beach .	because
3	113327	I wondered . '' .	He 'd make an appearance .	if
4	38557	There is none of the carnival raucousness that was the keynote of the cluster fuck at ed 's eats and dawgs .	Tansy leads the willing patrons into the sand bar 's parking lot .	when
4	36394	She stopped in mid stride .	Her eyes fell upon the man she had loved .	when
2	43218	She asked , actually it was more of a demand .	I was ignoring that tone in her voice .	but
1	49836	Id get my ears checked if i were you .	You seem to be having a problem with your hearing .	because
1	97789	We only call it the death grip . '' .	It makes you want to die .	because
2	67547	The lead singer is already shirtless .	The crowd seems to love it .	but
0	24054	Earth colours predominated rich ochre , ecru and yellow interspersed by seams of russet and dun .	Stood starkly against the green backdrop .	and
4	122336	And afterwards , would tell him about the baby .	Everything felt good between them-if it did-she .	when
4	75604	That had plagued him .	He 'd been in iraq .	when
4	149780	Putting up with my grouchiness .	I got stranded on a chapter .	when
2	144181	They were the most powerful of the demons and the most knowledgeable of what was happening down .	There were only a few left within these depths .	but
0	27047	He jingled his money in his pocket handkerchief .	Looked for something small and inexpensive with which to amuse daisy .	and
0	149975	It was only when i was halfway done that i realized the others were exercising their right to talk .	I quickly listened in .	and
1	21453	It was a documentary rerun .	He remembered the day when this had happened , back when they were all living .	because
2	18296	He 'd tried to keep her near him .	The force of the crash had separated them .	but
4	74133	The silence becomes almost deafening .	All lights are turned off leaving starlight to guide your way and only sounds of the original residents to break the ringing in one 's ears .	when
4	65708	Charlotte became so grief-stricken that adams moved the family to the beck homestead in fulton county in 1871 , where they remained for the rest of their lives .	The infant was accidentally run over by his familys coachman and killed .	when
2	113083	It was either be rude or .	Let him think i was a mute .	but
4	88279	When close to the wall and same measurement .	Going between the sheds .	when
4	148474	Megan looked back at stephen .	The sitter had retreated .	when
3	71901	Them open for us .	Rich really did sign them .	if
2	107007	I 'm trying to quit . ' .	I need one for this .	but
0	99846	She closed her eyes , puttering around , fixing things , then seducing her into bed .	Imagined him inside her cabin .	and
2	20045	That she had created to stop it from bleeding .	Before he could pull away she bit his tongue and couldnt even explain the sensation that ran through her as his warm blanketed blood covered her tongue and ran like a river down her throat .	but
2	5137	I initially went along with it .	As he began listening to my heartbeat , i started flirting with him .	but
2	153000	It made a sound like flesh being ripped .	It did not sever the wing .	but
2	65423	Tried to speak he was choked with grief .	He turned and looked at me , and .	but
0	63539	Sit down over there , try not to think about it while you come up .	Drink your beer for a bit .	and
2	93105	I came to handle the transaction .	Your father had a change of heart .	but
2	87262	His plans so far were not going as smoothly as he had hoped .	It was time to take matters in hand .	but
2	103898	Seth went with them and had nothing to say .	Was questioned by female officers .	but
0	10456	I take a quick breath .	Pull my hand back pretending to dig something out of my purse .	and
3	6073	And , how can i tell her no .	She wont tell me .	if
2	34621	Well , it 's definitely an interface , and it 's equally useful in other respects .	It compensates for signal loss due to distance .	but
2	115388	He tried to pull his hands .	She would not let go .	but
4	95700	The person who was seated got up .	The chair stopped and looked at aidan with a vague expression drawn on his face .	when
0	150354	The end to the princes reign came .	Suddenly both killing the other by thrusting swords through defenses no longer capable of thwarting attack .	and
0	66887	Picking the cane up , sin turned so quickly that kat had to practically run to catch up to him .	Headed back for the elevators .	and
2	72748	Victoria was still out .	Miss colton needed him .	but
1	48291	To get tight as hell .	Everywhere the cdc is picking us as the lead supplier of the vaccine and well have all kinds of three letter agencies crawling up our asses .	because
0	26313	Dad came and mom came with three cups of hot coffee .	Sat first next to me .	and
0	81842	You can make it red .	Promise me an exclusive , i can cut out a closet for you .	and
3	150805	She might have weighed her reply , thought it over , but sometime tonight shed stopped hiding from this man .	She wasnt so exhausted .	if
0	37092	I 'm already dead .	So are all the others .	and
3	110666	`` , i 'd go left . '' .	You 're trying to avoid him .	if
0	114761	Their pursuer let loose a howling wail .	She fought the urge to let go and cover her ears .	and
2	40669	I certainly made it worse with my own stupidity .	It would have happened .	but
2	157977	A shard of the glass nicked her knuckle .	Her emotions had gotten the best of her , and she hadnt yet registered the pain .	but
2	80344	I had not known if we were being rescued by our allies or our enemies .	My heart was telling me in that moment that i was in the presence of the latter .	but
2	44801	He felt bad about killing him .	He knew that as long as ironclaw lived , james and the others would never be safe .	but
1	82272	Things have been uneasy between us .	Mostly you cant see what i see .	because
0	89710	The moon washes her pale as paper .	I marvel at the fact she looks like a marble version of herself .	and
0	125637	Procuring light clouds of smoke .	Creating a pungent aroma at the same time .	and
4	111689	Henry says , `` stop sulking .	They turn right off highway 93 onto norway valley road .	when
4	31139	He leapt forward , tucked his body in and rolled past vijera .	Aki made the opening .	when
1	117853	I was only half listening .	I had bigger problems .	because
4	67220	I could hand the dress down to my own daughter .	She gets old enough to get married .	when
0	58419	But they 're not coming in the same order as last time ... '' noticing kaladin .	Some are new , so perhaps there is something to learn we have not yet discovered .	and
0	28807	Leaving adrian and the animal to guard their dead , jimhad returned to the hotel , packed up all their shit .	Loaded it into his truck .	and
1	75242	I had a feeling they let him hang with them .	He put up with their abuse , hungry to belong .	because
3	92133	Then one dies , and two will help me . ' .	You decide to keep her .	if
2	14280	He was a good man .	His ways were old fashion .	but
1	20636	He thought he would never , never ever be able to be with her .	She was a young lady of quality and he was a slave .	because
0	23502	Without further wait , the kry-santhian slipped behind a swivel mounted device tediously squeezed its trigger .	Pivoted it towards some nearby buildings .	and
2	19537	Maybe it was the stress of holding it together for .	Suddenly , tears were streaming down her face fast and furious .	but
0	149623	Tom veal was married there a week before he was killed .	He married claudia , not abatha pary .	and
0	21950	You 're more than a seal .	They think that , who knows who else does .	and
2	152096	I might be a pixy .	I know enough magic to know that you used her hair .	but
3	52648	You havent been paying attention .	You dont think business is political .	if
2	56886	Checking all of these towns will take more time .	We have no choice .	but
0	61118	Sandra had seemed insistent that we stay to dinner .	Her husband had been quietly miserable .	and
0	124148	De brosse grins sheepishly , and then toward the charbonnerie women .	Bows an apology first in my direction .	and
3	151418	Then he must also be behind duval 's poisoning .	All of that is true .	if
2	95551	I knew facial hair was the thing in energo .	Monty would always look funny to me with a beard .	but
2	82037	Senator freeman is coming here and he mentioned you .	Wants to talk to all the women .	but
1	150821	I 'd rather you leave me .	I cut off the tour than have you stay with me and be out on tour and not be safe .	because
4	95225	`` he will have you executed ! '' .	The real prince is located .	when
3	124097	I could use another pillow . '' .	It 's not too much trouble .	if
4	59365	Pesh refused to read whether she had been .	The autopsy had come .	when
0	130288	Jared grabbed the cloth over jaden 's left shoulder .	Clenched it into a tight fist .	and
4	52604	And now her first unguarded response was to smile .	She glanced up from the drink she was concocting .	when
0	149186	He had apparently gotten the weaker of the two fighters .	Finished her only shortly after joyah .	and
3	127149	You could almost imagine they had once moved .	You looked at them a certain way .	if
0	152289	Her body uncurled to accommodate his .	He rolled mostly on top of her .	and
3	141942	I would have expected the punch line .	Mei was the joking type .	if
2	44022	I could be wrong .	The sun shined a bit brighter and the sky had a stunning blue that i had never seen before .	but
3	96822	And perhaps that remained a factor in her painting .	Even her new occupation gave her a more plausible motive .	if
2	27393	The front door was past the kitchen .	The back door was just as close to the stairs .	but
3	42253	Then he could help them both .	He could somehow get through to shea .	if
3	155967	I must overcome those shortcomings . '' .	I am to be a god .	if
1	144154	Wherever they came from , whatever their story , this was the end of the line for them and they knew it .	Here they were no longer needed .	because
0	63278	He was feeling uncomfortable under the doctors eager stare .	He shrank back into his seat .	and
0	46400	He turned back to howie .	Ordered , get it from him .	and
4	36054	He had also left a small ebony and cedar box braced with silver chasing and topped with semi-precious jewels in which to house them .	The bishop of dijon had left the bones of saint hugh .	when
2	55005	No , i did not do it .	It bothers me at first that i can not get some privacy when i find that i can only close the door and not lock it .	but
0	47462	Cutwell shut the door behind them .	Fumbled for a candlestick .	and
3	10707	They 'll be invulnerable and probably undetectable .	They 're at high altitude .	if
1	137841	Logan was her arsonist .	This moment would make his crime so much more satisfying .	because
4	103944	Just finished swallowing some cold capsules .	A knock on her front door sounded out through the apartment .	when
2	85545	In the end they could think of no one who could talk shop like shep , and even if eisenhower did not know the in 's and out 's of road construction , he was eisenhower , and .	The man was keen as a hawk .	but
4	157981	`` ' she said slowly , `` they had , like , one rack of makeup .	I was inside the gas station .	when
3	83400	To live another life .	I can do what im supposed to do with this one .	if
3	7223	Make the hunt exciting for his dad , the outcome would be even worse .	He didnt play the game .	if
0	6818	He put up his hands in surrender stood just a couple of feet away from her .	Came around the desk .	and
3	141654	She 'd come off and attack the goddess .	She were still on his skin when artemis began beating him .	if
2	101085	I was barely a man .	I felt more like some kind of god .	but
0	156160	The evening meal was plain but nourishing .	Long did they stay up round the fire as the man told many a tale and asked after the womans own sad story .	and
0	136111	At night it cries those dark , oily tears .	They 're rusting the hell out of his fine stratham headlight .	and
4	107356	I was nearly to the end .	I spotted a crumpled fast food bag lodged in a tuft of weeds .	when
2	2864	Few know about them , and those few are generally welcome .	Fewer would actually take the opportunity to enter one .	but
4	5048	The situation finally achieved critical madness earlier this week .	One of the twins apparently attempted to hemlock the others wine in a poorly planned betrayal .	when
2	22271	He knew , vaguely , how long it would take to make that journey via the main roads .	They werent taking the main roads because those were sure to be patrolled by soldiers of the empire .	but
2	55161	My words came out in a rage .	I felt the burning of curiosity at what he might say .	but
2	38861	Gel tried to protect himself there was nothing gel could do as the mans sword swung inwards towards his head .	Tried to grab the sword , to do anything .	but
3	133967	I was wondering . '' .	You 'd look at it with me .	if
4	46260	You need to know where to look .	You are in front of an audience .	when
3	155761	We used the nice van .	It was a nice neighborhood .	if
3	21661	Portents about sorrow would draw out the suffering .	I couldnt avoid the tragedy .	if
2	33247	To the people , the assassin must be a kind of magic they did not understand , he said .	That , like all magic , it was reality bent to the will of the assassin .	but
0	55268	He ran toward it .	I tugged at him to put me down .	and
0	2218	During some game the men were playing , along with a few others .	Had stripped off his wet shirt-which she had kindly offered to take into the laundry room .	and
0	26527	He was outside the camp walls .	So resolved that he had not endured such hell only to fall here , to succumb to the unholy might of this cursed nazi-thing .	and
0	120595	The police had searched their pockets .	Found a metro map and specific instructions to rachaels apartment .	and
4	57953	He bumped into her .	He lurched forward to snag his bag before it drifted out of reach .	when
2	142227	He said warmly ; this was not a casual chat , he was making it clear .	I noticed that he was sitting behind his desk , putting a distance between us which , considering dons way of thinking , meant to signify his intentions .	but
0	33471	Who would find it very hard when he was married .	Couldnt please himself where women were concerned .	and
0	91336	He hooked a thumb in the waistband of his kilt .	Scowled then shifted on his feet .	and
0	89237	She drew in a breath .	Stared at him in horror and surprise .	and
2	16984	She was such a mystery .	He was betting everything on the possibility that she was sick of the life in manhattan .	but
2	48389	Yes , they have material luxury .	They dont have integrity , love or peace .	but
2	38898	Can not help relish where i am .	I relax in a chair , my bare feet on the bed , and .	but
0	129619	Fever and chills assaulted him in turn .	Late he had developed a persistent racking cough .	and
2	103095	It hurts its true .	Its hard to hear , and .	but
0	153290	Maybe we could stand in a line with hot-air blowers down the centre of the town for three months every year .	Stop the underground ice from forming .	and
3	113159	To get someone 's attention .	It hit her in the head .	if
0	160360	Unfortunately , she actually liked his brothers .	They , in turn , seemed to adore her .	and
1	67160	I force a smile .	That thought makes me grumpy .	because
3	126123	Shed be saying goodbye .	Sara didnt marry him .	if
0	3857	Who stood in the corner of the abandoned store .	Was peering out the window onto the street .	and
0	156797	He was holding a spear .	Twisting it into shadow 's guts .	and
2	131198	The strain in her head caused her knees to buckle .	Lucian held her with an unnatural strength .	but
3	121349	He 'd be the last person to tell her .	There was something she could have done .	if
0	96492	Chandar and tara returned .	Withdrew into the flar that became suspiciously quiet except for a few suppressed giggles that escaped .	and
2	53630	I have a momma .	She 's in the bathroom .	but
3	123483	They were acting in defense of themselves and the earth . '' .	They struck out at us in a rage .	if
4	127611	A girl , who was hoping to be second time lucky with a man , must have felt extreme disappointment and even anger .	She was rejected a second time .	when
0	42669	I had to do the work late at night .	They only allow us one candle in the attic , so it 's hardly my finest accomplishment as a seamstress .	and
2	18302	Nothing should have been able to live up to the languorous feasting he 'd envisioned .	This not only lived up , it surpassed .	but
2	67336	This is something different and new for you .	I think that is for you to decide .	but
0	115705	Yet it was the voice , and .	The voice said , `` cyril , come home .	and
2	98997	Eddy was no help .	Gil might have picked up a rumor or two .	but
2	123067	There was some grumbling from nelson .	Hendrix and vaughan shuffled him out and we were left , just the girls .	but
0	16085	In the long run they could not be .	There was a good possibility that he would end up hurting her , no matter what chris believed .	and
0	158642	He put the jacket in the backseat .	Got behind the wheel .	and
2	105060	I searched the whole house .	All i kept finding were piles and piles of leaves .	but
0	106871	She knew what she wanted .	Was going to take it no matter what .	and
2	16400	In previous administrations , three captains and the commissioner made up the trial board .	Under curtis 's regime , curtis himself was the sole judge .	but
3	3793	*** why had he asked her .	She regretted the night together in hawaii .	if
0	129385	I touched her face .	She closed her eyes .	and
3	102329	A fisherman as graham northerland .	Only i could inveigle him to take me along one day .	if
0	2773	`` nor you , death god , '' barinthus said .	There was an edge of irritation to his voice .	and
0	10577	Everything was perfect , colin .	Sibyl were both direct descendants ( of this marian was certain intuitively rather than with any real knowledge .	and
1	42353	There was something to eat in the kitchen pantry .	She was in the mood for a late night snack .	because
0	32459	She didnt say anything back , but she had one of those i gotcha right where i want you mona-lisa smiles on her face that they all get .	I caught her reflection in a door as she entered the hotel lobby .	and
4	346	That was , and otto had talked me out of it by telling me i had to keep turning the pages .	I had decided i would commit suicide .	when
4	30592	Right , now 's .	You recommend me that i should see a good psychiatrist .	when
4	143228	He was waiting in the bedroom , and the rest of the house was dark .	She left the bath .	when
0	23243	He now sat on the edge of the bed staring at me .	I truly wanted to return to him .	and
3	148176	Cronus would have never saved her .	Even you 'd been by his side and fulfilled your promises to him .	if
2	91191	Im going to keep thinking about this stuff .	I dont want you to burden yourself by any of it , okay .	but
2	128106	Over the course of his trip to the water , he had worked some life back into his arms and legs .	They were still weak and tingling as if half-asleep .	but
0	91898	My dad had been hired by a large engineering corporation .	Wanted to find a place closer to his work .	and
2	82349	I lifted my arms to wrap around him .	Found an iv in my left arm .	but
3	106692	You start giving me real answers .	What i decide to stay here ? '' .	if
2	36538	I love your wife dearly . ' .	Having her along is going to be inconvenient .	but
0	88163	It felt absurdly normal .	Despite everything , it was nice to pretend that things werent completely messed up some part of gregory hated the thought it might end .	and
4	123408	Beth recalled their first conversation .	She was in india .	when
2	41939	A week before the fight , the kid came in kinda banged up .	His parents told my dad hed been sparring with some buddies .	but
2	140265	I could feel the warmth of her thighs .	Now it was nothing special to me .	but
0	155012	He had the winchester across that knee .	With his other hand he held the bridle of his horse .	and
2	38403	We 're all separate organisms .	We all share an overall consciousness .	but
4	97066	I had my hand on you .	Your heart quit beating .	when
2	6505	`` so is nicholas barlow . '' .	You never seem to be concerned about him .	but
3	68870	Shed responded to lauras inquiry .	She should call 911 with a simple facttheyll take him to the hospital .	if
1	140774	I wanted to blame someone , someone other than me .	The pain and regret were too much .	because
0	25540	She noticed alice standing next to her on the right .	Shot her a frantic look .	and
2	120588	It was not easy .	I was getting better reading into the shadow of other peoples emotions through strict , focused concentration .	but
2	150407	Well , ill consider it , she said , after a few moments , confirming that they consider it legal-with-restrictions , including a strict demonstration that the system id be using satisfies the requirements of article and clause whatever-they-were .	I would want an official document from the local holy order of police .	but
2	151290	`` alright , i think you 're crazy . '' .	I 'm coming straight over .	but
3	87576	She had no idea the tirade he planned to unleash on her .	She walked out of this warehouse alive .	if
0	131320	They attached two chains to the wide collar .	Kept his hands tied behind his back .	and
2	29151	Each of them had a nemesis .	Holly didnt know about hers and gia wasnt ready to meet tiffany head on .	but
0	49937	He saw the dais where the lord was meant to sit with his children and wife .	He noticed that there was a raised seat for the lord of the castle 's spirit animal to rest on .	and
4	115364	Reminding me of the old temple .	It had crumbled to dust before my eyes .	when
2	123523	Murdering demons i didnt understand .	A storm , at least , i knew .	but
4	101492	Axel just looked blank .	He saw these men .	when
3	17483	It 's mighty peculiar . '' .	You want my honest opinion .	if
0	152820	They turned at a corner again at the next , and .	Rode slowly through a crowd of women at a .	and
0	159580	Colonel b. patterson apologized profusely to the president for the interruption , opened the door asked professor derek martin to wait outside a few minutes more .	Put down the phone on the desk .	and
2	46655	He might not be able to buy them all the things he would like for them to have .	He could at least provide a decent place for them to live , and good food to put on the table .	but
2	130829	Our attempts at this dying will succeed only if we men share in god 's dying , just as our thinking can succeed only because it is a drop out of the ocean of his intelligence : ; and he can not die except by being a man .	We can not share god 's dying unless god dies .	but
0	138555	Occasional telephone calls and e-mails kept us in contact .	We 'd gone our separate directions with no bad blood between us .	and
4	19974	Before i was worried , but not to this extent .	I thought it was mostly me that was in trouble and after i told eric and dahlia to get out of l.a. .	when
2	134007	Jesse 's arms still held me to him .	His body started to quiver .	but
0	94444	Jude grabbed the flowers tossed the roses onto the pavement .	Jerked out the card .	and
4	145451	At last i slithered out to have a look .	The fire seemed to be dying down .	when
2	159599	Not to overpower lou during the exchange .	If i know salvi , i 'm sure he 'll have a few men close by , just in case .	but
3	112511	Wel i need to go into work for a bit .	You 're quite finished being amazed .	if
2	38068	Angie looked where elma was pointing .	Then turned her stare back down to the road .	but
0	94058	`` they asked so much of you .	What do you have in return .	and
0	106077	To adjust his strategies .	Replenish his weakened powers .	and
0	123336	Then , beneath all of that , there is a gap , and .	Then the names begin .	and
3	41178	Please take a few minutes to submit a review wherever you purchased the book .	You enjoyed doubt ( book 1 of the among us trilogy .	if
0	82940	The eons , as eons must , plodded on toward an uncertain future , and .	The younger gods grew older , and the cycle of their ascendancy neared its conclusion .	and
0	42036	Claire pulled her jacket in tighter .	Huddled against the wind as they reached the ridge .	and
2	145493	He was an alcoholic and he didnt deserve to die like thisno one does .	He was still a human being .	but
2	89440	As hermione had said , his color was poor .	His eyes focused on arabella with a reassuring sizzle .	but
0	42446	Pulling her knife from the target board .	Turning the blade towards mikhail .	and
0	70740	Manning up dealing with things myself - instead of killing salina myself .	Onto her shoulders instead of .	and
2	64378	He had arranged an escort to take her to the perfeddwlad .	She , as shed sworn , refused to leave unless olwen could leave .	but
0	24617	Of course they scrubbed me .	They took to paddling me .	and
2	93946	Bardoc was unhappy about this misunderstanding with those stupid guards who were protecting landens .	She could talk him .	but
2	6997	Several times , the tunnel split off in different directions .	Ash always chose a path without hesitation .	but
1	6694	I was going to have to really watch him .	He made it look like he was one of the most racially neutral people in town and no one would believe me .	because
4	62897	Birthdays were among the few rare occasions .	She could really shine .	when
2	143	`` we 're out of sight .	Keeping an eye on things .	but
1	139643	Will stopped , and stood inches from lokis face .	I dont think you realize what we are up against .	because
4	108077	It reminded her of the recent evening .	Kaelah and muera had argued and she wondered if there had been a favorite for kaelah .	when
3	85520	I would have no chance .	They ganged up on me .	if
4	80358	She stood up , raised her arms and closed her eyes .	There were no more supplicants .	when
0	31815	The house needed work and the garden needed to be tended there were good books .	I was going to travel , i really was , but ... '' she made big eyes at him .	and
2	115141	It 's supposed to sleep .	It does n't . .	but
0	68946	She swiped her hand through her daughter 's .	Told her to run as fast as she could .	and
2	142559	I 've worked a long time to get where i am in my work . '' .	There might not be any way i can stay here and still do my research .	but
3	39928	I would have buckled , so i stormed out of the room and past henry , who wordlessly followed me to my suite .	She 'd looked at me .	if
2	95441	She wore in the hot tub .	The top of this one was strapless .	but
0	125105	Sailors and dockworkers were rushing .	Completing the last minute preparations before setting out .	and

2	97320	She clutched her stomach tighter and tighter , waiting for the surge to make its exit and take the pain with it just as .	In this occasion , a new feeling came and it coursed through her stomach , heart , hands , arms , and her every other centimeter of her body until it arrived at her eyes .	but
2	52060	They covered a huge swath of the atlantic from the caribbean into the south atlantic , and .	They communicated with each other by shortwave radio and direct satellite transponders that could be detected from orbit .	but
2	67831	Greta was heartbroken to give you up .	It 's the valkyrie way to relinquish human offspring .	but
0	105829	He has grown steady , these last few months ; ; and mr. shipley .	At least that will mean one decent hand in the log-book .	and
2	125645	Her sister died when she was young .	I read somewhere that she was more beautiful .	but
3	672	It 'll take time to kill us all , and there 's always a chance we 'll kill him before he gets us all .	He blames all the men you brought with you and has to kill them all , plus me .	if

0	152755	Bhelliom 's speech , emerging from kalten 's lips , had been dry unemotional , but .	This time the voice was also exultant .	and
3	74758	He 's got to know plenty about gaines .	He lived here his whole life .	if

1	55406	You have the assurance you 've made it past the event .	That juncture in time has already seen and dismissed you .	because
1	13891	Or maybe it was .	She was the one person whose thoughts were closed to me , a mystery i longed to solve .	because
4	149694	You moved heaven and earth to find him .	You found out dex existed .	when
3	50164	The book can not leave the lighthouse .	So you want to read it .	if
2	136747	He might not have been my first lover .	He had been the first man to ever spend the night with me .	but
0	5157	I dislodged the hammer .	Swung it at a tall , skinny zombie woman who was missing half of her face .	and
4	20481	Even chased one reporter out with a butcher knife .	He referred to mary peg as a bastard pirate child .	when
2	52293	Oh shit its a burglar .	Then birth licked his lips and looked at josh .	but
2	138962	I should be in .	I need to talk to you .	but
2	91488	Excuse me , the space chicken excused .	You look like a man wizened to the ways of the water .	but
4	37926	She turned to ronnie and said okay .	The flow of characters ceased and she closed her palm .	when
2	152780	Grace knew chris was right .	She didnt have to like it .	but
0	109957	~ mike pulled the trucks off the pavement .	Headed towards the tree line about three hundred yards behind the dealership they had chosen .	and
2	63971	It 's taken me three years .	I 'm going to be okay .	but
3	8620	Okay said her mother .	You wrap up warm .	if
1	109662	She was often the first one to literally run to the aid of other classmates when the school bully was starting to pick on someone .	Alex was a mostly fearless and less feminine type ( what some call a ' tomboy ' .	because

2	19155	Then it would start leaking - slowly at first , arcing to ground in little bursts .	Then building up to a great discharge of occult potentiality .	but
0	131482	His brow was split .	Blood trickled down his face , dripping onto his shirt .	and
0	4671	I do , answered brenda debbie then removed a ring from the base of the rubber phallus .	Transferred it to the base of the real thing .	and
2	18452	I 'm leaving open the possibility that she can see other guys .	I 'm not fond of her discussing .	but
2	26037	I can supposedly make things happen by sheer force of will .	I 've never tried it .	but
1	141089	I was referring to danger .	Smithson is in san francisco and im watching him .	because
0	41893	The translator 's lenses were pried free from my fingers .	Sucked across the room .	and
2	18931	How he had , at first he found only love and peace radiating from the faces .	Thought they looked as if they had been drawn to convey anger .	but
1	55447	She 'd had to use this tactic .	Alexei was almost always studying whenever she saw him .	because

3	118877	To hold her head high and walk into the tests .	Even she was taking them for ulterior motives .	if
2	42328	Daric had never known his mother .	He knew she must have been an extraordinary woman for his father to have descended into madness from losing her .	but
2	114453	I 'm not usually one to stereotype .	He gave me the creeps like he was straight out of a horror movie .	but

2	51163	She scrambled up the stairs , banged her knee , and slid two steps .	Tripped over a muddy pair of mike 's lacrosse cleats .	but
0	32137	The two young men naturally turned their earnest gaze in the direction of the window , which we have before remarked was one unprovided with shutters .	There , to their intense surprise , they saw , slowly rising up from the lower part of it , what appeared to be a human form .	and
2	20407	His breathing was ragged .	There was no wheezing or coughing like she assumed thered be if his lung was punctured .	but

4	54369	To find way to known safe location .	Dropped into extreme or harsh environment .	when
1	18172	What bothered me most .	Those things could be explained away after last night .	because
0	10476	I stood over her .	Felt more of that awful coldness .	and
3	157153	What would the l.a. gossip rags say .	They knew what was going on .	if
3	23969	I 'd say i had it .	Tim duncan was the worst thing i had to worry .	if
0	135326	Murrdyd turned on her .	Told my clansmen to seize her .	and

2	109941	This was all a hoax .	Finally her calls paid .	but
2	160775	Her mother tries unsuccessfully to prevent an outburst .	The child is adamant about whatever it was that she wants .	but
0	28401	Instead stooped down resting on her hands and knees lowered her head until she felt the blood coming back and flowing through her body and reaching calmness .	She closed the door , fully out of breath and had a feeling as if she was going to faint , but .	and

2	37354	She tried to speak to him , to help him .	She could only curl and shudder and make helpless grunting sounds .	but
0	94236	We were heading down a possible wrong track .	Really should be applying some brakes before we got .	and
3	42902	Then i think we cud get there by the time the sun sets the day after the morrow .	We sail all night .	if
2	9404	I have never been like this before .	I have nowhere to go , nothing to fall back on except for here , and here is throwing me into the abyss please i whisper .	but
0	132212	Owen stared over his shoulder at finn and roslyn .	They all exchanged grim looks .	and
0	98030	The others hurried over .	We all peered at the blossoms growing out of the rock wall .	and
4	74083	A sharp sting ignites over me .	He asks the question .	when

0	87175	She nodded stood up .	Marika 's face paled , but .	and
4	114463	To head towards the welcoming light of the hangar .	A low wail sounded out into the oppressive silence from the other direction .	when

1	100986	Have the chance to work it out .	Jahja pulled joanna against his chest and shoved the barrel of the pistol against her temple .	because
0	5963	Barely thinking , he unhooked the lamp from the doorpost .	Turned to survey the task .	and
2	98181	I hoped the bullet he 'd just taken to the skull had been painful .	He probably never knew what hit him .	but
2	155814	There were countless scents in the air .	I was able to effortlessly detect an anomaly .	but
4	155933	The maags of the seagull have a certain amount of awe in their voices .	They tell other maags about you .	when
3	65569	She 'd advise the wrestling team . '' .	It came with a free hotel room once a month .	if
3	155726	It is full price .	You want this blouse .	if
0	1389	His thought was intercepted .	Relayed back to him as if by the speed of light .	and
0	117434	When the canyons gave way to a few scraggly thickets of trees .	They wound about in them for a span before coming to a massive ledge beyond .	and
2	94663	When jennifer brought joshua home from the hospital , she was given a long list of instructions .	They only served to panic her .	but
0	30305	His blue eyes locked onto the shadow fangs owners .	He knew the danger he faced .	and
2	156386	My muscles were aching from the high kicks at rehearsal , and the excitement was bubbling in my veins .	I was going to be popping ibuprofen like candy .	but
2	144536	Neil always felt uneasy when the computer reported for him .	He thanked the computer and then asked it to call the director .	but
2	117842	The startled squeak from victoria 's maid at the back of the cabriolet drew her attention .	Phillip stopped victoria from turning back to see to her with a gentle hand at her cheek .	but
4	80678	We also take the last bed in the hotel bed , as in one .	We take the last room in the hotel .	when
2	77474	I try the drawer .	It is definitely locked .	but
2	87258	They were nothing trash in need of disposing of , and .	Their deaths fit charles plans to be elected the next mayor .	but
4	11684	In that stupid high-pitch voice he does use .	He pretending to be joking but he really serious .	when
0	150478	A lamp on a round end table stood beside it .	Lit up the area in a dim glow .	and
2	52440	He started to turn away .	Michael grabbed him by the shoulder , suddenly filled with alarm .	but
0	43066	Ahmad had passed directly in front of her .	A disturbing image flashed into her mind of ahmad trying to hit her as he ran past , only missing because she had squatted to the floor .	and
2	59473	The glasses were almost a foot tall , and .	The drinking straws added another six inches , and ellie 's chin was about level with the table top , so her mouth was a long way from where it needed to be .	but
2	83297	More determined to get out of here alive .	Taking one or two of the vampirs to hell .	but

2	127568	One might conclude that it is a fickle , unjust universe .	That 's simply the wrong thinking feeding on itself .	but
0	37238	He gripped the gun in both hands .	Fired twice in rapid succession .	and

0	109372	Tonight i 'll share one last meal with my family .	Tell them i love them .	and
0	104474	Its headlights snapped off .	The vehicle coasted to a stop at the end of the cul-de-sac , blocking the entrance to caine 's driveway .	and
4	131104	We had a little over an hour drive ahead of us .	We checked out of the hotel and headed to the california institute for women , in corona , where emma ricks would be waiting to talk to us .	when
4	45456	That she 'd see .	They reached the lowest levels-engineering .	when
2	137117	She took calyss hand and .	Gave her a smile .	but
2	71673	The first shout of warning went up .	Richard was already grabbing daniel 's arm and throwing himself to the side , out of the way of the oncoming vehicle .	but
0	13607	I repeated the words .	The pain in my fingers grew stronger .	and
2	69434	Bass scarcely paid any attention when the dust-covered cowboy strode in the door .	When the man glanced around to locate him and then started directly toward his table , the marshal sat up in his chair and casually brushed his right coattail back to expose the handle of his revolver .	but
2	122384	It was hidden amongst some of the glowing decorations .	She was well-practiced in locating and disabling surveillance equipment , and within a few minutes she had it rewired to show another nearby room .	but
1	84297	Horrified of what he must think i shook my head .	He 'd nailed it right on the head .	because
2	119709	He had a scrunched weasel face .	His chin and jaw were well rounded so it created the illusion that he was handsome .	but
2	99687	Maybe grimdin would have something to share .	When steven looked , the dwarfs bed was empty .	but
0	150272	The staffs change room to shower .	Get into their new clothes .	and
0	154820	The machine spat out .	Stashed it in my pocket .	and
0	136579	Many italian carcano rifles fired .	Three of those shots sounded like a carcano coming from the left of the cameraman .	and
4	36081	Even her skin was cool to the touch .	He pressed his cheek against it .	when
3	109833	Wed all like to get a move on .	You two are done .	if
1	103147	Thats even more perfect .	The chief wanted some minority cops for this one .	because
4	10345	Jason was the first to speak .	The waitress returned to take their orders .	when
4	102704	`` can you tell me again ? '' .	I 'm not on pain medicine .	when
0	127593	To fill in the gaps .	To repeat her myth .	and
2	89797	She got up and .	Blinked the black spots from her eyes .	but
1	126609	But having my father 's approval was important to me . '' .	He is my father .	because
4	129523	He was about to peek over the edge .	A cowboy hat rose up before him .	when
2	127151	She might not know much about him , as she 'd told him earlier .	She did know that .	but
4	90896	Chapter fifteen leah woke up .	The sun rudely broke into her room through the window .	when
3	5709	It much easier to protect her .	She goes about her life as normal .	if
0	115881	When she came out onto the sidewalk .	Headed for the bus stop .	and
3	69508	It would be nice .	We shared the credit .	if
0	27773	She only heard the rising crescendo of song saw the spreading canvas of colour .	Claires nose tingled with the cold and her cheeks burned , but .	and
0	51328	His expression was one of arrogance .	She got the impression that that was an unconscious default , not anything to do with her .	and
2	101044	She knew they had no future .	She still worried he would walk away when he learned who she was .	but
3	149759	My demise could be explained as medical errors .	Death by natural causes doesnt fly .	if
0	45265	They are like babies .	Soak up whatever affection you can give them .	and
0	5336	His felt warm and hard .	I was glad to be holding on to him .	and
4	77404	I was at my shithole apartment in the center of town , and about halfway through a handle of cheap whiskey .	My brother walked in without knocking .	when
1	45486	`` that 's . '' .	I 'm letting you .	because
4	44712	It is a cheap fix . '' .	You are too broke to afford the good stuff .	when
0	6236	A rhythmic cry began to form .	They lifted their voices higher and higher .	and
3	96713	As big as jack was , he 'd be no match for babe 's strength .	He decided to push him aside and tear that mousy hair off his friend 's head .	if
4	88974	I shook my head .	He kept his grip tight around me .	when
2	152903	His heart dropped as he realized the sheep had not only fled .	Had chosen , of all places , to head west , to darkwood .	but
1	147336	The old mans eyes didnt look at anything particular .	His mind had taken over .	because
2	120085	I thought it was justified .	Now , i 'm afraid it was all for nothing .	but
0	128214	But before he departed , whillem quickly measured hamish .	Confirmed that the clothes madam eloise had ordered and already taken delivery of were going to fit him .	and
0	133843	Consequently , he stood his full height in front of the wretched man .	Did just as ravan taught him to do .	and
2	155184	He knew sheiva was right , he knew he must not think of chaeli as obtainable .	He couldnt help it .	but
0	143312	Aviendha heaved herself to her feet , moving up a nearby incline .	Ran away from the trollocs .	and
4	43072	Yet , she shook her head and whistled .	She thought of last night .	when
4	114605	To visit him since last christmas .	Herr armansky stopped by .	when
3	83369	You 're a pretty nice boss .	You 're willing to take care of all my hospital bills .	if
3	109899	Mirror and reflections are never good signs .	I remember my interpretations of dreams .	if
0	120504	The doorway closed behind her .	That was when it ended .	and
3	127138	`` bring it . '' .	They dare , which i doubt .	if
4	54060	She had been working for about three hours , building up arguments for an upcoming negotiation with a husband/wife team who were busy dividing up their assets .	Jim walked into her office and dropped a huge stack of papers onto her desk .	when
2	123242	Thus , teresa guccioli was not so very different from many of her countrymen and women .	She had a brash way of expressing it .	but
3	114185	It would be them caught by their ears right then and .	Peter kept it up .	if
0	85936	In the form of a rose , i will attend your wedding .	As the air , i will attend you at the birth of your children .	and
0	86578	But it 's a hollow day .	Even all i start daydreaming about food .	and
0	100141	He glanced at me , lifted his brows in question .	Probably saw the shock on my face .	and
2	23775	Ghostwalker missions were kept strictly secret .	She knew sergeant major griffen , and could have gone to him to get word to them had she wanted .	but
0	89780	She had caught his arm pinched his cheek .	Looked into his eyes .	and
4	12943	They were coming off of a windy road , and approaching a traffic jam on a highway .	She found the courage to open her eyes .	when
4	6969	Tori gave away his intentions .	His gaze darted to riddicks stomach for a fraction of a second .	when
0	93581	Burning through him leaving only the desire .	Scorching everything in its path .	and
2	28221	It wouldnt be easy .	Allah would guide him .	but
0	56777	A sticky droplet clung to her lips .	It took all graham 's self-control to keep from going over the table and licking it from her .	and
2	14385	He wanted to study computer science .	He had more skill already than the technicians employed by the school , and was often called in to give a helping hand when there was a problem .	but
2	122661	Chapter thirty-eight the dwarves had attached a glass jar full of phosphorescent fungus to the front of the apparatus .	As justin kicked farther and farther into the cold darkness of the lake , its glow had nothing to catch on save the occasional fish or drifting piece of plant .	but
4	55751	Hell , you 'll be looking at them .	We brief up your team for your drop .	when
0	86451	You agreed to do a favor for your niece .	Frighten a kid she 's been fighting with at school .	and
2	15246	Not only have i been an old maid in training since my eighteenth birthday .	I 'm driving the bandwagon for future old maids of america .	but
4	94056	You were running and i just wanted to help .	I first met you .	when
3	132176	She wouldnt want him to ask .	Their positions were reversed .	if
2	55516	I 'd gone with my gut .	I had wondered many times if he could be trusted .	but
2	153104	Yes , emma might be able to clobber him like a heavyweight boxer .	Hed just shrug it off .	but
2	119112	I tried to be calm , to preserve jared 's feelings .	Ryan was just a few feet .	but
3	21104	He 'd know for sure that she had lost it , and he 'd check her into a psych house .	He could hear the thoughts running through her head .	if
4	116683	Ari gulped at the thought of rafe 's reaction .	He saw pictures of that kind .	when
2	157349	Roshan knew frank di giorgio had been connected to one of the crime families in italy when he was a young man .	That had been a long time .	but
2	149506	His father tried to say more .	Was quick to follow .	but
2	105743	I noticed troy give another tilt of his chin .	It was lost to the much more impressive sensory stimuli breaking through my limp shell .	but
2	6343	Mario vanished through the crowd .	In seconds he was back , his eyes now on spencer .	but
4	90242	Wouldnt give it back and hit her on the head with a baseball bat .	She tried taking it .	when
1	116685	Obtaining birth control protection .	In part she had been so careful , but also because she would soon be a liability in the field .	because
0	157845	He looked away then handed her the rifle .	Rubbed his pounding temples .	and
2	53925	He had been hoping to ignore the realities .	Seeing chechikov had reminded him who he was , how they would never have a normal life .	but
0	117773	The birds set them down at the front gate .	Deposited the backpacks alongside .	and
0	37687	The kid and the kid is old enough to drink .	So pud pours him a beer .	and
2	111109	A great cataclysm and the forces of flowing magma eventually broke apart the single large landmass and .	Formed today 's seven smaller continents .	but
4	88069	Only he 'd taken a left .	He found the road rather than the right .	when
0	105124	The boxes were in all shapes sizes and .	Had different , colourful patterns printed on their sides .	and
2	6509	I think it 's supposed to be sexy .	It borders on nauseating .	but
1	118525	As my mind gave into the arctic sensation coursing through me , i waited for the flashes to begin .	There was no mistaking deaths icy hands .	because
2	141599	Left over from breakfast .	Doyle catches my hand .	but
0	6327	Besides , our cousin , sophie , was a prodigium .	Set to be head of the council .	and
0	54781	Alexia gave him a slight nod .	He let out a sigh of relief .	and
2	58788	What was best for her and even withhold knowledge .	Not only leave her out of the decisions .	but
4	159702	To achieving that goal .	I rounded the corner on approach to my office .	when
2	116145	They sold at the market .	Were unsold oftener , better than they themselves being sold .	but
2	124898	She regretted doing this , both to mount a pursuit and for the safety of the animals .	It would delay any search for her as the horses would need to be caught .	but
2	69359	Normally i held her hand when we were in crowds .	Today she was carrying an armload of her books .	but
2	128256	Not to think of it .	I still worried about what the food was doing to me since it should have gone bad and started to grow moldy days .	but
3	152530	I can help you .	You ask me for help .	if
3	87200	The lord ruler will have a difcult time stopping it .	A house war starts in earnest .	if
4	13290	He wears this big mask , but even with that , you cant spend more than a day or two in the stuff before well , before itll make you wish you hadnt .	Capn goes down to buy stuff .	when
2	40508	I can sense us getting closer to it , and i still dont like it , he set his gaze back to will .	I will follow you .	but
3	128737	I. cersei would be certain to grow curious .	Lollys 's bedmaid starting paying me calls .	if
0	40629	Whether the brute killed him himself or tormented him to the point that he took his own life , the sergeant was responsible .	Ben swore that one day he would make him pay .	and
2	140155	The place was filled with the same secondhand furniture and threadbare carpet she remembered .	It was tidier and actually cleaner .	but
0	54559	The man , generous beyond measure , drew money from his personal accounts .	Offered them , without stipulations or hesitations , to me .	and
0	56747	The bridge was vast .	It was a drop of awe inspiring depth that led to the forests and fields far below .	and
0	109971	The panel leaning , unfixed , across the gap .	Hurried around the narrow earthen rampart to join the grimfaced youths .	and
2	43899	We expected to banish paper . '' .	We actually banished thought .	but
2	65096	Whereas paris was calm , calculated , and .	Completely under his control , jacksons was wild .	but
1	125408	The curved colonnade around it is a memorial to a guy named voorhies .	Apparently he paid for it .	because
3	151986	It was that she was indeed capable of doing anything .	My sister had proved anything to me .	if
4	80977	It was usually grayson 's fault , because he forgot a chore or blew it off .	Something went wrong at hall aviation .	when
2	25511	Grey had to concede the logic of that point .	Couldnt convince himself , no .	but
2	80558	There was a trace of sadness in the words .	Caitlin seemed oblivious to it .	but
2	140488	I 'd taken a hard knock to the head and i seemed to be in one piece .	Cut open both of my palms .	but
2	2772	( there is still a silver wolf 's head at one end ... only it 's not really a hand at all , but a talon full of claws .	Now we see the shaft is carved with magical runes and symbols ) and grips hatch 's shoulder with the other .	but
2	65268	Haymitch is our only hope - everything will cost an exorbitant amount - or because he 's dissatisfied with our performance .	Nothing is forthcoming , either from lack of money .	but
4	11481	I stepped back and held out my left hand instead , just as i had done when we last met in san diego .	His arms lifted as if to embrace me .	when
0	96510	No one had ever given so much to her .	He barely knew her .	and
2	10503	It was impossible to see from where i was , and his killer smile revealed a dimple that drove women crazy .	I knew his eyes were a brilliant emerald green , his face was ruggedly handsome .	but
0	41425	How many had heard about an explosion in the courtyard .	Could even guess why this vengeance was pounding the city .	and
0	146815	Then he went back to his corner .	Curled up on the floor .	and
0	130591	John pulled down a plate .	Turned toward the stove , where richart waited .	and
0	123738	The dwarfs from people .	From the trolls and .	and
4	61494	He 'd given me at the waffle house the night .	I was rambling on about tangential swedishness and my bad cell-phone reception .	when
0	105338	The one who had threatened perrilin reacted .	Threw the hot poker at james .	and
2	39728	They walked on two feet , like men . '' .	Had much the appearance of animals .	but
0	131861	As one , they swung .	Stared at the empty space behind them .	and
4	23637	He had a real problem saying no .	It came to sarah .	when
2	100641	I never even visited the clubs my company owned .	Nina wanted to go out to a club , so i had little choice .	but
0	102508	The king in the centre ( no one could mistake him for anything but the king ) looked proudly and fiercely into lucy 's face .	Shook a spear in his hand .	and
0	52400	She would smile upon them , titania grow , you marvelous thing .	Call their ancient names .	and
0	98220	A guard in a brown drab uniform flung the door wide open .	Barged into the meeting .	and
2	73569	Ann was finally starting to recover .	This last week she had been so distant .	but
0	98580	The force of it ripped the blade-beast off of the ground slammed it into the wall not seven feet from isana 's head .	There was a blast of intense flame no larger than the mouth of a steadholt 's milking pail , but .	and
0	3415	We went trick-or-treating at thorne 's .	I told you he was a vampire .	and
2	50005	He did not understand a single word she had said .	They hit him like stones .	but
0	139417	If he even spoke to a woman , the gossip began .	A mere conversation would be turned into an affair before the sun fell .	and
3	39723	Then theres going to be heaps of trucks .	Its anything going into the city like it was coming out .	if
2	32821	My wife had been picking the vegetables in the garden .	When i got there i couldnt believe what i saw reno drew a deep breath , holding back tears .	but
2	87486	I was miserable because i was getting shelled .	It was also amusing to watch the mexicans dance and celebrate as the rout hit full stride .	but
2	38289	Maybe he flops around a little first .	That 's all there is to it .	but
4	106365	Duff noted how the fra 's wrinkled gaze followed the sway of linette 's hips .	She turned to leave .	when
1	128074	I 've been proud to follow your leadership .	You 've acted with courage and always - always - with rationality .	because
2	39551	At moat cailin the bog devils had loosed poisoned arrows at his men .	That was to be expected from such degraded creatures .	but
2	158842	Then i perused the bottles on the dressing table ( mostly scent , not all gardenia , a vast selection , so i picked something musky yet floral .	There was some powder , blusher and even kohl pencils .	but
0	88624	You pay me to swing a sword .	Speaking of pay serving god is a handsome reward and ive been keeping you in room and board .	and
2	160202	Messages were harder to crack because they constituted samples too small for quick decryption .	Eventually everything came to light .	but
4	71218	You only really started living your life .	You returned to wyoming .	when
4	99729	We had only traveled a few dozen light-years .	Our sensors lit up with movement .	when
3	49536	The noise would alert the servants , perhaps von schiissler .	Even he defended himself with his gun .	if
2	44069	She was fast lagar was stronger .	That made for a smaller target , and .	but
4	19906	I turned right and walked away from it .	I got to the end of the block , instead of crossing the street to my car .	when
0	83830	She trudged four miles to the strip .	Pawned one of her bracelets .	and
0	91900	Cutting out the usual small talk , i turned in my stool to face him .	He nodded , too nervous to say another word and screw this up .	and
2	32282	The sun had set about an hour earlier .	The streetlamps were not switched on .	but
2	54316	Sweat sheeted down his forehead into his eyes .	It smelled rusty , and when he wiped it away the back of his hand was bloodsmeared .	but
2	90591	Anywhere there was a better destination .	He did not know that .	but
3	26797	There was no point trying to deny it .	Even a part of her argument fell .	if
2	57275	Taking my car to trent 's wedding would have been easier .	This was safer when it came to getting pulled over by the i.s .	but
2	23858	Lizzie opened her mouth to protest .	The look on maggies face warned her to silence .	but
0	102571	I mean , he left my mother .	Never went back for her .	and
0	50184	He closed the door behind him .	Took a seat at his desk .	and
3	93567	What would they say .	They could see his own bald face , his own hairless chin , cheek , and lips .	if
1	89341	But anything the future brings is irrelevant .	I am positive of one thing .	because
1	46130	I had no time to wallow in the happiness .	The hands of the biggest guy of the bunch were closing over my throat .	because
3	2136	His family-or his mate-he had to protect her .	A man claimed a woman .	if
0	5615	There was no portal .	We were all going to be drowned .	and
0	92970	The street which ran down to the wharf was lined on both sides with the shops of drasnian merchants .	Nyissans moved torpidly from shop to shop , stopping now and then to haggle with the sweating shop-keepers .	and
3	95107	Would serve you and even bring the magic .	You would allow me , for that is how my heart was cast when i rose from the prim .	if
0	122055	`` sorry , man , '' i whispered , only partway .	Went to the door opening it .	and
3	107891	Then i have no chance to run at all . '' .	We cover this up , and i introduce you and you kill her .	if
0	143973	The man knew how to do something .	He could teach her .	and
4	151497	`` quite frankly , chase 's judgment is wonderful , but it sucks when it comes to his personal life . '' .	It comes to his family .	when
3	9804	And , i 'd hit the pavement at sixty or seventy miles per hour .	I tried to jump .	if
0	45609	Cassandra sensed capitulation . '' .	Pushed , `` we have a potion .	and
2	60578	What he 'd already set in place was incredibly impressive and persuasive .	If he thought she would discard the life she 'd worked for to suit his time-table , he could think .	but
2	62798	Ian said , pretending not to believe her .	She worried maybe her mercedes , designer clothes , and fear of the water hadnt given him the impression that she was capable of being silly .	but
2	68546	I decided to visit the ops room .	Stopped at the stairs when someone called my name .	but
1	7610	He was there was .	Jessica shouldnt have been .	because
2	121767	Yeah , she 's going to be pissed about the brittany thing .	It 's not like you can help it .	but
2	142561	`` i think i 'm going to like you , '' he said , `` .	I have a few rules myself , if you want full access to me . '' .	but
1	55621	When your mother refuses to tell anyone before she gets trapped in the underworld , '' i replied , with a small amount of bitterness .	I wished she 'd have told someone .	because
0	153702	Finally clutching her hands around herself .	Trying to duck into an open doorway just to her side .	and
4	36514	It 's time for me to vamoose . '' .	Women start playing with vibrators .	when
0	139999	The elevator stopped rising .	Came to a crashing halt .	and
0	74763	Sally shook her head while struggling to focus on gabe through hazy eyes .	Ran her fingers through her hair .	and
0	115623	He gave an experimental tug at the chain .	Then climbed back up on the tractor .	and
3	35536	Might have another three hours or they might have much less .	Her description of the battery decay had been accurateand if manis hadnt lied to her about itthey .	if
3	122486	They should be able to do what needs to be done .	The maag smiths cast bronze arrowheads for them .	if
3	154883	I actually had very little involvement in the whole thing .	You want to know the truth .	if
0	158954	The big gelding looked .	Then wandered back over to bob .	and
2	75191	You 'd think it would make us invisible .	It did n't . .	but
0	150417	He pulled his gaze from the audi .	Spared suzanne a glance before flipping open her phone .	and
2	36239	I never really thought about it . '' .	When i was first inducted into daedalus , i was always tired .	but
0	42064	Prentice had wrapped an arm strong around her waist .	He glued her to his side .	and
0	149340	Hed have given up been trampled into the dust .	Fallen from his horse .	and
0	48174	But this rabid is female . '' .	I think you 'll all agree that complicates things .	and
1	125100	God , keep my heart soft toward the poor .	I want my heart to be like yours .	because
2	97775	The captain had given her passage .	He had no time to speak with her .	but
2	157122	The land totalled several acres .	The properties had been largely neglected during the lengthy illness which , ultimately brought about the demise of his uncle .	but
0	139251	A firm grasp on her hand and a very stern negative in her mind made her hesitate kept her .	Myme chlo was drawn towards them , but .	and
0	38946	Then she straightened instead ran headlong into cash .	Turned to run downstairs .	and
3	118767	Hand it to a fae-the shifters .	I steal the sword-and worse .	if
2	52635	Drade did not resume the whistling .	Instead joined the other two in staring at the ground .	but
0	109144	I think i like gin 's costume a lot better than mine , '' owen rumbled .	Stepped into the den .	and
0	92972	Hardy decided to light a cigar .	Forgot that he was bathing his feet in turpentine .	and
2	46418	I stumble over the sand trying to regain my footing .	In a flash , my arm is free and jude has the man by the throat .	but
2	69842	That 's how i 've put it . '' .	It 's easy changed , if ye like .	but
0	94455	Who presumably loved her .	Wanted to spend the rest of his life with her had failed her when she desperately needed him .	and
3	94114	It could swear the funeral was going on right now around me .	My broken heart didnt know any better .	if
0	23767	I 'll head out as soon as i can and i 'll keep my eyes peeled for .	I cringe as i say this , things out of the ordinary for us . '' .	and
0	40274	When the moment of truth arrived .	She showed him that she meant every word of her devotion .	and
2	106577	She had begged and he had not reached her .	She had pleaded for layel 's help .	but
2	6948	True , life was at first an experiment .	What has manifested is so much more than perhaps even she anticipated .	but
2	43922	Oh dear , you still look rough .	Youre a tough cookie .	but
0	153857	He didnt quite know what to say .	So gave hedren leave to berate and lecture him .	and
2	83165	I was only expecting to talk .	Sophia turned out to be a wild child .	but
1	57067	You find life such a problem .	You think there are the good people and the bad people .	because
2	102310	`` excuse me ? '' .	Are you flirting with me .	but
2	43529	The bridge was just visible above him , maybe fifty yards distant .	No one was on it-yet .	but
2	61788	The name of the game had become to get a pair of such human-mothered taltos and to make them breed more taltos , and .	To keep a stock of these prisoners , to make them dance , to make them sing , to make them give birth .	but
1	85895	'' `` we 're .	Two thousand years ago you f**ked kate hewson and destroyed your wife .	because
3	48931	Wait until you see the baby shower . '' .	You thought the wedding was big .	if
2	143232	The smell of exhaust was prominent it was still home .	The area was loud with cars quickly pulling up to the curb to pick up passengers , and .	but
2	107494	She wasnt interested in a heart-to-heart with him .	She felt like she was backed into a corner .	but
2	49888	`` that 's very good news .	Let 's not count our chickens .	but
2	74796	He said they could have the candy bugs , and .	He would tell them the gifts were from me , their aunt suzanne .	but
0	140086	Straightening , i wiped my hands off on my jeans .	Looked at the red light of sunset shining against the familiar stones i mowed around every week .	and
2	71350	Sighing , he set the application .	Before he could speak , she blurted out , `` are you married ? '' .	but
3	14613	There would be blood .	He fell and cut his head .	if
0	83854	In such a contest , someone 's goose would cook .	Wiz 's chance impressed the chief as slim , so lucifer 's suggestion tempted him .	and
0	75799	Despite his ragged clothing , he wore genuine legionare 's boots .	His leather sword belt shone with age , it bore a genuine gladius at his hip-and there was nothing old or ragged about the short , powerfully curved hunting bow in his hands .	and
3	59118	He began warily , the people might regard it as treason .	Even we come to agreement to act as you are suggesting .	if
1	131201	Of course , the reason that katarina had been at devenallt mountain for nearly a year was .	The queen had been reminding lord berg of her power .	because
0	113904	I glanced to my right .	Saw my father walking purposefully toward us .	and
4	95476	His green-golden eyes snapped open .	They came in the door .	when
2	58643	The echoes made it hard to tell who was coming or how many .	The sound was sharp and percussive .	but
4	55722	Ammar flinging her away from him .	She 'd reached for him that awful evening in the hotel .	when
4	46897	He would have to pick .	She was running late for the art museum thing .	when
4	146765	Stood by captain leonard at sunset .	He read the burial service .	when
2	49811	They were still a few hours from the second crossing .	Given the temperature , she thought it was for the best .	but
0	6957	At least its not moving .	Appears to be parked on the side .	and
2	108816	From your perspective , you saved her from the light rail accident and .	Then saw her get shot .	but
0	104589	He ducked his head .	Looked at her through his lashes .	and
3	142829	He still thought about them .	What his life might have been he could only have been their child .	if
4	23634	What brooks was going to do .	He found out i 'd left him .	when
2	4730	It wasnt like he was one of the evil stepsisters and rude to her on purpose .	She seemed to always find herself at odds with him .	but
0	135413	The huge male nodded .	Stretched out a muscular arm .	and
2	112988	The approaching body did not walk upright .	Instead scurried forward , supporting its weight on its long arms as well as its legs .	but
2	57417	The boys seemed surprised .	Then one of the biggest ones laughed .	but
2	7461	I had plenty in the tank .	Turns out i did n't . .	but
1	140545	The driver knew his alternate routes .	Traffic was a nightmare .	because
2	141734	He has been looking at the lake .	Now he turns to look at me .	but
0	149525	She led me to the sink .	Started running cold water on my hand .	and
4	152637	They 'd still want to be my friends .	All was said and done .	when
4	11588	She 'd planned for the eight months it would take her to learn what she needed to know and get her broker 's license .	She 'd purchased the house and her business .	when
3	76026	In those days before seatbelts , i sometimes was thrown forward too , and landed on the bowing seatback .	I hadnt braced myself .	if
0	145021	Such spots were usually taken .	Kept for days at a time by campers .	and
2	148163	I i didnt mean to find it , or to read it .	We were sorting through all the things that were saved and just tell me .	but
4	154491	Actually lied to her .	He 'd claimed it had been the fru .	when
0	35383	The red-hooded figure had just climbed in .	Appeared to be talking to someone invisible behind a pile of sacks .	and
0	85907	The weapon was long , slightly curved .	The lacquered scabbard was painted with a long , sinuous dragon of red and gold .	and
0	118946	To go down to the coliseum .	Supervise the set-up crew .	and
0	69257	I am already making preparations .	Will begin in a few moments .	and
0	134476	Bones pulled to a stop at the truck .	I jumped off the motorcycle as soon as it quit moving .	and
1	5936	The u.s. government did not directly retaliate .	They had been warned in advance yet they ignored it .	because
4	144855	Jake was in the lead .	He almost walked into the marker post .	when
1	98864	Indeed , after a short wait , troy and kiaras faces .	Clear inside the box ; and seth knew the twins could see his and iris faces just the same way .	because
0	49607	She breathed anxiously against the strip of leather that gagged her .	For one moment something about the entire scene surprised her , the winding lane , the deserted little shops , the tall woman in the red velvet bodice and broad red skirt walking in front of her , her long black hair curling loosely down her narrow back .	and
4	103223	Realizing a devoted bridgework employee -- e.g. , staple -- knew no boundaries .	It came to fulfilling a mission .	when
2	29615	He really hated to admit it .	She was a hell of a cook .	but
3	5634	You must hurry . '' .	You wish to talk to him before he does .	if
2	59547	I moaned quietly even though i wanted to scream from the pleasure .	I was afraid someone would hear me .	but
2	10392	She went rigid in anticipation of more pain .	She felt only the tickle of his soft hair against her jaw and a featherlight brush of lips .	but
3	86067	She would have told me .	She was going to have gone someplace .	if
4	35227	My voice was not quite steady .	I finally found it .	when
0	46232	Laura found this cane for me . '' .	It 's been a great help .	and
0	117703	Give the beast some .	See if it works .	and
0	42475	Largely they had enough money to buy the necessary votes .	To pay the exorbitant prices the nyissans charged for their poisons .	and
2	54175	She stopped hitting him .	It was only the calm before the storm .	but
2	113269	The object was not on the bottom of the container as he expected .	Rather it was floating in the center - suspended in midair - a shimmering globule of mercurylike liquid .	but
0	21351	That afternoon , she walked into mitchell madison 's garden .	Looked around with interest .	and
3	9476	... '' cassandra sighed .	It could be rolled aside a couple of feet .	if
3	24113	But , why did they wait until .	They could do this .	if
2	26961	He helped her down from the makeup chair , and stopped .	Turned around to walk across the room to the sofa .	but
2	99991	Ant only wanted to ask how much .	Added the rest as an afterthought .	but
3	1633	`` honey , maybe it 's best . '' .	You talk to the police .	if
2	154788	I dont understand how this has happened .	I know it is the strangers doing , his invisible string .	but
4	69692	She could come on to him .	He got back from the shower .	when
2	66200	Seb was barely conscious .	He managed to look up at me .	but
4	61838	I look up at sean .	I pull it open .	when
4	126536	To describe the feeling .	He lifted his hips and ian 's head moved inside him .	when
2	26362	My mouth opened to speak .	Snapped shut when sofie 's mint eyes flashed with another stern warning .	but
4	16964	February cold sank into you .	February was here and it seemed that april never would be .	when
0	93724	We met the most lovely couple at the spa .	Invited them to stay .	and
2	40804	Turn after turn left me dizzy and disorientated .	When i spun around another looming corner i found myself trapped .	but
3	122707	It 's unlikely she could 've pushed it open after inhaling all that smoke .	Even ali made it to the door .	if
4	103545	Instead of filling her with barren regret .	Eventually the thought of him made her smile .	when
0	46401	I had to hit jonah eventually was nothing more than a fanged party crasher .	Hopefully i 'd also confuse the guys who thought i .	and
0	106897	He waved the shotgun over my head .	Motioned for me to stop talking .	and
0	2297	`` well , david here is going over , so to speak , '' .	Make them feel welcome .	and
2	94968	Sam starts to stand .	Henri keeps him down .	but
0	50968	This time as i awoke in the morning , i opened my eyes .	Saw a deer in the bushes a few yards away eating berries .	and
0	37505	She had seen something , something .	She was so focused on her effort to think what it might have been that she did not hear the driver 's door of the police car open and then chunk softly shut .	and
0	53918	Haley had already left saturday morning for her week of training with the mountaineering school .	Michelle was too nervous about bugs to sleep outside .	and
0	125237	Go get your cousin .	Both of you get into your disguises .	and
2	86334	I liked what i saw about the village .	I did feel an apprehensive chill the first time it came into view .	but
3	42860	But i can bail .	You want me to .	if
0	63367	She waved , feeling curiously empty despite the full meal she 'd ingested .	Got into the car to drive home .	and
2	93600	One note was bad .	This guy was really starting to piss me off .	but
0	21091	We just buy an existing lake .	Build the resort on it .	and
0	103164	Hell , maybe she 'd even let the accountant spear her .	They 'd had some sort of fishing trip fling .	and
2	64800	She hurried out of the room and the hug had left her feeling so flustered she ended up stumbling back to the master bedroom instead of searching for luke .	Tried not to dwell on what she 'd just done .	but
2	134574	The two energies crackled and spat .	Alyosha kept them from engaging .	but
2	121475	I 'd always taken precautions .	Somehow my shot had run out .	but
3	20945	The vampire world will resemble a huge multinational corporation more than a loosely ruled collection of vicious bloodsuckers . '' .	The american model catches on .	if
3	39072	It would not have saved her , secondly , i have no idea how many armed men there are over .	I had shot him .	if
4	73237	Pumped up lips and little botox for the wrinklesi dont like it . '' .	Faces actually move you know .	when
2	55147	So i got the whole guardian thing .	Now the whole vampire thing seemed more plausible .	but
3	75622	I never would have brought you here . '' .	I 'd known that .	if
0	141486	He made a deep incision in his own wrist .	Placed the torn , bleeding flesh over the dying man 's mouth .	and
3	78452	Are you up to showing it .	These people are interested .	if
3	134496	And the previous two nannies turned out fine .	Even they each had to leave for different reasons .	if
3	44675	Then satan must ascend to his position .	A man dethrones god in his heart .	if
2	7964	`` here is my address . '' .	If you need to call me , my cell number is on the front .	but
0	74668	Them handling the crows .	Would be paying attention .	and
2	59806	Man had paid a huge price for his hubris and neglect .	A merciful creator had given them a way to redeem themselves .	but
2	18250	Drew pulled the handlebars .	The highway fought him for every inch .	but
0	47223	Give us this day our daily bread , as we forgive those that trespass against us .	Forgive us our trespasses .	and
3	99604	They could pull out before we even arrive .	We 're too slow , depending on whether they 're finding other survivors .	if
3	56713	No one will notice her when she 's moving on the back of a horse .	You can disguise gemma .	if
2	16542	They used the downing of our airliner to go to war against iran . ' .	They 're also apparently running a side mission .	but
2	56047	It was difficult to work out what tourniquet wanted .	I knew that in the end it wouldnt make any difference .	but
0	123441	She slid her hands around his waist , finding the small of his back .	Giving it a little caress , the embrace returned .	and
2	138053	She had done it , and , tell the truth .	The old gypsy woman had darted oh .	but
0	153199	The mountains had a life of their own .	Did not heed mortal men .	and
2	114077	He looked through the aisles of shelves .	Most of the boxes were blank , or text only labels .	but
2	4489	The blue veins still twined up her limbs .	Color had returned to her cheeks .	but
0	146386	Severance walked into the bedroom she had been using .	Stood cidra carefully on her feet .	and
3	113419	What chax would say .	He could see me .	if
2	57224	Joan started to object as she started .	Dante beat her too it .	but
0	134336	Both were thoroughly soiled from the long hard ride .	Neither seemed to care about this .	and
4	49032	All is good and hope is restored until he wakes up .	An attempted relapse lands jon a lucrative cage fighting opportunity .	when
3	142899	`` , we go .	We 're to have any chance of that .	if
4	135926	`` ran out of the ward . '' .	I opened the doors to come in .	when
2	151901	A vamp alone in the wild with no source of blood was a damn fool .	There was no time .	but
2	26439	It was tricky and risky .	I had always thrived on a good challenge , which was how i had ended up tangled up in the criminal underground with bax all those years .	but
0	94559	She had a few select friends .	Confined her entertainments to simple outings with them or with her mother and sister .	and
2	147652	Well , then , i guess i 'll give you a break this time , and this time only . '' .	Only you teach me what i need to do in order not to look like a birdbrain when my father gets here in two weeks .	but
2	69303	Morning came , and kelly didnt feel much better .	At least she was cramping .	but
1	69747	Carla had sent him the book .	She knew about the fear .	because
2	150500	This may sound absurd .	It was a difficult thing to leave in the first place .	but
2	121838	Haven tried to head back outside when he reached the foyer .	He threw his hand out to stop her .	but
0	19719	Tomorrow karla and i will figure out what went wrong . '' .	We 'll fix it .	and
3	138609	It was a strange coincidence .	It was a coincidence at all .	if
0	63399	Rob rolled his shoulders .	Casually walked over to a cameraman who was leaning against a wall with his camera between his feet .	and
3	11426	They might as well be in a team .	They were going to be together forever and ever and .	if
3	114831	It means i did something wrong .	You find the charred remains of the hab .	if
0	115552	The fishermen of the south coast of dhrall know all about them . '' .	They know how to avoid them .	and
0	77449	He grabbed the edges , croyd lunging futilely for his desserts .	Hurled it out of the way .	and
0	26707	Lady kingair sniffed when they entered the room , but apart from that , made no comment about any change in state .	Then glared at the two men .	and
0	62720	Power gathered , pushing him away , but he only laughed and returned to tending to her with his tongue .	Released from her abdomen .	and
0	88085	Himself grab silvers by the collar .	Throw his head into the wall .	and
2	19439	`` sorry , camel , '' mary jo called , `` . '' .	Your reputation has preceded you and i 'm not giving you a chance to bite my arm .	but
0	69657	Eric was supernatural and he was a great fighter .	He was incredibly strong .	and
4	77570	Well , i gave him a copy of the prints .	He was here last night .	when
4	137376	I always wondered about that .	I came here with my band mates to get smashed .	when
4	103634	Something happens to the soul .	They stop your heart from beating for that long .	when
3	14901	Can cut off electricity to any portion of the ride .	It detects a problem .	if
0	32768	I had known who i was .	Thought i had a good idea of where i was going .	and
0	55773	That slid them away from the chrystum .	They turned past the final boulder that evening , mr. clancy stopped and looked back past the mountain khourne , through the night airs and across the landscape .	and
2	128156	My name is deodatus .	You can call me deo for short .	but
0	129688	He pulsed under her touch .	Felt the thrill that went through her as she learned the extent of her own power over him .	and
2	78239	I was asking you a question .	It seems that you clearly did not hear me .	but
3	90359	I may join you in your killing spree .	That is the case .	if
2	148260	I didnt really want it .	Maybe it would give me something to do before the pile of shredded napkins on the table qualified as a fire hazard .	but
2	3377	Demane had given kulingile still more food during the flight .	A consultation of their stores confirmed the truth .	but
4	41799	He also felt the snapping point .	She lost the struggle and her head turned slowly toward him .	when
4	153586	His eyes opened all the way with surprise .	I replaced the drink with a dry sausage .	when
4	99078	He saw you as a liability . '' .	You 're my greatest asset .	when
2	116385	She might deny how much she does .	I can see it .	but
4	117915	Go of the book .	She so badly wanted it near her .	when
4	62520	How perfect it felt .	She fell asleep in his embrace each night .	when
0	12104	He held out his hand , mein junge .	Took christians in a firm grip guten tag .	and
2	138229	My fingers tightened around the neck of the beer bottle .	I resisted the urge to throw it at his head .	but
0	130107	Dashing back and forth sitting on their small wolf butts and howling .	Running in circles around graham .	and
3	156187	They can probably tell us a lot .	- we can pull them .	if
2	148364	And i should feel guilty for saying those things in front of sophie .	I 'm too mad to think .	but
3	68853	Not much difference between escape velocity and crash and burn .	You want a rocket analogy .	if
2	48319	You , yourself , are not of israel , were you .	Were rather a prophet of the land of ammon .	but
0	57093	To take him out .	Hit him on the head with a shovel .	and
3	113906	`` , all we have to do to survive .	I 'm right about all this being parental violence .	if
3	28371	I cant help it .	I am more intelligent than most people .	if
4	36433	Summer seemed exactly that weak .	I started to really think about it .	when
0	130703	Coin got to his feet in one movement .	Swung the staff over his head .	and
3	86502	He 'll be devastated .	He learns the truth .	if
3	46692	Aaron would freak out .	He woke up and saw himself standing next to him .	if
4	26143	The birds that knew the sun was coming .	No one else did .	when
0	13445	One of our patrols was attacked last night .	The patrol leader wounded .	and
0	107501	A deep red serpent border curved around the edges of the runestone .	Framed the inscription on it .	and
3	87306	You would not be .	I knew the answer to that .	if
0	88833	Send men to the temple of the graces .	Ask if any man has come to the blue graces with a sword wound .	and
3	126406	I didnt even care .	You were her boyfriend or .	if
2	105110	His staff was four meters .	If he attempted to move his hand to call it marnn would see , and then blast him over the edge of the castle wall .	but
0	28467	To check on incoming passenger numbers .	To advise about departing passengers who wanted accommodation on their return to manila .	and
0	132809	He pulls a stocking cap down over the driver 's eyes .	Runs duct tape around it to blindfold him .	and
3	52711	But terreille would be hers .	Even she had to use a weak little puppet like dorothea to get it .	if
3	48637	The dog could think , and tied together the loose ends .	Such a thing was possible .	if
3	106938	Then , spumoni would be the first thing on the menu .	He ever had the opportunity to indulge in mortal food .	if
0	59453	He grabbed ash 's feet .	Helped to carry him .	and
2	40729	I dropped my eyes , nodding rapidly , wishing i could obey .	Thoughts slithered on the edge of consciousness : brute with his horrible breath and fingers ; driver with his lies and hair pulling .	but
0	156910	We stayed there for a while , long after the food was gone .	I think everyone was delaying the inevitable-the big talk .	and
0	124129	To communicate with each other .	Failing horribly at it .	and
1	46393	More and more he got older .	Probably he had been bigger than her for the past two years .	because
3	33282	I was not on the red cross .	Even i was immobile she still would not be able to kill me .	if
4	30661	The kind of quiet a person gets .	They 're busy restraining their fear for you to respond .	when
4	84962	Then , it became rock solid .	She heard what he had to say .	when
2	94522	Eddie admired this ambition .	Foresaw problems with it .	but
2	134650	Some believe the devil made of sand was an american special forces unit using chemical weapons .	No proof exists to put fact to this theory .	but
4	111896	She told me to come back to the hospital to hold her in my arms one last time while she yet lives , as she will probably be dead by tonight .	I went out before to ask my mother to come here she told me my daughter was dying .	when
3	145189	Then looked to his brother .	Confirming that she 'd dared argue with the laird .	if
4	44055	To help a confused man .	You yourself are confused .	when
2	51064	I thought he was friendlier than me .	He might have been able to argue that .	but
2	20715	One of them began to object .	Pyotr cut him off .	but
2	42327	I was half expectin ' him to make a dash for it .	Instead he just pulls off his shirt .	but
3	34991	To appease leavitts spirit .	It still lingered at the scene of his second death .	if
2	115718	The magazines slid out of her hand and she did as he told her .	She glared at him .	but
4	41473	He was a kind and soft man .	You got to know him .	when
4	134941	They 'd already insinuated themselves among the throngs in steerage .	Their jailers , two crewmen named laurette and rivers , came looking for them in the morning .	when
0	126636	The guards put ninas soldiers in the bathtub .	Released the water hose to them .	and
0	53522	Call me in a couple of days . '' .	We 'll go to new york .	and
0	151273	When he reached the soldiers at the marketplace , they may put two and two .	Come up with the four of them .	and
0	56279	Under the sea , smoke rises in bubbles .	Flames burn green and blue and black .	and
0	120416	Jon shook the dirt from inside it .	A stream of arrowheads fell out .	and
2	80392	`` i know . '' .	I 'd rather you drank from me than from some other woman .	but
2	125421	Ramon forced himself to laugh .	It came out thin and tinny .	but
2	111513	Other than dozens of responses wishing him well , his efforts had led to nothing more legitimately promising than two breeders and three processors saying that they werent hiring , but .	If something opened up after the market regained some steam , they would be in touch .	but
2	86501	Of course it was true .	Everyone knows , hope dies .	but
0	11592	As they passed , duke nodded .	John matthew , as he was called , did the same-and that was the extent of it .	and
2	126637	For the time being we go about our business as normal .	We keep our eyes open .	but
0	126827	Hodor lifted bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay .	Cradled him against his massive chest .	and
2	28358	He sensed it , and .	Kept glancing back at that corner with a narrowed eye , in hopes of keeping them subdued .	but
0	143181	The crib was set up , all was in readiness .	Diaper service had been ordered .	and
3	47254	They would be horrified .	They discovered how chaotic creation was and how much damage mankind had done .	if
2	109404	My parents would never do something like that .	I wasnt going to say so to carley .	but
2	90341	Glancing on either side of us , i spied ezra .	His back was to us as he was dancing with his mom .	but
0	5113	That told him they were up for the job .	They melted away into the night , working their way up the slope to lie just outside the fence in the space their assigned guard patrolled .	and
2	145455	Tyler had been getting an associate 's degree so he could be an emt , and he 'd had to drop out .	Then he had been arrested for carrying his mother 's drugs .	but
2	126399	Making better food choices had become easier .	Her gaze often lingered on sweets and on the candy machine .	but
0	80989	He seemed so much bigger .	As she looked down , she saw only faded scars on his lower body , nothing that would warrant self-consciousness .	and
3	59108	We 'll get sloppy . '' .	We get caught up in this .	if
0	27856	He had known before she 'd even opened the door .	He did not have bee 's buzzing through his head .	and
3	54968	`` but - `` `` he learned it once he was older .	Stephen did not know .	if
3	49490	And could she help it .	Her pelvis was suddenly twitchy , causing her to wriggle on his lap .	if
0	91048	There 's no need to be alarmed .	We 're grateful that you 're letting us look around without a warrant .	and
0	134346	Some were the height of children , some matched up with adults .	A few were larger than man-sized .	and
2	145508	There are those who pass through the plains of mimbre who find the ruins picturesque and romantic .	That 's usually long after the smoke and stench have been blown away and the seasons have washed off the blood .	but
3	40562	Cash would not be pleased .	She chit chatted with his glamorous new girlfriend in his office instead of doing the work he paid her to do .	if
0	53699	All and im programmed for repairing and healing .	Here i am the commanding officer on a dangerous infiltration mission .	and
0	156573	Over my lifetime ive been confused more often than .	Found not responding is better in most circumstances because it leaves the person believing you might have some understanding of whats going on .	and
3	67148	I 'll slug you myself . '' .	It comes to that .	if
4	78340	You contributed to her brokenness .	You used her that first night .	when
2	133378	Coldhand raised his laser pistol .	Maeve put her hand lightly atop his and shook her head .	but
4	134615	... no , i mean , the prey of the foxes that hunt .	The foxes are praying .	when
2	8790	The vertical acceleration increased .	Never reached an uncomfortable level .	but
2	99414	Me was a great blackness , and i had to believe that somewhere in my future was a happy ending .	It was wide and sweeping .	but
0	158776	She landed in the puddle next to him .	Slapped the ground in frustration .	and
0	112651	I arched an eyebrow at her .	Waited while she fidgeted and finally asked .	and
2	92260	I realize you have plenty of reasons not to trust me .	All i know is that astrid 's parents were at the house baby-sitting my nephew .	but
0	139696	He slowly dug the well-worn baseball out of his pocket .	Kept his right hand behind his back .	and
0	159133	When she began to slap .	Punch him about the head and shoulders .	and
4	134561	She sat beside him , trying not to stare at the muscled expanse of his back .	He stretched his massive body out on the bed .	when
0	135209	The rest of you will be outlaws .	Annias will let the commons know that you 're keeping the one thing that will stave off otha .	and
2	134949	Allie knew she 'd have to deal with it at some point and .	Worried that this would only put off her recovery .	but
0	24870	We dined together in the morning she taught me to dance and play cards in the evening before she retired for bed .	Took calls together in the afternoon .	and
3	89762	He also has jodi 's . '' .	The handler has hope 's scent .	if
0	25696	The whole village of lowsunn had arrived .	There were so many people that many were even standing beyond otallis small borders .	and
3	7011	Will children still be welcomed into the world .	There are no rooms made empty for them .	if
0	6587	Kat turned with a gloomy expression .	When she saw the cup , her face brightened .	and
3	90528	Mention it to lady victoria .	Your throat 's bothering you .	if
2	6811	I am grateful , and . '' .	It i shall not let you make this mistake .	but
0	1437	There 's a rustling of wrappers .	Soon all that 's left is a few crumbs .	and
0	116391	We 've seen no sign of anyone tracking us . '' .	This valley is isolated and elusive .	and
4	6968	There 's nothing wrong with it .	You have a relationship like you and amy .	when
4	69745	Twilight was finally stealing upon the world .	Harriet retired to her bedchamber .	when
4	46140	She comes to a halt .	She sees that i 'm blocking the doorway .	when
2	4690	I know of one that might help , '' she said , `` . '' .	I 've never tried it .	but
0	43778	He collected my empty plate at the same time .	Refilled my coffee cup .	and
3	98169	She never would have loved me .	Id just kept her alive .	if
4	131542	*** i was surprised speechless .	Andrew and mr. monroe arrived .	when
0	91507	His eyelids drooped , his hand dropped to the mat , head falling onto his improvised pillow .	He slipped back into sleep .	and
3	124459	It would be convenient .	His entire family would be together for the highstorm .	if
3	49395	Me feel even worse .	That was even possible .	if
0	135845	She 'll teach you .	She 'll be responsible for you .	and
3	149159	But , in his valley ... `` did you deserve the strapping ? '' .	Someone else had been doing more .	if
3	86682	To take the blame .	My parents got angry and swore to withhold my tuition .	if
2	26132	His temperature , oddly enough , was not greatly above normal .	The whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder .	but
2	52630	I think we can get around those .	I 'll have to give you a little more time .	but
2	57954	I take it as the end of the conversation and he stops me .	Start to head back to the other side of the van .	but
2	78874	`` i ... '' victoria tried .	Knew she 'd be lying and he 'd know it .	but
0	78814	All mirrors to the wall .	Had not the slightest curiosity about what edward now `` looked like .	and
3	56296	He 'd string me to his guitar .	I tried to sneak back into the mediation rooms .	if
0	89888	That thought will lock it into a heavy box .	Throw it into that .	and
4	30841	What did the church do to you .	You were prosecuting the gottich claim .	when
0	91157	Grace put one hand to the dark rock .	Felt its solidity , its unyielding density .	and
4	24732	But she didnt like it .	I went out with them .	when
0	76884	We were brothers . '' .	You stole my heart .	and
3	4866	`` well i 'll talk about mine and how my boss had me running all over boston doing personal errands for him on a saturday . '' .	You 're not going to talk about your obviously very busy day .	if
2	84955	I wanted to kiss him .	He reached for a piece of battered and fried sweet potato from our vegetable tempura plate .	but
4	5764	Seeking out her comfort .	I knew it could never be something i would deserve .	when
3	96032	I had no memory of it .	He 'd been there i was recuperating .	if
3	93583	Good is a finished poem .	Its going to be good at all .	if
4	148077	Reed was changing frequencies on his suit radio .	Without warning , the hatch opened and retracted and he found himself looking straight at the masked face of dr. karl bauer .	when
4	81932	Just how he put it .	Anyone asked what he did to keep himself in cocktail onions .	when
0	83428	They might just beat you up send you packing .	Steal the clothes off your .	and
0	16078	That his team had grins on their faces , he swept her into his arms kissed her .	Uncaring that sergeant major was watching , or .	and
2	28776	I tried to stand .	Someone shouted just audible above the cacophony , keep low and try to make your way out of the cave .	but
4	25726	The most common is .	His hand absently rubs the side of his neck , behind his left ear .	when
3	24452	`` will you feel better ? '' .	I tell you that i 'm okay .	if
2	49586	Foundation was out of the question since my face was so cut up .	I did manage a little eye shadow and mascara .	but
4	21083	Why else would they have shipped him off to boarding school .	He still had his baby teeth .	when
2	16346	She paused when she saw them at the bar .	Strode into the room .	but
4	66653	She wore the veronica lake look with the hair falling over her left eye .	She was at work and used a barrette to keep her hair behind her ear .	when
2	35967	It was almost dawn .	Hardly any activity had started .	but
3	131894	Along with the computers that held the records of their balances , anarchy would be the kind word for what would happen .	All the credit chits were wiped .	if
3	117618	You have only to call me if you need me . '' .	You decide to stay .	if
0	150003	He called with a case .	The followup call established that he knew you .	and
0	142228	Joe retrieved the new locks from the seat .	Headed towards the front door .	and
3	142419	So that i could run , i might have reached hebron before dark .	The snow had been hard enough to support my weight .	if
2	21751	I will miss london when i leave it , and there 's something missing .	I know i will look forward to returning .	but
4	129605	I worked for ethan .	He got a few death threats .	when
3	156484	She could cover her tracks and reach help , if necessary .	Even he had left men behind .	if
0	30234	They 've been planning this .	They were using the origins to do it .	and
0	100391	Give me some of the leaves and smaller stuff .	Then just scatter that stuff .	and
0	64733	For frodo it was a torment soon a nightmare .	It was hard enough for poor sam , tired as he was ; but .	and
1	117578	I assume they are just finishing the night shift their chins propped on their hands , or slumped against broomsticks , barely remembering to sweep .	They are hunched over screens .	because
0	128008	I finally stood up .	Held it towards the moonlight filtering in through the window behind .	and
2	83745	There were all sorts of ways to petition the great god .	They depended largely on how much you could afford , which was right and proper and exactly how things should be .	but
0	41558	The sun was hot , the smell was appalling .	The flies were frantic .	and
0	13055	He pushed through the leaves and limbs , determined and angry already planning his next move .	Thick trees surrounded him , but .	and
3	20516	You guys an invitation to the wedding .	You want to come .	if
2	91684	Nick left him to check on simi .	There was no sign of her .	but
2	24145	You 're a part of it now and ... ' he yanked me up by my collar .	How i see it , girly .	but
0	147409	Now would come the fulfillment of that interlude .	That was what she wanted to see , not two babbies shagging each other like they were the first two on earth to discover how ' t was done .	and
2	149093	Xavier kept his eyes trained forward throughout the entire process .	His curiosity made this unusually difficult .	but
1	73694	I had ever had .	Clearly someone was following us .	because
2	55782	It had long hidden .	Dared not erase because those servers were its reason for existing .	but
2	67061	That 's true . '' .	You 'll finally get to bring brynne up to scotland so she can see the place .	but
2	148686	His second glance took longer .	He said no more , turning away to descend a set of narrow steps behind the bar .	but
4	120655	The giggle became a sigh .	He brushed it from his eyes .	when
0	59289	Some friends are there for the moment and they fade as time passes .	There are the ones that are with you for the long haul .	and
0	128567	She faced what she was afraid of .	Then it held no more fear .	and
0	67986	Though the earth-bound enterprise rested on immense pillars , the shiny-white structure was powered up , as evidenced by numerous lights .	Appeared to be poised to lift-off .	and
0	53719	The next morning one of the guards woke them before it was even fully light outside left them .	Gave them each a drink of water .	and
2	131887	Her grandfather had written everything up with the precision of a scientist .	What he was writing about was bizarre-and sometimes frightening .	but
0	106587	That had dried out the mora at merrilor .	Let the trollocs cross the river with ease .	and
3	158781	That is something to be proud of .	Even death is the end of everything .	if
4	114181	I heard the smile in his voice . '' .	He said , `` i like it .	when
2	65012	They became soaked as well as exhausted .	Were able to refill their skins with what they hoped was drinkable water .	but
3	151623	I 'd appreciate it . '' .	You 'd come by the house and check it out .	if
0	122607	Paul lifted harold to his feet .	Steered him to the back exit .	and
0	24587	My nerves were shot i couldnt focus on anything , including breathing , but .	Personally i would never want any kind of label on that to protect me .	and
4	27104	Believe me . '' .	I say you 've been a sore spot between us all these years .	when
3	12763	I 'm not sure . '' .	She 'll like being in a tall condominium block .	if
2	119119	If anyone else had asked , maddy might have winced .	This was chase , and for whatever reason , she seemed to trust him .	but
2	83792	The old man regretted it lived off his fortune and was glad his name was no longer associated with the place that came to sell what he considered frippery .	Became apparent soon enough , and .	but
3	127023	Now what kind of friend would i be to dennis , tina said .	I stole his thunder .	if
0	56318	Seconds later our coordinates were programmed into the car .	We were speeding down winding back roads .	and
4	48770	And they call them war criminals .	They should be hailed .	when
0	124594	Groaning with a pain they all felt , scorpio pushed himself up .	Went to fang to examine his left leg , which had been injured .	and
0	110209	The corridor it revealed was pitch-black .	Reeked of death and decay .	and
4	69953	Someone not coughing into their elbow .	Especially they have gonorrhea of the throat as their sore throat very scary .	when
2	105510	The graininess was gone .	The mans face was in shadow , giving them precious little more than they already had on him .	but
3	109191	They may be dissuaded from pursuing us .	They see what happened to their comrades .	if
0	41942	He smiled sheepishly said brightly , the orb and the one who sought it are both destroyed , my lady .	Greeted them as courteously as he could in a supine position .	and
2	122771	She was a blunt , direct person .	Right now , the very last thing she wanted was to discuss her feelings .	but
4	126009	I gripped his shoulder and forced him to face me .	He began muttering about writing an article for a national medical journal .	when
2	3043	My last experience with the backdoor entrance had been uncomfortable , even painful at .	I still wanted to try it .	but
2	27619	I start to recoil .	He only seems more eager to kiss me as his tongue slips deep inside my mouth .	but
4	102368	Way they always do .	She thinks too hard .	when
1	64542	He refuses to be near me at night . '' .	He 's afraid he 's dangerous .	because
0	39695	Timidly , almost clumsily , the assassin strode over to the crown prince .	Kissed him on the cheek .	and
2	102080	She tried to give me a smile with her little tease .	I could see it was still hard for her .	but
2	114005	The big man might be strong enough to break the laser .	She doubted it would fire , as it must be wired into the peacemaker 's power source .	but
3	49233	I might provoke her ex .	I follow her home .	if
3	56290	We might be able to find you a doctor .	We act in the coming year .	if
3	86573	That must be a small paradise on earth .	I can believe bramaud 's stories .	if
0	144553	When to add the milk .	How sweet it should be .	and
0	44994	She scooped up the biggest slice .	Put it on jacks plate .	and
4	79528	The bells and beeps from the machines attached to cory 's body remained with him for the next three days whenever he closed his eyes .	He left cory 's room .	when
2	47647	I really didnt know .	I told myself you cant have everything .	but
2	85107	Agent reis , thank you for bringing my things . '' .	I have to get to work .	but
2	75295	I argue with her .	In truth , i will try anything she suggests .	but
0	32563	The couches were leather , an espresso machine waited by the receptionist 's desk .	Samples of materials , colors , and tiles were mounted on mahogany displays .	and
0	123645	I had faltered at the last possible moment .	Nightmare had escaped me .	and
0	108779	Accuracy had dropped off markedly once the seven hundred meter threshold had been crossed .	There were few who could deliver precise hits at over eight hundred .	and
0	56071	Jaime breathed through the pain ignored it .	Her wolf lunged at her confines , but .	and
3	76359	I would have gladly left it .	It would have left me .	if
4	83599	I felt an enormous sense of accomplishment .	I placed the last piece of wood in the rings .	when
2	37525	He invaded my personal space .	I soaked him up .	but
2	102022	Human beings had always been self absorbed .	In ancient times they had the benefit of being able to see a different point of view : what does the cat see .	but
0	95920	Getting in the pickup .	Driving from the hell he left behind .	and
2	59412	This morning it had been two layers of whitest linen , with strips of whalebone sewn between and dainty puffed sleeves attached .	Now it was soaked with salt water and brown from the sand and flotsam of the bay .	but
2	101977	To missing things , people , having a purpose .	This time , it would be worse .	but
0	90052	Another limousine was parked right in the middle of the hangar when they landed .	Yet another parade of uniformed guards as well as two airport officials waited for them below .	and
0	36724	He nipped at my bottom lip , sucking it into his mouth .	His tongue swiped against it , gliding sensually in a heated caress .	and
3	13230	Even a dove , which is one of the creators most gentle things , must consume life .	It is to live .	if
4	5756	I close my eyes and squeal .	He grabs a handful of my ass and pulls me tightly against him .	when
0	143670	I was certain the woman would take one look at me finish the job then and .	Know that her poison had failed .	and
2	135950	Sometimes i 'd see annmarie or grace or bo or noah around campus .	I avoided them as much as possible .	but
2	60443	I 'm sure you see a lot of that kind of thing in your work . '' .	It 's not something that 's happened in our family , young lady .	but
3	114753	`` , raven , you know what i feel for you . '' .	You can touch my mind .	if
4	58799	Later , gray taught jewel how to best defend herself .	Their passion was sated .	when
2	102696	He was totally preoccupied with this new life he was planning ; and : discussing every aspect , and discovering every detail of this venture .	Near every free moment was spent in conference with estaban .	but
0	2104	They had camped near the jehannah road .	Would cross it on the morrow to continue .	and
0	35156	She did not know what they were .	Did not want to know .	and
2	107954	`` our simulations are solid , and .	We ran several lab cultures with infected cells .	but
0	102608	Who is robin ? '' .	When did you get a message from him .	and
3	133171	He might even start believing in him .	Om was going to hand them out like this .	if
4	44174	Flinn was in jail .	Sam was attacked the other night .	when
4	102553	Making it impossible for her to open the door .	She reached the bulkhead she found a young oak tree lying across it .	when
2	122049	When he got on the bus , she was already sitting in their seat .	Sitting in his spot , against the wall .	but
3	151164	She wont meet me today .	I dont answer a question .	if
3	116780	God , please let lucien be with him .	Ian really was in trevor gaines 's house .	if
2	83044	Knowing i was chancing getting caught , i leaned further over the rack .	My elbow clipped the top row , and the whole thing rained down like a hailstorm .	but
2	62913	I 'd been happy during the ball itself .	Only i 'd forgotten myself in the whirl .	but
0	66900	A pair of red storm of the century 371 galoshes stand beside it .	Placed around their toes like a collar is a mae west .	and
0	63731	Breaking the leather of my pants .	Burning my skin beneath it .	and
2	54740	`` call me crazy ... . '' .	Yes , i still trust her .	but
0	57048	The cool wind rufed her hair and cloak .	She thought she felt a few tiny raindrops on her cheek .	and
0	136323	He paused a brief time .	Then entered a large wooden door .	and
4	152362	She thought to name all of the children .	She wrote to us .	when
0	50589	My knees were a little unsteady .	He had to keep his hand on my arm for a moment , before i could stand on my own .	and
0	85300	When he 'd met simone .	Thrown her into her car .	and
2	118742	Accidental soldering iron burns were in the past .	Looking for the right parts was still hard .	but
2	25281	Nevin , himself , was initially disturbed by zaels plan that many men would die .	The gilsum soldiers were as yet unseen and nevins concern over their fate was stifled by his need to see to their own safety .	but
0	72469	Naturally , i went to the museum .	Saw rembrants most famous painting , the night watch .	and
0	88535	Avel waved his hands .	The fees instantly lifted off cover and into a whirling cloud above him .	and
0	126297	But this was not small .	The pain was shearing , burning .	and
1	148979	Let me filter out the radio and the backround noise .	Her levels need to be a tad higher .	because
2	119677	Noah looks mildly surprised .	Says , no problem .	but
0	133224	The chip will dissolve .	You will return to your normal state .	and
2	157618	It was entertaining to see the first time .	There is no way i am ever going to look like that .	but
0	5462	Attempting to stall for time , he kicked dirt on her .	Then he yanked at her skirt , tugging it .	and
4	150343	You 'll know if any of them match any of the game pieces , right .	You meet the team .	when
2	131140	It was pretty brutal to watch .	He somehow managed to pull out a win .	but
3	142713	He 'd find a place to get some condoms .	He was in luck .	if
3	143305	Going to give yourself .	You dont stop glaring .	if
2	10223	She was in the car with someone , a man i think .	He didnt make it out .	but
3	21907	You will go nowhere in life .	You keep this attitude and behavior .	if
2	78448	That samantha was still missing , and maybe she would 've been able to let cassie drop i could n't . .	Stuck wherever cassie was .	but
0	86167	`` watch me , '' she said .	Strode stiffly to the revolving door .	and
3	64691	`` and what would you have done ? '' .	You walked in on us being lovers , ma petite .	if
3	130786	I would rather not see you .	You cant accept it and support me in the choice i have made .	if
0	98956	Connor was slow on his feet lazier than usual , but .	With most of the packing already done , they made ready to break camp .	and
3	106454	I started down the ladder .	I stood there much longer i 'd get forcibly shoved into the black pit .	if
0	89938	Were breaking the law .	Obviously , if we get caught , were screwed .	and
0	156244	Jana lay in zane 's arms , her eyes closed , her breath slow and easy .	She forced her body to stay relaxed .	and
2	4549	Her baby was with the bakers .	Things had gone the opposite of .	but
2	72085	As defective , renzo changed his schedule filing it at the usual time to avoid arousing his superior 's suspicion .	Going out to do the bird count before breakfast .	but
4	38742	She muttered something nasty , but i couldnt hear it over the tinny rev of the engine as we sped .	She wrapped her arms around my chest and realized i was laughing .	when
4	138656	The black scissors were in her hand and already snip-snip-snipping .	I heard a knock on the front door , and ginnie hempstock got up to answer it .	when
0	50303	Although he might outrank her , she would not enter the marriage as his inferior .	That was really all she had wanted .	and
0	100019	He was breathing heavily , as though he had gone to sleep .	Indeed , he slumped forward to a degree .	and
2	64193	I started to bolt from the restroom .	My iphone was vibrating crazily in my right pants pocket .	but
3	21255	And the tavern i had seen was the elephant and castles .	I was not mistaken we were in southwark .	if
2	62438	I jumped in to help her out .	She was exhausted and refused to move .	but
3	152830	I was a damp mess between my legs and i wondered .	He could smell me .	if
0	33087	Tahir took her hand to assist her in mounting oraden .	Steadied her as the unicorn rose to his feet .	and
0	74239	The insides of his nostrils were painfully dry .	When he sat up out of his bunk , he felt the cold at .	and
4	51266	As he always did , lucien left the procession .	His majesty approached the chapel .	when
4	82035	Never looked back i snuck a few .	She wasnt looking in the night .	when
1	14277	If she remained here , it would be .	She wanted to , not because adam dictated it .	because
0	78870	How a legionare thinks . '' .	Why he acts as he does .	and
4	118320	The smile slowly slipped .	She looked at jase .	when
0	108871	The automated transport then dutifully zipped up into the overhead traffic .	Went straight to her requested destination .	and
3	10238	She would have admitted that she wanted to see him .	She was truthful with herself , which she was being less and less these days .	if
0	48041	To be the wizards .	The white court being drawn into a closer alliance because of what he 's done .	and
2	40162	Well both have to attend every function .	Well be attending as family .	but
4	18553	`` it 's just sometimes i forget .	I 'm stressed and working .	when
2	34459	I 've never felt this way .	Then again , i 've never been with a girl like ashtyn .	but
4	122471	In fact , id been thinking .	Id accepted tylers cup that id tasted it to screen not just for alcohol , but for sugar .	when
1	83799	I shouldnt do it .	Sometimes they were unpredictable .	because
1	142267	Noah had decided to seize the moment and grab her .	He might not have another chance .	because
0	62634	`` maybe we should all get some rest . '' .	Try again in a few hours .	and
2	82401	I went to walk .	She held on to my arm .	but
0	74552	I took my lunch out of my bag , desperately wishing that i was n't . .	Headed back toward my usual loner spot .	and
2	68044	We caught up , sure .	A lot of it was because we had deepened our connection .	but
0	61377	Besides , the giant 's blood had already ruined it .	I imagined i 'd get the garment quite a bit more messy before the night was through .	and
0	20743	`` yes , '' she said ruefully , `` i am afraid she insisted .	Asked what i would do if someone did choose to come in .	and
0	30261	William did flips above them .	Billy saw past emilys shocked expression that he made her the happiest girl on earth .	and
0	116525	Too much going on .	He was stuck in this goddamn chair .	and
1	4330	You never know what eric could be good at .	You never give him a chance youre always all about that ferris kid .	because
4	130866	From the bar there was complete silence .	The perfectly dressed woman motioned to her .	when
0	114725	This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle 's back .	Cling between his wings .	and
4	22792	My head was deep in the fruity smelling cloud of powder .	I felt someone come on the bus and saw mickey heading for the back room .	when
0	72323	He 'd cleared away the debris of my burned kitchen so the builders could start working on the new one .	I 'd had to insist he take a fair wage for it .	and
2	128471	I appreciate my magic .	Saw no harm having a few toys for myself , just in case , and for pure fun .	but
2	21953	As she stared at her target 's retreating back , she could not help .	Think the swish of the crimson coat he wore to fend off the chill made his shoulders seem just a little bit reliable .	but
3	157833	Wed go out to red lobster .	Maybe he was feeling really adventurous .	if
0	144526	To divide his troops .	Divert his men from guarding josh and the others .	and
0	23445	Nissa went straight to him .	Wrapped her arms around his neck .	and
0	30101	They slipped into a small tavern .	Searched for seats among the crush of people .	and
2	59181	Would have liked to do the same .	Traylor keeps him busy with incessant question asking .	but
0	46683	She flopped down on the bed .	Looked up at the ceiling .	and
0	79261	He had the basketball in his hands .	He smiled at her .	and
0	103850	Let the leader know your fury .	They shall not return .	and
0	154585	Pinning the sack down with one paw .	Rubbing his whiskers all over it .	and
0	40664	Im not going to spend the next ten years of my life in prison , pam said .	Clicked the unlock button on her door .	and
2	102259	Then i remembered , jondriss body lying on the cavern floor , i tried to get up .	A great dizziness came over me and i started to weep , gentle hands coaxed me to lie back down , serinaes voice whispered , whoa , mini just take it .	but
2	36850	She 'd returned with the video .	Apparently had been so shaken by something that had occurred within the clan that she left directly after .	but
2	145058	I turned back to titus .	He was well into the recovery stage by now and honestly it looked like eden and kiran were dealing with the situation just fine .	but
1	96833	The wounded percussionist must have become firmly entangled with some of the equipment .	The strain on the line was extraordinary .	because
0	50797	My neighbors might have been shady , but at least they were generous and condoned safe sex .	Not passed a background check if one was required to live .	and
1	46047	Oh , and you might want to time this whole thing with your weather . '' .	If it happens to rain , the earth will be washed away and then you 're shit out of luck-worse if it happens to rain after you 've already trapped it .	because
2	16243	I saw where he had been , and , and saw the body off in the middle of the trees .	I turned my car in the road in that direction .	but
0	69704	`` a disfigured woman has little chance to attract lovers .	The loss of even an insincere one is most painful .	and
2	98807	One unlucky visit shed tried to hide in the ladies room .	He was nothing if not dogged , and hed sent another woman in to get her .	but
2	157867	Desperate to find the ubiquitous robed men with chicken-scratched signs , she scanned the crowd .	Only saw people that looked like herselflike her neighbors back home .	but
2	90110	He 'd tried to separate olaf and himself into one team , and bernardo and me into another .	Olaf had put his oversized foot .	but
3	31046	He countered softly , getting the last word in .	Only i could get you to comply to my wishes .	if
1	97409	But she did stop to catch her breath when she was halfway down the block .	Her limbs refused to take another step for fear of her lungs collapsing .	because
3	130187	Can paint a vision of truth in sense and touch .	The worlds once rendered in a fleeting moment of joy and lust .	if
2	17046	I do trust your cane .	I do not trust you .	but
3	22478	`` and , i 'm going to be very pissed off . '' .	I start to sprout horns and a tail in the next few weeks .	if
0	39919	You ladies take her in .	Put her to bed .	and
0	63742	Melissa climbed from the bath .	Began towelling herself dry .	and
3	37689	I would like to kill that sort of english .	I had a claymore .	if
4	79841	It took me forever to get used to the noise . '' .	I moved to seattle .	when
0	13435	The chamber was hot .	The heat of the gathered fae spread out below us there must have been thousands of them down there was only making it worse .	and
2	55822	In the absence of any real reference point outside , it was impossible to judge how quickly they were moving .	Progress seemed slow to morrison .	but
0	1175	Dimarico handled the passports , while the rest of them fielded questions from the other two .	Dealt with the senior officer .	and
3	25063	... '' howard looked down at his hands .	You could see the hospital .	if
4	88214	Who had taunted him .	He 'd been held prisoner .	when
0	136480	The next week , he engaged a lawyer .	Began the process of dissembling his former life .	and
1	107885	The christian god or the neo-wiccan `` goddess '' would probably never gain an actual form too encompassing .	The beliefs of their faithful were too varied and their power was too nebulous .	because
3	126717	Time enough , to inform his superiors and collect his deserved reward-escape from ardsmuir ; a posting back to civilization .	The gold were found .	if
0	40820	She 's close to garroway .	Is part of the pack .	and
0	146220	There was a crackle of lightning outside .	Rain began pouring down the windows like tears .	and
3	119788	Who would snap into action .	A fly happened by .	if
2	134681	It was still hot out .	A desperate chill was traveling through her body .	but
4	131607	*** , alerac 's gaze went straight to the stream .	He broke from the trees .	when
2	72541	When she 'd awakened and stared up at him with her sexy violet eyes , he 'd become harder than he 'd ever been in his life and .	Could no more have stopped himself from tasting and touching her than he could stop the sun from rising in the east each morning .	but
3	124119	I imagine hed be making video games .	Money was his thing .	if
4	64621	The best things happen .	You stop making plans and follow your heart .	when
2	91192	Mothers often worry about their children .	Jack could not remember the last time he had been a cause of deep worry to his mother .	but
0	47018	That he proceeded down the line .	Greeted each one according to protocol .	and
2	64036	The man abandoned the mirror .	Continued rubbing as he stepped into the closet and then emerged with one of tachyon 's coats .	but
2	73161	Not just he was strong .	He carried himself like a master of control-whether they were people or animals .	but
2	130546	The thing refused to take any shape in the darkness .	It was heading toward me faster now , its body spitting out gravel to both sides .	but
2	69067	`` bitte , mein herr , '' norbert steiner began .	Then he , too , saw the red star , and became silent .	but
3	53580	Freeman could certainly produce it without someone being forced to steal it .	The will was filed away and gathering dust .	if
3	82357	And , i would be the first to tell you .	I could find an explanation for what she sees and hears .	if
2	27712	She lifted her arms .	They came up slowly , sluggishly , and her fingers stayed half-closed , like a sleepy child 's .	but
0	39094	She folded the two sheets of paper .	Placed one on gretchens desk just as the bell rang to end recess .	and
2	26016	Grants hair was a shade darker than her own blonde .	His had a curl to it .	but
2	35362	Gideon signaled peter to stay put .	His friend was already moving .	but
1	85022	Snow slanted down through the porch light , abigail figuring the full thirty milligrams of percoset must be raging through her her thoughts derailing and becoming unmanageable .	She was so stoned , so detached .	because
0	87279	Any small sound would prick her attention .	She would turn her head to see where it had come from .	and
3	84508	It 's football , stuart .	You got a ticket out of .	if
2	44113	They were of course aware of this .	Didnt dare to speak or act against it .	but
1	75363	Had only gone intothe caf early that morning .	She was going to meet up with her friend millie .	because
0	26968	To keep my family safe .	Stop all of the suffering .	and
2	17922	`` i would 've come up to see you . '' .	I just got back from having a few days .	but
4	48891	How as wonderful it was being in the middle of a huge forest .	You were a wolf .	when
2	147288	The middle third might get me a chair before 200 .	I retire at 250 i have no chance at promotion to the admiral council .	but
0	59216	He lifted her hand .	Pressed a small coin into her palm .	and
4	77362	Was wearing to nibble his way from my neck to shoulder .	He pressed himself against me and moved the collar of his shirt i .	when
0	31442	This controller is your enemy .	The midwest leaders especially are not averse to helping you with this hunt .	and
3	142198	Your employer would react .	It got out that you were being investigated for embezzlement .	if
4	98554	They approached the plate , which now had an eight-inch-diameter hole burned through it .	It was done reacting .	when
4	111543	It was right after pentecost , because of fear .	The paraclete descended upon the disciples , who were at the time hiding out .	when
0	99949	Suddenly the pushing stopped .	The shouts and screams of battle died .	and
2	92208	She thinks they are heading to sit with them .	He pulls her towards the left to the empty corner in the back .	but
4	99990	That had crashed over him .	He 'd first encountered her barely clad body .	when
2	146339	We rarely actually see them ; i guess youd call it .	Every once in a while , we get a feeling .	but
0	7370	No wrapping going on .	He was losing patience .	and
3	15061	Wondered , just in case .	I should have put the sim card in a ziplock .	if
1	151287	Him to join them very tempting .	Not least they enjoyed more generous research funding .	because
3	103779	You 'd see me .	I put my name on the proposal .	if
0	27022	Dagger will get back home .	He will probably be brought up as a guardian .	and
0	65008	My senses blurred , making me feel disoriented .	Then my surroundings clarified .	and
3	138595	I suspect some kind of fatal accident would have befallen us , but we were both smart enough to stick with our fifth amendment right to remain silent .	Either of us had cracked .	if
0	123403	I shall be chief detective .	You can be my sidekick .	and
2	3838	Slayer came for him then the wolves arrived .	Gaul jumped back , and .	but
2	135361	Perhaps it wasnt the first time .	There was something about this particular win that called him to tell me about it .	but
2	49956	I just had you . '' .	I need to be inside you .	but
3	27368	There was nothing in the world-least of all donald ' s own will-to prevent the robot piping up to contradict kresh .	The complex admixture of first law potentials broke the wrong way .	if
2	27707	I had tried more than once to direct one of those earth-shattering smiles my way .	She hardly glanced at me .	but
2	77155	She expected it to hurt .	It did n't . .	but
4	65702	I can do that .	Im , you know a ghost .	when
3	98168	Cantala youre thinking , so youre next best option is the stairs .	You sprinted for the lift itll take far too long before it arrives here on the roof .	if
2	155217	She started to get up .	Her mother stopped her .	but
2	8537	It broke up for many reasons .	It all boiled down to personality conflicts .	but
2	80411	I 've always wanted to .	Could never dream of affording it .	but
0	14098	All you have been spending an awful lot of my money .	We do have our own little secret .	and
2	24871	She paused a moment , struck by a faint wave of regret as she remembered following the trail in italy , with nathan by her side .	The feeling was soon pushed .	but
3	20182	And , then so be it .	That meant a spot of witch-hunting .	if
0	135358	Katie sat back in her seat and said .	Looked out her side window .	and
2	140161	Now in this second reliving , i waited for just a moment longer and .	Weighed the consequences in my mind .	but
0	60824	There was never more than one disappearance per year .	Not all years had one .	and
0	36486	He took a dozen water sacks .	Over flew it at night .	and
0	88665	Now he had his arms crossed and , looking at her .	Was leaning back against the wall .	and
0	102851	The slaves were being previewed , across the small stage down the other side .	Walked in long rows up one flight of stairs .	and
1	137983	They talked about it remarkably little , even among themselves .	There seemed no way to express the terrifying magnificence of it .	because
0	95504	When he saw me standing inside the gate he paled .	Had my shoulder in an instant was hauling me back onto the main staircase .	and
2	48219	I 'm an accessory , i guess . '' .	I tried to help .	but
4	132203	I requested my fake eye to be white , so everyone sorta knew i couldnt see through that eye .	The dudes at the hospital took my eye .	when
2	47520	To offer honored guests .	Fouled food like this .	but
4	95971	But the strangest of all was .	She dreamed something terrible happening to her and then it would come out in the news of having actually happened to someone in the near vicinity .	when
4	81033	Occasionally picking up speed .	They all moved at .	when
0	58123	I had convinced the judge that lilly was not receiving the proper food .	Being denied her anxiety medicine from when mom and dad died .	and
3	22163	What would he do .	He knew she carried another man 's child .	if
2	102728	Even know her name .	They all wanted to help her .	but
2	116845	So few people knew he was drunk .	Emma could always tell .	but
4	157669	But its hard that feel so good my brain is imagining them .	Hes this close and his mouth and teeth and tongue are doing things to my neck .	when
2	97824	Were welcome to entertain his guests .	Only one night is no use .	but
2	87809	His polished , colorful armor is classic superhero .	It stands out in this grey and dusty war zone .	but
4	13252	Past the smooth , jutting head of his penis , then lower still , he exhaled a pleading oath .	She tugged his pants down lower .	when
2	158851	Magog cleared his throat .	Fw took the question .	but
4	96149	I squealed with delight .	I saw that it was done in my favorite colors-pink and black-and gerbera daisies .	when
0	72398	The ognok nodded his head , the hope and hero for the dark destroyers .	Trotted off in pursuit of thetra eouhjasson .	and
3	38206	And you could be hurt .	You were beside me .	if
2	95898	The air around them seemed to shift .	Then i realized what was really happening .	but
3	116691	To tell him about the others .	Especially we 're gon na continue to see each other and sleep together like this .	if
2	147103	Survival has its limits .	Each of us knows well , now , that grief does .	but
4	25014	If he was surprised at sleeping outside , he was even more surprised .	Brynn drew her hand down and began to undress him .	when
0	22699	Then , also , she was friendly with lady galman .	What he wrote would certainly reach edith 's ears .	and
2	123849	His bite is death i .	No sound came out .	but
4	78295	To soften her approach .	She heard the doctor loudly hang up .	when
3	134201	I will kill you .	You hurt the girl .	if
0	112601	The corners of his lips quirked upward , straight into his body , taking us both down to the ground .	I answered his question and his amusement by diving out of the tree .	and
0	81552	Too spreading burning diesel over the dock .	Spreading the fire to boats on the other side of the dock .	and
4	150491	Fuck around with lana two seconds .	You could come out of the bedroom at any second and see me .	when
2	120680	Part of mcferguss mind regretted not talking to sampson more about possible motives for the murder .	Another part figured the young man had already been through most of the obvious ones and had decide the youth would just have been annoyed by talking about it .	but
0	124957	If she was all prepared to be honest with herself , she could sleep with boston and .	Be alright when it was time for him to leave .	and
3	13978	The man believed it but anyway , he would pretend what things she was saying by politeness and for the peaces sake what was necessary to continue the interview .	He didnt believe it because of were already here , tell a little bit about what way you met .	if
0	109509	When her eyes started to slide .	He held her gaze .	and
0	83716	He urged us to take the drug .	I must say that i considered it .	and
0	57643	She caught it in midair , using carpathian strength to sever the head , all in one movement .	Came down in a slashing motion .	and
4	94690	I almost protest , biting my lip to keep from doing .	He straightens and begins to back .	when
2	58913	Maybe the man lacked refinement , as ethan 's father would say .	He was a valuable tool .	but
0	81318	She swallowed to clear the lump in her throat . '' .	Finished , `` before i turned into a vampire .	and
1	94051	I 'm afraid to look for rose or ryke in the crowds .	I may lose sight of lo .	because
4	59961	He left me the house in the will , didnt he .	My so-called father died .	when
4	153095	That her father had suffered .	Her mother had died .	when
0	104541	He had issues with breaking .	Entering a few years .	and
1	36848	I again ignored elvira .	The hot guy crew hit our table and i was busy leaning forward and breathing in their general direction .	because
2	46247	We both knew it was a lie .	The alternative , eating with them , wasnt an option .	but
4	145766	To sacrifice the behemoth .	He shoots at the ring .	when
3	98423	He could be made to find out.perhaps there was a way , after all .	That liar did not know wherefitzpatrick was .	if
2	2834	She seemed to be out of breath .	Smiling , the low-hanging ornate lamp behind her giving her hair an angelic orange glow .	but
2	23669	Salena pulled her arm away and salena was called by lea .	Started to slide away from lea .	but
0	89948	Paul realized his vulnerability so close to so many agents .	Remembered the magurs previous advice .	and
4	70460	Lucas pulled his jacket up and the injury disappeared from her area of vision .	She finished binding the scarf with a tight knot .	when
0	4805	He rolled his eyes upward , the green turned to darkness by the moonlight .	They were huge and almond shaped .	and
2	11955	Your brother promised me a bride . '' .	He sold me a whore .	but
2	85943	I hate her choices , so i let it be .	I also know how fragile she is .	but
2	150900	No , goblins might be easily controlled .	They were far too stupid .	but
2	36896	She had a huge stockpile of the medication .	Either it ran out or she trashed it or used it up .	but
0	87192	I 'm going to find the pontoon-slashing motherfuckers who did this to us . '' .	Then we 'll figure out what to do .	and
0	144107	There was not much of anything for several miles around ; they had covered a good ten miles of country , even flying the tedious sweeps , since their camp that morning .	Even if the man had wanted to run away from them , there was nowhere he might have run away to .	and
3	106271	Done with this record deal .	It means i 'm losing your trust .	if
2	128054	Tristan was a rumbling volcano .	Only katie could feel the earthquake beneath her feet .	but
0	15854	After pigeon sweet-talked the officer , trevor climbed out .	Nate resumed the excavation .	and
4	49455	The laughter came to a sudden halt .	Adrian realized that nobody else had joined him .	when
0	21046	She stood up , folder in her hand .	Walked toward us , a haughty look aimed at scout .	and
2	24724	Her words stung him .	He could not bring himself to repudiate what she was saying .	but
4	160575	It was an awkward , back-patting , several-feet-of-space-between-us kind of hug .	We saw each other as adults .	when
2	34933	I know intensive care sounds scary . '' .	I think being monitored there after a heart attack would be standard care , regardless of the severity .	but
2	127623	Strategies abound for advancing in the game .	The mainframe makes it impossible to develop a clear path to the top rankings .	but
3	5977	In truth the cross might just sit .	The vampire didnt try to use powers on me .	if
3	11865	He might insist on accompanying the couple to provide protection .	The guard recognized her .	if
0	15882	I felt tears start to burn .	Wiped them away with shaking hands .	and
2	64602	Bickel was both a minuscule and vulnerable creature .	Beyond that , he contained powers that could stretch across any universe .	but
1	127010	I always laugh at the term natural-looking makeup .	That look seems to take me longer than the halloween clown face id put on every year to look like a cheetah .	because
4	12311	Who was not much good at lying .	Faced with a direct question .	when
2	107955	Toryn followed after the other two .	I didnt watch him go any further than past the outer gate .	but
3	73253	He must be a good man .	A servant truly loves his master .	if
2	99916	We 'll take a little break now ... she can talk to giraffes .	Stay tuned for parker 's one on one interview with the mississippi woman who claims .	but
2	32696	Now was as good a time as any he was uneasy .	Billy sees yachi across the room , he should approach him and .	but
3	111886	What he would do .	I tried to make a break for it .	if
0	110255	Claude was pushing it .	Though hunter was enjoying it , his grin was looking a little tense .	and
2	131303	He 'd once intended to become a professor of mathematics realized he had a knack for writing and ended up becoming a columnist for scientific american , where he often debunked the allegedly supernatural .	He 'd grown up in queens as the youngest of six in an irish-italian family and .	but
2	121829	Speaking would do nothing .	Get me a mouth full of water .	but
4	54510	He 'd found two bugs in his bunk room .	He 'd first reached the compound .	when
2	154226	I already checked her out .	If the pain persists , she should get an x-ray .	but
2	32772	Norman had not come up .	The boys never said sandra was a widow so i knew he might exist .	but
2	139292	I ran for the door when he hit the ground on his back .	He turned in time and seized my ankle .	but
4	117766	He is clearly something of a conspiracy nut .	I talked to him .	when
2	61424	I am useless on this battlefield .	I will fly just out of range and crush any outside sentries if all fails .	but
1	16986	Sure , this report always seems to be right on .	You make it that way .	because
2	27736	Benedict opened his mouth to speak .	Agatha interrupted , `` and benedict , do be sure that lady katherine is brought back to the house .	but
4	158346	How rian must have felt .	He had to wait for me to get done with my interrogation two days .	when
2	156882	I try to take another step and lunge out of the pool .	Of course he 's got me by the arm , so i slip .	but
2	92241	I know it makes no sense . '' .	I do love him and i want to stay with him .	but
2	60654	Her expression said that she was searching for some meaning in what i 'd said .	She was finding none .	but
1	74705	All of us , mythical creatures , should be taking .	I have learned that we are stronger as a group than as individuals , especially when the dark forces come to claim us .	because
0	99054	It was mid winter .	A southerly gale was rattling on the windows while the temperature hovered around freezing .	and
0	77606	To combat the rain and sharp , bitter wind , i create a fire using magic .	We huddle around it , capes and cloaks pulled over our heads , shivering from the damp and cold .	and
3	52637	This was the kind of information that people would share with her over time or that she would need to elicit from them to provide the service-this very unique service-that the threesome sitting across the booth from her was proposing .	She actually started this company , if this really went through .	if
2	90589	Chris continued to stare .	Realized after a moment he was just being rude .	but
2	148535	Patch gizmo may not be illegal , said the beefy cop .	Can you prove to us that you have the proper authorization to distribute these gadgets in the state of oregon .	but
0	89734	When the wookiee put her down , scarlet gestured to the r3 unit .	The two of them left .	and
3	33819	I wanted to be holding my babies .	It was the end of the world .	if
0	51153	Sean rolled from jared .	Fought this new attack .	and
0	13365	He flipped the lock on the screen door .	Pulled it open a little .	and
4	11310	You 're crashing back to reality .	You really burn through gravity-when .	when
2	160107	The woman had already dialed and .	Was holding the phone to her ear .	but
4	38566	How sad lucas looked .	He appeared to her in a dream .	when
1	78921	She loved the studio .	A dutch artist she admired , karel appel , had once lived in the same building .	because
3	23147	It would be just as well , : not that we are not perfectly comfortable as we are .	We got back the rest of our crew .	if
2	34523	He says , breaking the odd silence , i will not say i understand what you went through because i probably dont .	Believe me when i say that you have my sympathies .	but
3	22583	I would be expelled from the program .	I kept missing classes .	if
0	41972	I lowered my wrist , wrapping them around my neck so he pulled me closer .	Took hold of his hands .	and
2	121414	I know what you mean .	Man , we 'll have a good future once we graduate .	but
3	115853	It would be so much better .	They could be ... more .	if
4	142767	To take me with him squirrel hunting .	We visited them in the country .	when
1	149407	Probably walking his bike .	He 's just ... so ... tiyyy-urd .	because
0	98594	To be anything but us two , but i needed to let go .	Now it was more .	and
0	119230	The only city we 've been able to hold without any luxen is d.c. , but silver spring are all almost completely under their control . '' .	The invaders are amassing tremendous forces around the city-alexandria , arlington , mount rainier .	and
2	148195	Isabel snorted , although she lagged slightly behind .	Followed him without protest .	but
2	150205	She can be a little much .	Shes got a good heart .	but
2	115871	It seemed to me it would be quite difficult to write a sermon without private space where you could concentrate .	He seemed to be fine with it , always open for interruptions .	but
2	65090	He tensed it was a british soldier , facedown in the mud and clearly dead , his legs swaying in the current .	A glimpse of red caught his eye and .	but
4	87283	You 'll read about that in the short story entitled `` not the end '' .	I release the vuduri companion later this year .	when
4	2319	It had been a little over a week ago , holding onto me .	The man had been weeping in my arms .	when
0	143171	In the past week she had been stalked by a werewolf .	Kidnapped by a vampire .	and
2	155023	Flen was sure it was just a mistwraith impersonating her .	I had to let her in .	but
1	47952	Normally she felt safe in her home .	The house had such thick walls .	because
2	4142	I assumed it was an ashtray .	I couldnt actually see an ashtray .	but
0	38905	The hair on her forehead was damp .	Her legs were trembling from the position .	and
2	31569	He sometimes wondered if a good fight would help their marriage .	It took two to fight .	but
2	80349	I know i can not afford to keep denying those statements that are all the utmost truth any longer .	It is necessary to add they are also not for me .	but
2	79826	The curtains were closed , and .	She 'd been so wrapped up in max and hank and making sure they both were .	but
2	58848	The sons of finwe were feanor , and fingolfin , and finarfin .	The mother of feanor was miriel serinde , whereas the mother of fingolfin and finarfin was indis of the vanyar .	but
3	99468	Security footage would have been able to show us .	Someone had swapped out the painting .	if
0	25496	He was as naked as a newborn .	His skin was as black as the night .	and
4	41852	But brynna had also been gone for a very long time , from the time i was thirteen to the present .	She had begun to warm .	when
2	124210	Alexis , you talk about matthew and the pain of losing him .	Didnt you lose your friends .	but
0	99290	They turned at the sound of my voice .	Smiled blankly at me .	and
2	1819	I open my mouth , about to let out a string of sincere apologies .	Her arms fling around my shoulders and she pulls me into a big , sisterly hug .	but
2	109522	There 'd been a couple of steady dates in college and rachel had captivated him .	One relationship he thought was serious in law school .	but
2	62088	Maria felt so benevolent .	Part of me agreed with the spiteful gertrudethat 's right , that was her name .	but
4	48445	29 talie i was .	I woke the next morning .	when
4	15393	The general tried to speak again `` ares , i hope you understood why i kept you away from field work and basically locked you within the confines of this institution , but i only did that to keep you safe .	The moment of silence dawned a little too heavily on us .	when
0	74854	The group seemed reluctant to answer my question .	There was sadness in drakes eyes .	and
0	65192	When the fifths had quieted .	All the attention turned to sato .	and
4	52761	He did echoed the gesture .	I raised my eyebrows .	when
4	151442	That he felt safe .	Cohen the barbarian was .	when
0	142902	Which means getting you to idlewilde .	Reuniting you with your friends .	and
0	82294	Just reached to one side .	Handed me another pair of those paper-thin shoe-covers .	and
3	58474	Stop screwing around and be with him .	Jacob makes you happy .	if
4	96800	His heart missed a beat : a shadowy figure was coming toward him , slowly , in the rain .	He turned to the right .	when
4	8570	He recognized her , because he gave her a nod .	She came into the room .	when
2	63334	His new boss 's magnificent speal had completely dazzled his mind .	His descent to reality was hastened by an immediate encounter with rees .	but
4	41401	But , there was no sign of kanin in the room beyond .	Zeke opened the door a few seconds .	when
0	53496	Ah , yes , keira thought to herself , you see someone who is in every way your superior .	You dont like it .	and
0	158128	He puckered his lips .	Noisily sucked some of the cold water into his mouth .	and
4	87121	To go after a tasty treat .	He could simply stand in front of the refrigerator and meow .	when
3	151317	And , it may be just you say , that they are overworked , and in despair .	Other police dont do that .	if
2	84891	She had the wrinkled eyes of a smoker .	The wrinkles were no match for the thick layer of foundation babe caulked on every morning .	but
0	39029	He 'd grown his winter coat .	Was staying in a room that was much too warm for him .	and
4	34749	Getting to know a newbie .	She 'd be history next week .	when
4	118182	My throat suddenly felt as if i swallowed dust .	My fingers brushed his .	when
2	143266	The p-51 went airborne briefly as it struck a wave and bounced .	Then fell with a powerful splash .	but
3	106145	Someone who would falsely implicate another with information not widely known is likely trying to shift blame for his own actions .	Particularly the person talking had a ... well , shall we say , an affect ... that indicated not just deceit , but a certain level of scheming .	if
2	68472	Billy goes to the major and the major says that it isnt a long one , just out to a couple of villages and then back , so what can go wrong .	Tries to talk him out of letting schnelling go into the field .	but
2	77079	Our mommies all need a check-up .	They dont want an avashay or tarrish physician to know about our newest family members until their husbands know .	but
2	93042	I knew it was pointless .	I tried to fend her off .	but
4	81948	Organizing popular resistance against them .	He was imprisoned and tortured by the right-wing colonels .	when
4	158448	She caught her breath .	His palms slid back and forth over her nipples making them harden .	when
3	87255	Then maybe the corruption would finally end .	The rebels managed to overthrow the government .	if
1	65922	A certain warming to him .	I had seen emotions in him that i understood .	because
0	50044	* * * * * abbey stood .	Watched bill , jeff , and paul argue their situation with the receptionist and two heavyset security guards .	and
2	133749	Dont know what it is .	I think the grays are in control of my body , my mind , all of my movements .	but
2	98808	He was a straw-brained , long-winded , skirt-chasing rascal .	He was my best pal .	but
4	85130	Someone could be walking along , minding his business .	Hed receive a little surprise shower .	when
3	66006	Bow , then we would all be equally embarrassed .	We were all naked or stripped to our underclothes .	if
2	20387	We all had our sequences .	How did we manage when we had to break choreo and wing it .	but
0	99564	The men following adus were shabbily dressed .	Carried a variety of weapons , rusty swords , axes , and spiked maces .	and
2	17065	Maybe he 'd balked when she told him to shut her in the bathroom and turn off the lights .	He 'd done it .	but
0	128309	`` i 'll take care of it , '' roshan said .	Vince felt a sudden surge of preternatural power flow through the air .	and
4	106968	Sunlight poured into the tent .	A soldier flipped back its animal skin front , causing them to squint as they peered out .	when
2	111869	Not to think about it .	Dreadful thoughts kept coming .	but
0	121288	It was hot salty , and .	When he ejaculated in his pants , he was hardly aware of it , any more than he was aware of her screaming against his hard palm .	and
0	88872	Someone grabbed my long , tangled , brown hair pulled me upright .	I tried to get to my feet , to run away again , but .	and
2	2776	Two of the screens on the wall above had just gone blank .	Daedalus continued to climb .	but
2	136997	It used to be such a delight to see them .	Today she focused in on it , closed one eye , and pretended to crush the balloon between her thumb and pointer finger .	but
2	86994	They could hear men yelling in the distance .	Were unable to make out any actual words .	but
2	124791	I 'd assumed exes were always evil and to be avoided .	Connor considered her a friend and his friends should be my friends .	but
2	121813	Even i havent arrogated my power and influence to the extent of renaming my land the sir george estate .	There are those for whom pride knows no bounds .	but
2	46744	Cook raised an eyebrow .	She shook her head to let him know she could not tell him why .	but
4	25564	Then returned them to me .	She dropped her eyes for an instant .	when
0	159796	He 's learned to ride one of the smaller warhorses .	Already has a good seat .	and
2	108995	He would disclose when the time was right .	Guessed it had more to do with terzini and the fact that he was engineered in a very deliberate fashion that it did with moral rectitude .	but
0	86996	To get some action around .	He keeps gettin ' shot .	and
4	112291	`` lady john , '' he said , standing up .	He saw that i had noticed him .	when
2	107367	I was pretty sure he 'd heard me .	When a minute passed and still nothing , i wondered if i was wrong .	but
2	22253	The man had been brought to ishan to be healed .	He was too deep in delirium from a fever much like the one that had taken the life of ishans father .	but
2	1027	Say what you want about adam .	His friends are generous .	but
4	128511	The family was already on their way to financial security .	Their parents were killed in the accident .	when
2	70005	I would sing it .	I dont want to ruin the moment .	but
2	98270	I 'm not a child .	When i push away , i find i have little strength .	but
3	61399	What would we have done .	Jake hadnt had the accident .	if
1	148792	In college her roommate sometimes refused to go out in the evenings .	She thought her boyfriend might call .	because
2	124947	I have no recollection of anything suddenly being different in the world .	I do remember being vaguely aware of the birds chatter as they took wing .	but
0	6761	You guys go get armed .	Then find spots along the outside to protect the fences .	and
0	129761	The hut was empty .	His staff was missing .	and
0	89557	They would be having the sunbird of suntown for sunday lunch , to ensure that they had an appetite .	They might wish to avoid food the night .	and
0	128624	He had questions to answer .	Having him closed up in a carriage with her would be conducive to getting those answers .	and
4	93875	He saw behind the counter , a doorway without a door leading somewhere beyond .	He got to the back of the store .	when
4	67016	I see her lick her lips .	I let go and step around to her front .	when
0	115991	He reached down through the water to his pocket held them .	Withdrew two old , rusty nails .	and
0	140720	It did things on its own .	All you could do was watch in panic .	and
3	29956	I needed to vacuum the downstairs , do a load of my laundry , and go to the library .	I could tear myself away from the issue of my possibly impending death .	if
3	110755	`` , `` i told her .	He was a real wolf you would not be scratching his ears .	if
2	67187	How a man like dominic stayed out of jail was often a mystery to jake .	It was that unpredictable element about him that made him so successful in business .	but
0	78070	Maybe if they saw her , they 'd stop acting like juveniles .	Let her be the kid .	and
0	61432	Another small warrior came over to the dainty in command .	They began to speak .	and
1	11569	Squeeze my eyes shut and want to groan .	I sound like an idiot .	because
1	130768	In this moment , she felt lucky .	She was here with her friend .	because
0	16167	Pointing to the french doors , `` .	I remember a party once where people were actually dancing in here , and drifting out there on the terrace .	and
4	120672	You were so thin .	You were a boy .	when
3	65108	Katie 's warning was clear .	Even it did embarrass mari-keep .	if
2	57810	I understand the flight risk concern .	My client not only has no intention of leaving the country , i highly doubt he would be able to without being recognized .	but
0	53216	They 'd made their deal .	Now the hard part would begin .	and
4	58331	Walter looked at the crowd .	A few called to get on with it .	when
4	51564	A girl wears over her head on a day .	A misty sort of rain is falling .	when
4	117346	They would head for the transponder .	The rescue parties set out .	when
0	84030	Creating the perfect poison .	Loading it in the dart .	and
0	128374	I wrapped my arms around him .	Pressed my face into the slick warm cotton of his shirt .	and
3	43103	To buy anything new .	Especially not she was going to start worrying about the ethics of interpersonal relations between the living and the dead .	if
2	129172	You could tell it was lived in .	It was well maintained by people who cared about it .	but
2	139049	She wanted to argue .	She knew it was true .	but
4	61544	You fucking hit me .	My back was turned .	when
4	75462	The feelings of peace i had felt with herindeed .	I was thrown into the next room .	when
4	108201	His broken heart was in his voice . '' .	He replied , `` yes , josephine .	when
2	97633	I 'm pretty sure he 's faking it .	I grab a hold of this opportunity and take a chance at doing something i 've wanted to do since our time together in the rain on the roof in tennessee .	but
0	151003	Keeping the order of nothing .	Making sure it remained nothing .	and
0	34551	Shaking back her black hair , which was strangely ragged in places .	Looking up at him .	and
4	23272	I should have recognized your old mans attitude .	You gave it to me .	when
2	94595	Each was waiting for the other to speak .	None knew where to start .	but
2	147596	Brad flashed his small light through the limbs above him .	Saw only dark green pine needles and reddish-brown shaggy bark .	but
4	91869	How long till the day .	The last of you must say that , pete .	when
0	143511	She let magic flare from her hands .	Kept her eyes shut .	and
3	154777	To waste on rot gut whiskey .	Even i did i wouldnt give it to you .	if
2	114833	Well , doug was probably right in the first analysis . '' .	I wanted to see if i could head off any unpleasantness -- without involving you .	but
4	53371	His father had given him .	He came to manhood .	when
0	100358	I took a leave of absence from med school . '' .	Worked on it full time .	and
0	22800	To hide my eyes .	Set off for the parking lot .	and
1	85996	We 're not over , but another part , a bigger part of me is grateful .	I just want someone to go on pretending everything is okay with .	because
0	38012	Your kiss is honey , and i worship it . '' .	Your touch scorches like fire .	and
2	111116	To be permanent , there for him .	His parents were gone .	but
3	61064	You 'd be a serial killer .	You were in the civilian population .	if
0	36143	They insisted that emperor oviss had gathered all of the dwarfs that he could find .	Traveled secretly through the valtava forest into what is now known as hozekan .	and
1	80938	You tell me to switch careers , but im great where i .	You worry about me .	because
0	536	I went closer to him .	Grabbed one from his hand .	and
0	66915	The wide double doors to the kings table were already open .	Fine lords and ladies were milling about inside the large dining hall .	and
0	69249	He fought it held it .	It pulled at the man , but .	and
2	32512	He stared helplessly at the carnage that was being wreaked .	There was nothing he could do to stop it .	but
2	85209	Heaven knows i 've tried to talk some sense into you .	You refuse to listen .	but
2	146667	He continued to study me .	I kept my face impassive and tried to keep my fear hidden from him .	but
4	151135	He looked up , and froze like a deer in the violet light of her eyes .	She paused in the door .	when
2	57485	She tried to struggle against riordan , somewhat hurt that he had sided with a stranger .	She was weak and it was easy to force compliance .	but
1	31794	I 'm a dork .	I wear old clothes and have glasses .	because
2	41186	He tried to wrap his feelings into words and phrases to touch her heart .	His efforts were not very productive .	but
4	58568	He 'd also been too late to save elena .	She had driven off the bridge and drowned .	when
4	38813	There was a light on in the living room .	Annie pulled up to her dad 's house .	when
4	86309	She 'd already suffered one setback .	He looked at her with that peculiarly flattering expression in his bold blue eyes .	when
3	54688	Was all for it .	That was what my angel wanted to do then i .	if
0	13207	She 'd lost her mother in the worst , most horrific way .	He knew she craved stability .	and
3	31675	Reading a lot is pointless .	You dont have a brilliant mind .	if
2	1289	They were huge lenses on the face of a small , attractive .	Determined looking woman with red hair .	but
4	128284	There was light in the sky .	Ethan climbed into bed .	when
2	54493	His mother to help .	Thought better of it .	but
0	22226	Coutier approached his with a smile face , have you seen this man .	Held the drawing in front of the clerks .	and
2	55502	I suddenly realised that i might actually be in grave danger and had been a little foolish to intervene in whatever was going on .	I was resolute that this badly behaved mob stop their incessant beating of this defenceless child .	but
0	25562	On the far side from the entrance was a cellar door .	It stood a small altar - unusually romish for someone as devoted to the kirk as mrs. dalrymple .	and
4	63479	They moved to the second with juror number eleven , one sherry benton , the first black to be called .	The first row was filled .	when
4	115781	She lets you know how good it feels by telling you , grabbing your head , squeezing her legs .	You 're going down on her .	when
2	18768	No veins or major arteries appeared to have been torn .	A sizable amount of blood was dribbling onto the floor .	but
0	94899	They carefully climbed down behind the mini-sub , stopped , frozen in their tracks .	Then tiptoed around the vessel .	and
0	12410	He thinks i 'm a half-cocked gun out here . '' .	He 's dropped the dime on me .	and
4	54949	The fuel readings would start dropping like a stone .	He kicked in the afterburners to push them into the hypersonic regime .	when
2	24913	She wrote her dad a letter , telling him she loved him .	Needed to get away for a little while and she 'd call him when she could .	but
3	49485	`` ... '' `` no , you 're not bluffing .	You think i 'm bluffin .	if
0	129210	But as i was in the process of leaving , i got distracted by the rumored tomb of marie laveau .	That was where i found the little brownie .	and
0	37602	Her legs and arms are now frozen solid .	She cant move , damn , how did you manage to do this .	and
4	67560	I had always run .	The subject had been broached by anyone from my mother to reporters to a stranger who had read about the trial .	when
2	112347	Well , thank you .	You shouldnt believe everything you read nowadays , especially if it was from oak county .	but
0	112175	He took one of the shells from his cartridge belt .	Folded it over the coin in his hand .	and
0	92742	When sylah impulsively dropped to her knees beside him .	Threw her arm around his neck .	and
0	58132	To turn to eric .	Tell him that debbie had made a serious attempt on my life , just to see what would happen .	and
0	25746	When he got his only good look at mort .	Was in a strange place and scared almost witless when he got his only good look at walter , i think his mistake was both understandable and forgivable .	and
2	145379	She had no idea what was on the agenda .	Since hammer and liam had `` requested '' she wear this sheer black baby-doll , raine had her suspicions .	but
0	147480	It dropped inside , gripping it in both hands .	I quickly zipped up the bag .	and
1	148670	You have a longer rest this time .	It takes more fiddling to get the cavalry through the foot ranks .	because
1	155318	It 's all gnawing at him , eating into him . '' .	He knows he 's got to be better than he ever was .	because
2	159035	Lea tried to look calm .	She was nervous on the inside .	but
1	156883	Of which we venture through sans umbrella .	Those , as is understood by the locals , are for tourists .	because
3	30172	Has for the past two thousand years .	You agree to pluck the souls i deem .	if
2	102912	I cant explain it .	I need to know .	but
0	75916	He ... he held a knife to my throat .	Then ... '' nikki 's voice broke and she sat back on the tile floor .	and
4	79578	But , he exploded .	I confronted him with it .	when
4	16202	She had narrowed the choice down to three , one of which was a career-ending two-word sentence .	She heard movement behind reception and went to check out .	when
0	7662	These starving humans had little flesh left on their bones .	Did not satisfy like fresh-caught prey .	and
2	75206	He was tall for his age .	He hunched , making himself seem both shorter and younger .	but
3	15855	Then we can do that .	You want to move .	if
0	96071	I climbed onto his back .	He lifted his hooves , as if sensing my urgency .	and
0	75939	He soon had the mastery .	Wounding saeros ' sword-arm he had him at his mercy .	and
0	136184	Then we 'll draft a formal pardon for your crime .	Have you reinstated to your position .	and
1	113780	Baldwin realizes he must have given an involuntary start at hearing the spontaneous recognition of what he hoped was becoming their relationship .	The next thing he notices is that she winks at him and smiles fleetingly before turning back to continue speaking .	because
2	68286	Maybe it was her imagination .	There seemed to be a weird tension in the air .	but
0	67115	He was coming for the others .	He would be in a particularly ugly mood .	and
2	101368	Hart leafed quickly through the letters .	None contained the photographs .	but
3	160040	It was clear she adored them and he liked that .	Even their family dynamic was strange .	if
0	39664	My spells are not so easily thwarted .	My words shall come to pass .	and
2	137243	Ethan 's directive annoyed me .	At the same time , was so very typical of him .	but
2	112974	It had been quite a while for her .	Carter murmured for her to relax and take him in .	but
2	18874	If it had been anyone else she would have said he was waiting for lightning to strike her or waiting for the hand of god to smite her down .	Robert appeared to be interested rather than damnatory .	but
0	160748	When all the broken dishes became airborne .	Thudded into bones 's body like glass knives .	and
2	104122	When you look back , you might be amazed .	Going through it well it usually feels like a downright inconvenience and you wonder how you managed to be in such an ill-conceived situation in the first place .	but
0	131716	After a minute , when he did not respond , she wrinkled her nose .	Spoke in her quietest voice .	and
0	3463	All was well , terrified .	Then the childs overbearing mother came to snatch irena .	and
2	131371	* chapter 5 the wanderlust was old with paint flaking from its wooden hull .	It was waterproof and moved surprisingly fast with the new outboard motor .	but
2	39790	As the flaming beasts reached touching distance , akhenaten could feel the flames licking his skin .	It did not burn .	but
2	99167	Cathy 's lips pressed into a thin line , and a frown grooved between her brows .	She reached into the desk drawer and came out with a tiny little glass perfume bottle , one of those little sample sizes .	but
0	45908	He was just a second faster knocked me down again , snapping at my eyes .	With a scrabble of claws , i was up , but .	and
2	107054	Rhett did not come home nearly as often and his attention was focused on bonnie .	When he was , he was with them in the nursery .	but
0	160083	He ordered the soldiers to kill as many tulittalians as possible .	Also to burn their houses .	and
1	47779	It wasnt for official games ; they just practiced .	There wasnt any real place to sit .	because
3	29121	It 'd be bobbing to the surface the whole time . '' .	It was shaped like a ball .	if
0	70612	When she came to my bed .	... '' he swallowed .	and
2	31084	Best to pick one that might be harder to hit .	Would cause less flaying and pain .	but
0	125354	Slowly closing the gap breaking out her colors .	Following like a shadow and .	and
0	92491	How dare you walk into my kitchen .	Tell me you might love me .	and
0	108213	How easily it would have been for my position chase 's to be reversed .	The way it pumped through my veins , and .	and
4	17870	I want you to have me .	I 'm full , when i can give something back to you .	when
1	79047	You have no idea what 's going on outside your little world .	You have no access to it .	because
2	104339	The backpack was light .	It contained everything she needed .	but
0	30988	Here he was sitting at a table next to her , wearing a mardis-gras shirt saying provocative things to her .	After that , he would have moved on to his next conquest , but .	and
0	143636	He knows a great deal about diseases .	He swears up and down that no disease can kill a man in just a half day .	and
2	88623	She tried to write .	Nothing comprehensible came out .	but
0	39793	There is a stage .	There is another stage .	and
2	7919	I wanted to smile .	Dr. qadirahs words felt heavy in my heart .	but
2	111688	The two of them were not only brothers .	Partners in crime , best friends and they loved each other .	but
0	122132	They returned , and again korkungal brushed them away like flies .	Set to pricking him .	and
0	32775	Yes , the claim is a hit run but .	We believe its a false claim .	and
2	36987	Marius turned the keys in the ignition .	All that came from the engine was a steady , slow wuh-wuh-wuh-wuh , then silence .	but
2	70380	`` i caught the scent , and . '' .	Only i 'll know if it was the same person .	but
2	94219	`` i might drop by .	I 'm not staying .	but
0	6294	Dr. cordova is gone .	I 'm not hell-bent on finding hapa .	and
0	129084	As though the refrigerator had just closed and , before she realized what she was doing , kira grabbed the book .	Stuffed it in her bag .	and
4	90806	Mrs. phancey , an iron-gray woman with bitter , mistrustful eyes and a grim slit of a mouth , was at the desk .	I came in that evening .	when
2	86038	It is not a question of safety , your grace . '' .	How we can best serve you , and , through you , mortain .	but
0	93808	His fingers stroked my bare arms .	Grasped my hands in his .	and
4	12548	Her parents had divorced .	She was young and from that time forward , cecilia and her mother had lived in apartments .	when
2	114789	Were still a couple years ahead of when you left .	The last bit should be comfortable enough to do by chronometer .	but
0	109752	Sam 's stare still locked on her .	She realized that , yes , he knew about more fallen .	and
4	120625	He started to get a bad feeling .	He glimpsed the thoughtful light in those big blue eyes .	when
3	113987	Will she freak out .	I hold her hand or try to get close .	if
0	13334	I told them there were 613 .	They were laws or rules in general concerned with attitude , what one does , good behavior , and what one says .	and
3	81185	I 'd have raised hell ages .	I was in his place .	if
2	15142	She starts to answer , grinning , her jaw already pushed out in pride .	She looks at his hands , formed into tight fists at his hips , and her expression straightens .	but
3	75623	Can never be absolute .	Our theories are indeed true for the certainty on which these theories are based .	if
2	47619	The latest was that love reckoned a connection with the hospital was the main factor .	He had nothing to go on .	but
2	104975	I loved gravity and guardians of the galaxy .	I think i can avoid stealing anything from them .	but
4	74270	And my cheeks stung with shame for him .	I saw him bound down at the knees and at the neck , hands laced as the crowd scolded him .	when
2	139474	He had no choice .	To let me go .	but
0	90876	I smiled at him .	He turned to trent , fear in his eyes .	and
0	31823	The memory of my mother was a faint one .	It hurt to flash back to that time .	and
4	18712	She felt that the extra hour of rest had counted for more than the previous seven combined .	She awoke , breathing deeply and .	when
2	133263	She was able to breathe properly now , and the taste of stan 's blood in her mouth made her want to puke .	Was seeing stars from lack of oxygen .	but
4	72238	That would just screw me .	They got what they wanted .	when
0	156246	He moved to the entrance once in the foyer slammed it shut behind him .	Shoved the massive door .	and
2	70481	It probably seems i couldnt possibly drink more .	One should never underestimate me at anything .	but
1	134021	Your book will turn to stone .	Your book was the one that killed radfewx and thus will result in a major change for all others .	because
2	39053	Why she was protecting her uncle was beyond joshuas scope of understanding .	He would not demand an answer .	but
0	122488	Your father has been fetching them .	Signing for them all day .	and
1	157609	Nothin ' came of it but somethin ' special grew out of that for jules and luke .	Mainly jules had already given her heart to vance .	because
2	132330	She wanted to be better for them all .	Her heart was stuttering , and throughout her body a strange lethargy was spreading .	but
4	49758	Theresa nonetheless began to cry .	Linda later walked to the microphone to perform a dreamy ballad .	when
0	135627	So accomplished after negotiating to meet with the duke .	Especially returning to stony vale and helping set matters .	and
4	149138	Once i had overheard sister appollonia and sister magdelena discussing it .	I was five years old and locked in the wine cellar as punishment .	when
2	60571	* * * `` honored one , i know a call from me is likely unwelcome at this time .	I 've had two hits on lissa 's information .	but
1	22660	Amanda was in school , too , working on her nursing degree , which was great for grant and isabelle .	They got to see rachel more often than .	because
4	137283	Black winny was blamed .	A branch creaked or the wind whistled .	when
4	54142	Saw a darkness in her eyes .	She said the words , and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water .	when
2	102191	It looks like an oversized watch .	It receives print messages .	but
3	71701	And that question the day before we were supposed to get married , i 'd probably have said we still did .	You 'd asked me .	if
2	64701	The question was inadequate .	It would have been too stupid to ask edward if he cared .	but
2	144612	Kenzie and i tensed .	Neither of them were looking at us .	but
0	51739	`` we 'll be seen , '' i said .	Nodded toward the news crews .	and
1	154719	A gallon or two of $ 5.00 gas per day to run one of their engines was still a decent savings on electricity for a medium to large house .	Electricity costs had also skyrocketed .	because
2	100573	He 's the leading specialist in elbow injuries , usually with football quarterbacks .	He knows what he 's talking .	but
2	123095	The paramedic continued , im sorry , maam .	We got ta go .	but
4	107811	They were in trouble .	They were called by their middle name .	when
0	124858	The pair walked toward the stables .	Once out of view of the men , emilio got down on one knee so as better to get his point across .	and
2	26299	There was still the occasional tantrum .	To his relief they were few and far between .	but
2	135455	He kind of liked him after all .	Really wanted to see him devoured by something acidic .	but
4	10328	She 'd taken two steps in that direction .	She heard a soft noise behind her .	when
4	109033	He grinned and drew something .	He saw the look of disappointment on his guests face .	when
0	88451	He opened his mouth sucked it .	Put her finger to his lips .	and
0	111589	Many of the fairways were narrow .	Lined with huge douglas firs .	and
0	33937	Fyngaard was a two week 's ride away from karsvall .	I was d-o-n-e done with sleigh rides .	and
3	79913	She might have just died .	He hadnt happened to be .	if
3	56275	I would go to a place called medalia .	I ever did run .	if
2	54207	He could do nothing about the latter things .	He could purchase a home .	but
0	92560	She wrapped her arms around ginnys shuddering frame .	Squeezed her as tightly as she could .	and
2	36131	She could still afford the material .	After a wistful look at the two books she 'd selected , she cleared her throat .	but
4	90776	He just smiles and says , i know , mom .	She gives him grief for it .	when
2	32463	To answer nothing came out .	Make a joke or something .	but
0	82517	She saw my meal on the table .	Stood by the doorway .	and
2	152190	It was so awfully terminal .	There was nothing that could be done .	but
2	151889	Notice the dna changes in your appearance .	A swab will come back with someone other than you .	but
0	98610	Theyd gotten in a fight .	He doesnt want to call her .	and
2	130932	He noted several patches of inkroot poking through the covering clover .	The weeds would have to wait .	but
3	84922	To push her as far away from him as possible .	Even he had to make her hate him .	if
0	29017	It released michelle 's leg .	Doubled up , snapping at his hand .	and
0	156966	There were no faeries that he knew of left in the land of calundra .	There were more faeries left in the wood other than this child he did not know , but he doubted the child would have ventured from its safety if there had been even one .	and
0	42714	To get up at any minute .	Walk back to the church .	and
2	60798	He found it soothing .	There was always the fear of the bad dream .	but
3	9519	Where would she be .	Even she 'd managed to get .	if
0	64807	He roared , sticking his spear through the neck of a morr , right into his head .	Jumped right back into action .	and
4	91008	It was his custom .	Unpleasant things had to be said , to sweeten his breath .	when
0	125608	I 'd learned the darkling 's plans .	Fled in the back of a wagon .	and
2	38760	He rested a hand on my shoulder .	I was too worried to care about the touch .	but
3	29285	You should have started about six weeks ago . '' .	You wanted to act like a guardian .	if
0	146546	Rising to his feet .	Jumping down from the platform .	and
0	121744	The vampires are in charge .	Realize that something of this nature may not be accomplished by merely killing the council .	and
3	26331	I suspect that this forest will soon surrender a fair portion of its native occupants .	I dont become more proficient at farming .	if
4	33501	Claire had noticed them just a couple of hours earlier .	She and renata and dylan had paused at a greasy-spoon diner for lunch in a neighboring town .	when
4	99444	They were just entering the pine trees .	Kaelah felt an odd tremor in the ground under her feet .	when
2	61375	They would have been of great use a few minutes .	There had been no time to fetch them .	but
3	140678	There would be no problem .	They chose , from now on , to ignore the rules for the sake of increased production .	if
2	64919	Her eyes are still leaking .	She 's not trembling any longer .	but
1	23289	They wanted word to spread .	The guy had a kill zone stretching across four states .	because
2	21465	No doubt , '' he said , running his hand down his beard , `` .	Does my lord forget that there are other , nearer , dangers .	but
1	124530	To be very , very wrinkly .	If you want slow , by god , you 're getting slow .	because
3	69162	They were to high tail it back to the second town .	They found no trace .	if
0	34129	The sputter of the cars engine broke maya out of her trance .	She bolted for her vehicle , black robe billowing around her as she ran .	and
0	24479	The night was quiet peaceful around me , and .	The only sounds came from the insects , singing their endless song .	and
3	45231	What else were we wrong about .	The world wasnt cleanly divided into black and white .	if
3	142393	She was going to pull all the way into the station with a roar .	He had anything to say about it .	if
4	59282	Only a chinook can rescue .	Heavy equipment is at stake .	when
2	111936	The problem was she was in love with him and .	Telling him that would only hurt him more .	but
0	115467	Mike released the man 's hand .	Crossed the few steps that divided him from the woman 's pain .	and
0	130282	The pavilion had been completely cleared by evening on tuesday , the wooden wind barrier , the tents .	The rented furniture all hauled .	and
2	16864	Wymack 's expression was still too blank for neil to feel safe .	He knew better than to look .	but
0	10821	I ushered her inside and took her hands in mine .	Brought her over to the couch .	and
2	114614	He had anxiety about being around several mages at once -- an environment which was far too similar to his imprisonment at the high tower .	Even more terrifying than that was the girl emily and the way she looked up at him with those wide brown eyes .	but
0	89963	Hesitantly , gus held onto matts shoulders .	Jumped on his back .	and
1	100107	I 'm nice . '' .	I 'm genuinely fond of you .	because
0	128200	Alice grunted with displeasure .	Squeezed her eyes shut for several seconds .	and
3	31302	Then we must join it .	There is to be a war against the ingles branco .	if
2	133564	We wanted to know if you needed help . '' .	It looks like you 've got everything under control .	but
2	44306	He still wore the dress shirt and hed added a waistcoat in a brilliant red tapestry pattern and a jet black jacket so rich and plush it looked like leopard furand probably was .	Faded levis that were such a popular trend with businessmen these days .	but
2	38266	Cress tried to offer him her elbow .	Thorne only gave it a gentle squeeze before letting go .	but
2	148276	She could have awakened .	She had n't . .	but
3	137942	My uncle and i can give ye information regarding her guns and crew-and , i doubt but he 'll have a job to fight her .	Even stebbings has taken the ship .	if
0	134342	Those days were over .	The counselling had at least taught him how to deal with these situations .	and
0	30127	It was the only one i had . '' .	He was the only father i ever knew .	and
2	70625	It took a while .	He came back because he loved me .	but
1	27208	Her choking back a scream .	The pleasure had just ripped right through her .	because
2	6176	Scott threaded the other shoe .	Left the laces untied and dangling .	but
1	55509	But you have to challenge me for drum captain , '' i burst out .	At least i tried .	because
0	30694	Sazed rose , opening the shutters , letting in the light .	Walked to the window .	and
4	17975	Stinky noticed immediately how lovely she felt .	The colors flashed on her skin .	when
1	64534	I could not stop the twitching of my feet , and there i stood , perplexed and all alone amid the wood .	The elfin magic was too strong and then the elf was gone .	because
4	6670	Confirmation of his height came .	He walked past angels gunwale .	when
0	116315	A policeman helped break down the front door .	Mrs weedon was taken away in an ambulance to south west general .	and
0	50079	My heart started to pound .	I knew he could hear it .	and
0	56271	He 's been in the park .	Would have marked his territory all the time .	and
2	11154	A couple of male operatives were skeletally thin .	Only one had brick red skin .	but
2	100046	She reached for the cup .	I jerked it away from her grasp .	but
2	160300	Glancing around the market , james searched for a bakery .	Couldnt make one out .	but
4	22080	I wanted to cry .	I finally got off the phone with my contact .	when
2	157177	Normally he would borrow berger 's car .	That was no longer possible .	but
0	79055	Many doctors and hospitals were also guilty of over-prescribing .	Padding the bills of those who were insured .	and
2	94422	She leaned heavily on her walker .	She was also smiling .	but
2	135585	Most were calf ; something soft , but unpleasantly oily to the touch .	There were two or three bound in something different .	but
2	101301	Behind them , thomas had apparently gotten out of the car .	His voice sounded weak , like he was in danger of fainting .	but
2	119078	The hesitation was telling .	He caught his balance .	but
2	54892	You do have the house and everything will be fine .	So just sign this document .	but
2	61991	Her eyes were beginning to water .	She held on to a pained smile .	but
1	37406	Had resorted to stripping .	It was the only way she could earn a living .	because
1	41963	This established fact gave poncey hope .	He was tenacious if nothing else , and he talked zeke into letting him drive the pickup in the race .	because
0	13303	Who you piss off , step on , or hurt .	You 'll walk right into some trap that he sets for you .	and
3	152722	It was being too easily coerced .	Paul had a weakness .	if
4	116287	He didnt move , and she had the horrifying thought that he was dead .	She touched his face .	when
4	54572	She 'd thrown out .	She 'd talked to the human girl .	when
3	68929	You would have heard me say that i 'm not even interested in a convenience contract .	You had been listening .	if
1	5536	Their deaths were just as neat , clean kills .	All of them were exact .	because
0	3004	One day he would be a great master .	People from all over the world would pay to hear his gift .	and
2	9380	Who not only has problems with sociability .	Also living with himself .	but
4	91418	Promised to introduce hanna to her bazaar-editor aunt .	She visited for christmas .	when
0	153343	She hurried after douglas .	Saw he was headed to the study .	and
4	119133	He was a head shorter than lev .	They last saw each other .	when
2	129380	Next to them was a tankard of po , it would not be needed during their sleep .	It was a tribal tradition , done by all warriors .	but
2	142837	I will not apologize for what i said .	I certainly did not mean to scare you .	but
0	113213	Streaks of flames blazed through his cock , teased his thighs .	Raced down his legs to his toes .	and
0	13299	You mention her again like that .	We are going to have a serious problem .	and
2	82671	Richard said he contemplated writing a book about his crazy ex-employer .	He was afraid dirk would send one of his gorilla bodyguards after him .	but
3	108310	Have it wired to my phone or ipad .	I had one , within seconds .	if
0	4625	That had been got into some kind of order .	They , at least had the appearance of being ready to attend a coronation .	and
4	44049	Quickly abandoned her plan .	Ryan asked her to dance .	when
2	40372	Jawen knew they had a bit of a history .	She thought that this time she would get along better with him , that she could overlook those problems .	but
0	64309	Mouth bleeding freely , he landed in a cloud of debris , tumbled into the rubble like a ragdoll did not move .	Bounced with a sickening crack .	and
0	43741	The grotesque idol shattered beneath the blow .	Its shards flew out in all directions .	and
0	47007	The stands were in an uproar .	As i stood , the noise hit me in the chest like a wall of sound .	and
2	60091	The figure shouted at her .	She heard only her own voice .	but
4	67580	It rammed his shoulder so hard he fell to one knee .	He tried to push it .	when
2	65756	We could never prove it .	We think ol tommy and his gang assaulted her last summer on the beachas in .	but
4	41887	My father said into the awkward silence , i hated my father for not being there for me and my mother .	I was a young boy .	when
0	54473	Her hair was all messed up .	He liked the fact that his hands had been the cause .	and
2	139789	Apparently , he 'd meant later . '' .	He nodded and headed around the garage saying , `` i 'll only be a minute .	but
2	8916	He tried to release his fingers from around thorns throat so he could fight the ankles around his own .	Thorn wouldnt let him .	but
3	18969	Now he had a chance .	Her father had not poisoned her against him .	if
3	63346	I 'll go to a bierkeller .	I see the samepair of headlights .	if
0	158568	That smelled like heather .	Covered the crow 's bare legs to midthigh .	and
0	152709	But he had no leverage .	The straps held him .	and
2	8546	To bring kendra to the chapel .	To bring kendra to muriel .	but
2	28271	Nathan , i ... '' she stopped .	Then decided to say it .	but
0	133315	Oh , ty , '' she 'd said .	He 'd slunk away , looking horrified .	and
3	56101	`` , i 'd be eternally grateful .	You can see to montague .	if
0	114540	A second the real ones did and kat fired at the one in the lead .	Hit its weak spot .	and
0	68092	There really was no room for embarrassment .	Amber refused to allow the way she was raised to cloud her judgment .	and
0	61348	Soon they were past the last houses shops , and .	Crossing the large grassy area that surrounded the city to the south .	and
2	116256	The general attitude you want to have is that this is an unwelcome delay to your otherwise sober night .	You want to layer that under the false veil of understanding and an acknowledgement that the police are keeping the streets safe for sober people like you .	but
0	42655	Dad picked me up in his arms .	Carried me out of the jungle .	and
2	75718	She sent many of them scurrying back into the darkness of the night .	There were yet some that would not relent until they had troubled the young man 's thoughts .	but
0	28228	We heard about a sent one who wreaked havoc in a phoenix camp weeks .	We were in the area , looking for you .	and
2	67708	At seventeen it had been .	What i did in the dark to myself was entirely different than what he did , and i found with guilt that i preferred flying solo .	but
3	138511	Then by damn , they could answer della 's .	Those death angels could answer kylie 's questions .	if
2	102013	The maax belonging to this particular moment in time was currently trapped inside a cenote .	He would not be freed for another nineteen years or .	but
0	105906	He held out his hand opened his fist , her red earrings and leather strapped pendant in his palm .	Turned it palm up .	and
0	81145	The computer desks had gone .	At the end of the room was an ornate wooden stand with an opened book resting on it .	and
4	140933	She had not seen him since before harry had died , he too had dropped harry .	He became a social embarrassment .	when
4	27258	The first act of teleportation had occurred by accident .	He spilled some acid on his papers and himself .	when
0	18619	Some thought this morning .	I 've come up with a couple of ideas that might work .	and
4	42622	Hethe had just reached the bottom step .	The door to the kitchens opened and lady helen came out .	when
0	74858	Yep , a demon was second-in-command of the demon slayers .	None of them knew it .	and
2	104332	I know henric uses it when he travels .	I dont know if we own it .	but
2	50077	Chase has been trying to come visit us for some time .	I have been putting him off .	but
4	89144	Back in iraq you didnt look this bad .	You got hit by that grenade .	when
0	106559	Susannah lay down looked up at the stars wheeling slowly across the black sky .	Laced her hands behind her head .	and
3	72817	To be something more than the weird girl .	Even you two are the only ones who know it .	if
4	124056	Feeling as relaxed as a cat in a pool of sunshine , jason was in the backyard on the chaise i 'd used the day .	I got up the next day at noon .	when
1	142272	I 'm always the go-to person to bail someone out of trouble .	Mostly i am calm and unflustered .	because
2	146409	His father had died in a garage , just like johnny 's brother .	Ralph dawes had not committed suicide .	but
4	26743	What i propose twenty four .	The doorbell rang about fifteen minutes later it was angela who went to answer it .	when
2	132552	I think they appreciated the effort , whether they knew what i was doing or .	They were not nearly as critical as i had expected .	but
2	70341	It was much more of an obstacle than the simple door locks he 'd successfully picked before .	He 'd lose nothing by trying .	but
2	16618	You need to prepare the plan .	Time is critical , as you mentioned over the next two to three hours most forces are in open areas soon they will hit more urban areas .	but
4	27660	To avert her gaze .	He took off his t-shirt to replace it with a more cuddle-compatible hoodie .	when
2	45844	I wanted to be sophisticated and interesting .	I was pretty sure i was nervous and obviously attracted to him .	but
1	87400	They had learned to trust each other .	There had been no one else to trust .	because
0	130666	Where you will never find it .	When the three days are concluded , when the army has entered through all gates , and when the hebrews are on the march , i will see that you have its contents .	and
2	34977	I can go with you to see marcus tang . '' .	I 'll be leaving shortly after that .	but
4	13541	She really was hurt .	The meteor shower came .	when
2	8934	There were details to be worked out .	They had essentially completed the task of transition to the new balance as they saw it .	but
2	16004	The appearance was corpselike .	The face was alive , a living cadaver sucking everything in sightand daniel was heading right into its open maw .	but
3	137407	Was he just asking me .	Jett was telling the truth .	if
3	127331	We will see them at this distance .	It gets dark theres no way .	if
4	96472	On the fourth or fifth day of them torturing us , she had thrown up .	They had pulled the needle out of her spine .	when
0	26126	Then they were on the other side , and .	Mya stone was laughing and lifting robert for a hug .	and
0	123173	To slip into the familiar theater , at school .	Clamored on the stage where i knew my place .	and
2	137703	The envoy accepted the scroll and knew not what to say .	Nodded his head in appreciation .	but
0	18084	Their partnership was less than a day old .	He had already received a dressing-down .	and
2	156787	She grabbed for the top two there were too many to catch .	The pile of books in her arms began to slide and .	but
0	55741	He wants to level charges .	Then torture a confession out of me .	and
3	66642	I would say he was looking at me .	I had to put a name to it .	if
2	34985	Well , obviously it was a knife .	Kira handled the thing like it was a special kind of knife .	but
2	94495	We might have to wait two more days .	It will be safer .	but
3	9345	I would choose terror , a quick and final end .	I had a choice between the two .	if
3	49741	Then perhaps it is possible to do more .	I can reach the cursed city .	if
4	143794	His heart had damn near stopped .	He 'd gone back to the clearing near the cabin and she 'd been gone .	when
3	77733	`` , yeah . '' .	There are only two choices .	if
3	106935	E asks his lordship .	Thats all theyre looking for .	if
0	128371	I looked at myself in the mirror .	Noticed that some of the swelling had already gone down under my eyes .	and
0	101131	Raising the gun drawing back the hammer .	Levelling the sights on my head .	and
2	132123	She thought she had saved you .	Really she killed you .	but
4	148239	Jacob had been very grateful .	Charlie bought billy 's truck for me , saving jacob from having to drive it when he came of age .	when
4	52468	He was alone and looked just as unhappy as he 'd been when he left .	She finally saw him coming back around the corner .	when
0	82049	Go ahead on back to the gate .	Tell him that we will come out to meet him .	and
0	111400	I took such delight in you .	We all did , and old berekhiah and sherebiah from nazareth , how they loved you and wanted you to stay .	and
4	83326	He had several other tattoos along one of his muscular tights .	Did you get those scars .	when
2	64493	The other humans remained standing .	Were holding their hands as if they were also in pain to some extent .	but
0	35035	By luck , at that moment , a trick card fell out of a man 's sleeve , a prostitute slapped a pirate wench .	The tavern exploded into a brawl .	and
3	53465	He remembered thinking how he would court her and win her from his father .	She would have him .	if
2	44558	It was crazy high school love .	It was real and it was true .	but
2	26047	He continues , `` .	I want one of those cupcakes .	but
3	42966	And i had no intention of leaving tess like this .	They achieved what they wanted .	if
2	82854	I get the urgency .	Suicide is suicide and while ill help you , none of this makes it easy .	but
0	38375	This time , you 'll need to embark on an adventure discover it .	I am aware of that but . '' .	and
0	50848	As the sun rose , it gave the fog surrounding them a kind of mystical glow .	The droplets hanging along the edges of individual leaves drooping from the undergrowth at the side of the road took on a jewel like sparkle .	and
2	69968	[ i will do my best to explain .	I am only a pilot .	but
2	125404	Maybe not she was unhappy .	There was somewhere cooler she wanted to be .	but
0	90272	Before he did , he leaned down whispered something in the younger boy 's ear .	Shay took a single step away from lucas , but .	and
4	97346	He stopped and gave him a glare .	Sam drew even with ace .	when
0	48082	It looks to be small bones and a tangle of feathers .	Tosses it on the brazier .	and
4	52287	Burke 's arms had been wrapped around her .	She 'd awakened this morning .	when
0	16909	The woman , now suddenly and completely dry , looked beautiful .	Wore regular but modest clothing .	and
2	24383	I could tell he wanted to speed .	Drove painfully slow so that i could follow him .	but
3	28647	Miranda would get upset .	I did n't . .	if
2	34761	Thirteen the man was about ezio 's age .	Running to fat and not in the greatest shape .	but
1	52616	So i did what they asked .	They gave me a home .	because
0	107466	Seth put the ball back in play .	The sphinx swiftly scored .	and
0	45847	* * * it was never easy to keep up with jace .	Now , when he was running nearly flat out , it was almost impossible .	and
4	5016	I figured id give it to your mother .	You werent going to be .	when
2	153462	I could see her itching to do something intricate to my hair .	I shook my head .	but
2	62187	She wanted me to finish school here , with my friends .	I know being so far away ate at her .	but
2	6860	It was after midnight .	His son seemed wide-awake as they drove home from skye 's .	but
2	156834	Instinctively , i reached out to steady myself .	The soldier i touched shrank back from me as if burned .	but
0	146283	He hesitantly crossed the stage to the center .	Once he reached the exact middle , the shades on the stage began to swirl .	and
2	50738	She tended to angelina as if she were a newborn .	She did need allens help changing her clothes .	but
3	154330	To slap us around .	One of us tried to do something stupid .	if
0	101804	It was a bad decision . '' .	Now i 'm paying the price .	and
0	117502	Eventually they learned about this new coven .	Came to southern california .	and
0	17412	Old bruria came with us .	So did joseph though it seemed harder than ever for him to make the journey up the hill .	and
3	126574	Then it would consume them for a total of four days .	They kept their pace .	if
3	15720	He probably did not have long before he ran out of anything to breathe .	The place was indeed airtight .	if
0	98251	People , men , had hurt her .	Left her with tears and broken skin .	and
2	97812	Chase stone is an old pal .	He 's also a professional acquaintance .	but
0	54962	Her eyes opened just a slit .	When he saw them .	and
0	124849	He offered to take charge of the matter , as it please the king , detailing the cost of every improvement .	Went from that to speak of how he had strengthened the port 's defenses .	and
2	58425	`` you probably know this . '' .	Fooling around with vampires certainly makes you thirsty .	but
2	91515	With a shrug , `` .	If you continue to stonewall us it 's an option we 'll be forced to investigate .	but
4	112182	Recalling the even louder scream .	They discovered it was false .	when
0	65221	Smoke flowing from his large nostrils .	The rumbling of the furnace within his bosom .	and
1	78646	That pothinus took , that he realized who i was .	Each step was bringing him closer to the moment .	because
2	8455	The others had left that image .	Boundless continued to remember .	but
1	141232	I came to you .	I thought youd listen .	because
0	35662	Then they swept the neighboring areas .	Found a few thousand injured mongols hiding in small groups .	and
4	67334	Then , she was asked into holy matrimony by a widower with three children and she did care for them , somewhat more gently than she had cared for john .	It looked like she was in for a long life all .	when
0	21000	Life had dealt him the worst possible hand .	Still he 'd survived without losing his decency .	and
2	22619	Now , it is silent to me , and .	It speaks to you .	but
3	63507	They can harness your powers and use them for their own gain . '' .	They can capture you while you 're weak .	if
0	123003	Ravenwood was just we had left it , down to the cake left out on plates , to the tea set .	The stack of unopened birthday presents .	and
4	134620	To be standing in line at a little bookstore downtown .	The guy in front of me was buying one of his books .	when
4	114127	Her had begun dancing the samba .	Hunter had said he loved her .	when
2	142533	It would have been faster for her to go out the front entrance .	That would have meant going through the common room in the lobby .	but
2	62466	She got done and the third time she told him she had to get on back to work so he walked out .	He told her to do it again cause he missed some stuff .	but
4	19104	It worked to his advantage .	It came to handling the neighborhood teens at the sports outreach .	when
3	35798	'' that would take time .	Even he wanted to `` change .	if
2	111007	Diallo placed a hand on his shoulder , and .	He felt a sudden familiar soothing flow of warmth .	but
2	5724	It was only two hours .	It was the stuff that made us who we were .	but
0	49327	She was at a friend 's house your dad was still at the office .	Called cheryl , but .	and
2	11082	We sneaked in a few kisses , touches , and flirting .	That was bound to happen .	but
0	13717	Ken shouldered his pack .	Stalked across the tarmac to the waiting plane .	and
2	152775	I have to do this . '' .	I 'll come back as soon as i can .	but
2	159874	Gold is pretty , i guess .	When you get right down to it , it has little actual value .	but
2	72008	The screen continued to speak .	I had stopped listening .	but
2	113150	It was breaking the chain of command .	Jake was a much more reasonable man than his father .	but
0	12857	When all the flickers of light in the cave started swirling .	Then shifted as if to dance on top of the water .	and
2	105277	The table was situated where they could look out .	No one would see them .	but
0	50296	Karl framm pushed back his slouchy hat until it sat on the back of his head .	Gave a long sigh , like a man who was inordinately put upon .	and
2	65356	I have told you this .	You refuse to obey .	but
3	49745	The imperial guards will protect you .	Anything is done in haste .	if
4	67456	The only time i expect you to obey me without hesitation is .	Your life is on the line and we 're in a combat situation .	when
4	76584	He stared at me .	I walked past him .	when
0	43985	England had once been the master of all the oceans commanding the largest and most disciplined navy in the world , there was no energy to power them and they were all sitting rusting in the thames estuary .	Even several battleships had survived the minimum .	and
4	27088	Those thoughts quickly faded .	Gavin pulled down the scalloped edge of her white lace bra .	when
0	135212	He still had his cup in his hand .	It seemed as if the weight of it had kept him from coming .	and
3	58835	Take leadership , and do whats right , you must do it .	No one else is going to stand up .	if
4	122186	The light of the afternoon sun stabbed at my eyes in a cheerfully vicious fashion , and i was glad , disarmed my magical wards , unlocked the door , and shoved hard at it .	I shambled down the steps to my basement apartment .	when
2	116235	The sheriff cut the ropes holding the net .	Made the two men stumble up out of the river still caught in their net .	but
3	37867	Id only get a piece of it .	Even blythe ever gave me her heart .	if
2	82794	She offered to run me back to the boat .	I told her the walk would be good for me .	but
0	138652	Peter was baby talking .	Buster was eating it up .	and
2	74910	So yes , that man will probably kill anyone who ever tries to harm you .	Your strength is internal .	but
3	33765	How it would come to pass .	The telling were disagreeable to me .	if
0	37567	When he 'd ripped her world .	Told her the truth about herself .	and
0	107095	Richard stalked across the floor .	Came to stand by her side .	and
0	107634	The french have been looking for any excuse to invade our kingdom . '' .	Have crossed our borders to pursue that goal .	and
2	119693	Oh , the bridge of the nose and the set of the eyes were similar .	Cheo shook his head .	but
2	112559	Having no effect on him .	Managing to flare her arousal .	but
0	56046	When the purple hue of evening began to creep up the eastern sky , errand fed the horse went back into the citadel in search of his friends .	Promised that he would come again the following day .	and
4	101240	As was my usual practice , except that i had left off the rib-hugging vest , as the evening was warm .	Not modeling in the studio or off on the town , i had worn this day my lawson peabody serving-girl rig .	when
0	72317	Kendra failed to maintain her grip fell to the ground also , landing in a muddy puddle .	The massive figure toppled , but .	and
0	141192	Alec looked me over inappropriately smiling face .	Confused by my palpable anger .	and
0	27498	Lord , i need you to direct my steps .	I can not afford to make a mistake .	and
3	156286	And everyone probably wondered .	The conflict between the two highprinces would escalate .	if
2	24970	I 'm reasonably certain you 're safe in your house .	You keep leaving that safety .	but
0	126739	He said slowly released the clutch .	Put her foot on the gas .	and
4	76235	Staying here with him .	She could have run .	when
4	66211	That would leave only dovim overhead .	The invisible planet arrived this time .	when
0	55027	She had an easy manner .	Was always ready with a good joke .	and
0	92686	He put his hand to his head .	Looked at the ground , embarrassed and ashamed .	and
2	96062	It would have been nearly as funny except that he is totally embarrassed due to some of his teammates walking to class .	Then i see this dark look in his eyes .	but
1	31042	Her adoptive parents were scared to have kids .	They were afraid that della 's grandmother 's mental illness was genetic .	because
0	157437	She 'd stop being so bloody-minded .	Realise she wanted him .	and
2	44545	Any musket had been found in the craft .	Mallett had inspected the weapon caleb had brought back from the island with him and declared it serviceable .	but
4	50172	I sometimes provided blood for him , or our wounds were too many and we had to wait to heal .	Our hunt took us places where there was no sustenance for either of us .	when
4	76800	However a towering figure was standing near his head .	He opened his eyes .	when
3	84272	In any case it was already done .	There was damage to do .	if
3	144521	To make matters worse .	She shot me in the head and nothing happened it was likely to raise her suspicions .	if
2	70752	With her attempt at lightening the mood , serena expects another playful smile from him .	It does not come .	but
4	62297	`` , i did an extensive amount of traveling .	I left home after felicia died .	when
3	103502	The girls would have seemed truthful .	Spencer were a bystander to the conversation .	if
0	73508	Cant afford to be crazy , cillian said .	Nell noticed that his words were a little slurred .	and
1	71531	Something was not quite right .	They over compensated and the deck started to tilt the other way at an increasingly alarming rate .	because
0	122886	They should be empty the businesses usually are at night , for his sake he hopes .	Prays that they are .	and
0	135597	The notes are made by pressing different combinations of buttons .	Songs are made by putting together different combinations of notes .	and
3	99296	But why would she give two shits about what drew thinks or feels about her .	Kate is back with .	if
4	109884	How much time had passed .	Jed finally turned to face her .	when
2	157393	There are still havens of the high elves .	They are far north and west , beyond the land of the halflings .	but
4	38884	I saw it with the cows ; with the goats on the farm ; with the sheep near the fields .	I lived on the ranch .	when
2	50376	He had been a traitor .	With a history like his , she understood it .	but
1	92811	Slap my hand over my forehead .	It all feels too good to be true , first i have a decent guy in my life for once , and now this .	because
0	18405	He threw himself to the floor .	Rolled under the desk .	and
0	118104	I seized the opportunity to undress quickly hide my favorite kalvaka t-shirt inside the folds of my scratchy new garment .	Throw on the tunic .	and
2	43331	That can not only resolve an image .	Can actually render it in color .	but
0	91376	When i heard the clinking .	Jingling of a cart being rolled into the room .	and
0	57351	They had cooked their breakfast .	Settled on the ambush positions .	and
2	73913	After a minute fooman stopped trying and sat down , leaned back in his chair with a false defiance .	He was obviously scared , frustrated , and already going mad .	but
4	35779	It brought tom back to that night in iraq .	He and rahim had sat up high looking out on the green zone .	when
2	64645	He was king it was not to be .	How he wished , his brothers were dead and .	but
3	4304	I 'm not going to be happy .	You get us lost .	if
3	92476	`` , we 'd make out on the floor all night .	You had your way .	if
0	132160	She was liam 's destined mate .	She had begged sasha not to share the truth with nathan .	and
4	148612	She was about to turn off her computer .	She heard his tread on the stairs .	when
3	95830	You 're not going to be able to tunnel through to him .	That 's what you 're thinking .	if
0	139318	Smyth stood beside him , brows lifted , and made a rather expressive coughing noise .	Rocked from heal to toe .	and
2	47049	I knew she loved her son .	Her main concern here seemed to be less about tatiana 's final rest than it was about what others would think about a breach of protocol .	but
0	55980	Us ride hard to the east , to the nearest town .	Put the word out .	and
0	135262	That done , she collected will once more , veering once again through another doorway , this time into his room .	Began pulling him into the hall behind her .	and
1	133254	Sharing a small part of himself with her .	Maybe he was really talking to her .	because
3	104573	Going on a date .	About you met her .	if
0	20723	They flew over me , toppled , but quickly gained their bearings .	Climbed to their feet .	and
0	66148	He burst through the apartment door .	Dropped her on the bed .	and
2	108941	They got their ways of doing things and .	It 's not my place to tell them different .	but
0	144232	The man was obviously crippled .	He was not conscious .	and
2	135183	Physical exercise was still not one of her favorite things .	She had been trying to adapt to our new world .	but
3	33007	She 'd try it .	Perhaps tomorrow 's lesson were just as boring .	if
0	72376	Now he has a clean slate .	Any knowledge he learns can perhaps be used for good .	and
3	126256	`` , '' will said .	We 'd only happened along a little earlier .	if
2	26944	I was trying not to scare you .	That last part was so rushed .	but
0	124717	All eyes were on milos .	Milos looked out at them , watching them watching him .	and
4	112769	She will either run away into the forest and break your heart or kill you .	The gorilla grows up .	when
0	44868	He leaned in , the mint and old spice .	Brushed his lips against mine and i breathed in that comforting , familiar musk of his .	and
1	20205	`` i only came up here . '' .	I saw the water on the floor and was trying to-to dry it before someone could slip .	because
3	153214	Fat charlie wondered but a curtain twitched in an upper room .	Perhaps the place was deserted .	if
2	40384	Not only did peter templeton 's distress seem genuine : no fingerprints , typed on the most common lexmark printer paper , succinct , untraceable .	The ransom note left under the child 's pillow bore all the hallmarks of an organized criminal operation .	but
4	68579	She could feel george trying to kiss her neck .	She saw the blonde sailor fly at him from .	when
0	18235	19 2 the night was clear .	The sun was nowhere in sight .	and
1	109022	Hunter felt himself pale .	Mainly he could see his friend doing it .	because
4	64110	Legends of miraculous healing dating back to the roman period .	St. paul landed on malta .	when
1	54800	I just want you to be okay with it . '' .	I 'm okay with it and i want you to be .	because
2	150875	She needed to get moving on her plan .	How could she leave for the university of her choice when it was almost a hundred miles .	but
2	51421	She wanted him to yell at her .	He did n't . .	but
0	110227	Asper took a step .	The longface 's grin grew broader .	and
3	49802	Judge loopus then asked each juror .	He or she thought a unanimous verdict could be reached .	if
0	24638	Shade takes the young baby from petra .	Stands up to make a speech .	and
2	115253	It felt like ages since kian had picked me up after school last week .	There had been no date this weekend since i was grounded .	but
0	136406	Arkady immediately set up as a hero for her benefit .	Paraded back and forth to re-enact the encounter .	and
1	52636	He leaned in even closer .	There was more he needed to know .	because
3	3796	He 'd damn wel give them to her .	She needed the words .	if
0	36796	Lea ducked the punch .	Stood up with a left uppercut to hilda 's chin .	and
0	17708	He flung the door open .	Got up to his feet .	and
4	136471	How can i help the districts .	Every time i make a move , it results in suffering and loss of life .	when
2	90588	Sasha asked me to wake you earlier ; you were all sleeping .	I couldnt bring myself to do it .	but
1	80578	Oh , and he almost forgot - the stacker truck in the dispatch stores must have been parked with the handbrake .	It had run away and crashed into a pile of empty drums .	because
2	66713	I was beyond drained .	I had just enough fire left to make this point .	but
2	97404	I start grabbing my boomerang .	When i see what 's in their hands .	but
0	106719	He bundled the baby up , stopping at the first farm he came to .	Rode into the valley .	and
0	129241	Wrath went over to the desk .	Ran his hands down the carved edges .	and
1	58973	I was going to have to go to the grocery store at some point .	I did plan on staying , which meant i needed food .	because
3	71997	It will lock and i 'll have to spend the night without him .	A door shuts between us .	if
4	121164	My dad started beating the shit out of me .	I was young and an early death always kind of seemed inevitable .	when
2	23556	Not she 'd do anything more than laugh in his face .	It would be nice to beasked once in a while .	but
0	76471	He cupped her mound .	Felt the small rush of liquid response .	and
2	36737	I wanted to let my fingers roam free .	My hand was inconveniently frozen in place .	but
0	117962	I sighed kept looking .	Pretended to sip my black coffee .	and
0	143878	Stanley lowered his head , yet he was smiling .	Color mounted in his cheeks .	and
3	132200	And , ill tell you exactly whats going on .	You let me finish .	if
0	11601	But she was also tired .	There was little she could do until the last of the drug wore .	and
3	9474	It would be a good idea . '' .	I left the two of you .	if
0	10207	Avaris pushed aside the hair .	Though the dead warriors face was bloated , his sharp nordic features were still recognizable .	and
2	3944	He caught up with her and .	Grasping her arm , turned her .	but
0	103781	Nathan started walking and start chuckling .	Saw the men smile .	and
4	81390	Dear god , what would he do .	He was displeased with her .	when
4	85731	But , i found it hard to say no .	Garrett would ask me to do things .	when
2	99276	Money certainly wasnt everything .	It paid the sometimes very large bills that his research sometimes generated .	but
2	52975	You may be right ? '' .	If my father goes to jail and my mother bails on me forever , what 's left .	but
2	30697	He 'd awoken two hours ago with his head aching and his shoulder on fire .	Ignoring the young healer who 'd insisted he remain in bed , he 'd gone in search of the mave .	but
0	126708	No one was there to drop me off at the ferry .	I was running too late for the bus .	and
0	151935	He got up : and lucy went with him , laying a rather tremulous hand on his mane .	Walked with stately , noiseless paces back to the belt of dancing trees through which she had just come .	and
0	144959	He wanted to preserve it he wanted to get to know it .	It was wrong to `` own '' this woods , but .	and
3	33134	Theyd throw open the doors and throw us a banquet .	We suddenly win the lottery they 'll want to know us alright .	if
3	70004	Within minutes , max felt .	Some sort of magic spirit were flowing through his veins .	if
3	83907	That memory will be erased from her mother 's mind .	The memory serum virus is deployed .	if
0	85864	But there were other times when i saw him looking at me .	I knew he was wondering if he 'd really done the right thing by returning to the academy .	and
4	113551	She said , `` winnie told her to .	I raised an eyebrow .	when
0	73227	As the pair left , he walked to the front door .	Tracked the sedan 's taillights .	and
2	131003	No , i didnt see her face .	Her clothingi should have twigged to it .	but
4	22812	They 'd imprisoned the titans , and hades , who had helped zeus claim the throne , was deemed uncontrollable and imprisoned .	The greeks had taken over the heavens .	when
0	1970	Who worked in the ministry .	Had been cautioned her against blowing the whistle .	and
2	106314	Dammit , cole , '' i said .	I 'd deflated a little bit .	but
0	136719	She still loved him .	Had to do something to keep andrus from killing the queen-and therefore niccolo .	and
2	8153	He pressed his face up against the window to try and see further .	The track was dead straight and with the night deepening it was hopeless .	but
0	146235	Her to get up tie you to the chair .	Rip up a sheet .	and
0	8991	That he has never worked with .	The memory wipe doesnt take .	and
0	125419	He was pacing along the road looking into the woods .	I could tell by the way he was walking that he was alert to danger .	and
4	123777	He experiences even more relief .	Burnett calls to apologize for being too busy to drive down to help move frank to the shady lea .	when
0	127240	Shade gently butted alexs chest with his snout .	It brought him out of his thoughts .	and
2	119398	He understood her intentions .	Also knew that she would flatly deny any allegations of generosity , for fear that it should tarnish her image .	but
4	124326	Id barely taken three steps .	One of the stoners said , what a creep .	when
2	97687	Many people were outraged at the expense while our nation was at war , and mrs. knowlton has put the room to good use .	They have retracted their indignation since the war ended .	but
2	113617	They recognized stravinsky in the music .	It was like nothing they ever had experienced .	but
0	43670	`` then , barlow , come over here . '' .	See about this bastard .	and
4	140721	I was just telling him about it .	Simon drove up in the porsche .	when
2	122535	The door moves again-not with the force of a tornado , like .	Instead with a rattle and shake .	but
0	54884	You see one mortal woman tortured to death for seducing a guard .	You remember it for the rest of your life .	and
4	81986	And , teresa , it will be your idea .	We do have sex .	when
3	51343	You can reach her at : ksteed6302 @ comcast.net .	You want to be on her mailing list or if you just want to chat about the book youve read .	if
4	36268	The intention was to give somebody else a casting vote if we disagreed over anything important .	We set up the business .	when
1	66979	I cant be sure .	Everything sounds muffled and distorted .	because
1	143039	To return a large award .	None of the money will go to their personal checkbooks .	because
1	67445	The baby had been left with her .	Silence 's brother , winter , ran the home for unfortunate infants and foundling children .	because
2	134737	He didnt know the woman .	He liked what he had seen .	but
2	40211	Thank you for asking . '' .	I 'll be okay .	but
2	148060	It was a small jab .	It was a jab .	but
0	92835	Small bear met them at the inner gate .	Walked with them up the trail towards the cube , where laura and two bears already watched and waited .	and
1	93480	To take it out .	The effect was so damn good that he did not want to fuck it all up by moving any .	because
0	157888	Red and blue lights were flashing at the entrances .	More were lighting up the night at all corners of the parking lot .	and
2	66238	You 're more important than the meeting .	I should call ahead if i 'm going to be .	but
2	119633	We might be on a social call .	It was going to be about power .	but
0	126733	I stared at her .	Guessed she was maybe in her early forties and aging .	and
2	140796	He wasnt a peach .	Now hes got no morality .	but
2	46305	She may have been the first victim .	Certainly wasnt the last .	but
3	155457	To say its good .	You think its stupid .	if
4	108939	What we need to know is . '' .	He left , on what ship , who went with him , and where he was to land .	when
0	10849	Obligingly lunging out across the deck , to throw them overboard , who had risen to their feet and approached laurence .	Seizing a couple of men in her jaws .	and
3	114214	I would 've smiled .	Anything about this was funny .	if
2	52983	I found her lighthearted jibes endearing .	I doubted the man i just sent writhing on the ground felt the same way .	but
0	134641	He had showered while i was dressing .	I realized that he had a bag stuck just inside my door .	and
0	70141	The light pink bruise on her cheek had faded .	She smoothed a layer of foundation on her skin with her fingertips .	and
2	92871	I was allowed three hours of personal `` free '' time every day .	Only all homework was completed .	but
3	6290	My life would be complete . '' .	I could actually post a review on something other than the school library computers .	if
2	12924	Its ranks are not just the poverty-stricken classes .	Include a cross section of educated and wealthy people .	but
1	149529	Violet loved those few moments when he was between sleep and consciousness .	He was so relaxed and peaceful , so much more himself than he was during the workday .	because
0	2550	Looking around the suddenly hushed room .	Challenging them all with his eyes .	and
0	128018	Looking at all the pictures .	Listening to her music .	and
3	76896	He tries to decide .	He should tell ellen .	if
2	42777	I looked for him , anxious that we might be depriving him , and some of them were filing away from the factory .	A german officer was already dividing the men into groups .	but
3	18710	`` , '' general yulan continued .	It pleases the highest daughter .	if
3	86251	We must survive this war .	We are to return our master to his temple .	if
2	133845	Madrigal 's skin went hot as her heart grew cold , and rise she must , and did .	She dropped into a curtsy from which she wished that she never had to rise and meet his eyes .	but
2	20293	He called me back a second later i tossed my phone on the table and ignored it .	He could say anything and .	but
4	11101	The women own everything , and we spend our lives protecting their possessions . ' .	You get right down to it .	when
4	111271	He sniffles and straightens his spine .	He sees me looking at him .	when
4	93284	I had to do a double take .	I pushed open the door .	when
2	21631	I 'd tried my best to see his memories .	Something had always stopped me .	but
2	123573	You can have me for whatever purpose .	You have to let laiken go .	but
2	16309	Lacey 's out of town . '' .	She 's supposed to give me a call tonight .	but
0	34747	Upon reaching the mountains , ghads people enter a large cave .	Begin tunneling a new hive .	and
3	124407	He 'd be dead inside .	Anything happened to his woman .	if
2	38664	Neither i nor my father had the power to turn into anything .	My red thirst came on me monthly , in what seemed a lunar cycle-although it did not always coincide with the full moon .	but
3	47170	Garrett i will never talk to you .	You even think of throwing me in the river .	if
0	13938	Well , i guess each of us hears someone talking , he had said at last .	You can bet your bottom dollar on one thing , sweetie : each of us - includ-ing this here reverend murdock - hears that voice say just exactly what he wants to hear .	and
2	115689	In which you do not believe .	We would better get going .	but
0	124503	Raphael set me down on my feet jumped , flipping in midair , kicking at the opening i had made .	Took a running start .	and
3	113994	`` , then your enemies will target your own . '' .	You target the young .	if
4	48518	My wish came true .	I heard the stealthy sounds of movement in the brush not fifty yards from me .	when
2	96082	Half my instincts are screeching at me not to put the filthy dress on and go out into public looking so disheveled .	The other half of my instincts , the ones connected to the pills , are conflicting with how i was brought up .	but
4	68045	He had just about decided on an oriental vase .	Another woman , the attractive middle-aged blonde , entered the room .	when
4	120631	The town emptied into the forest with their gear : helmets , boots , axes , chain saws , and trucks .	The fire broke out .	when
0	121044	King scratched his unshaven jaw .	I wondered what it felt like to be him .	and
4	75238	She realized that his anger was toward her .	Azalea directed her attention toward dylinn .	when
2	22559	We were better every time we played .	We needed structure : verses and choruses , a drummer .	but
3	134625	What i knew would kill me .	I allowed myself to understand it .	if
2	134762	I had the urge to curl my hand around it out of view , so i ignored her stare to say , `` it 's about cole . '' .	That would give away more than i wanted .	but
2	148327	Wont be able to say you can stay here another night or two till tiffa and i compare stories .	It is true i must first give my thanks for punishing them boys for what they did .	but
0	132124	`` set your course northeast , '' laurence said , `` , so we may best watch for land ; make sure iskierka and kulingile have lanterns for the night . '' .	Keep as far apart from the others as you can and still be in sight of one another .	and
0	109443	She had the ability to see spirits ; she is perhaps a more powerful magic-user now in death .	Learned spirit magic in life .	and
3	93208	Full well marcy would follow .	She could find a way to shimmy out of her end of the deal .	if
0	63614	She saw a friendly smile in his eyes .	She knew he had a good heart .	and
4	44501	It 's hard not to be a little jealous .	You 're pictured on tv with someone .	when
0	150849	For breakfast he threw a couple of old potatoes into the fire .	Then he melted some snow in a pot for drinking water .	and
3	68666	You 're going to feel crappy about making fun of me . '' .	I have a concussion .	if
0	122484	This weapon is called a glaive .	It was given to dad 's people to defend their empire .	and
0	158245	He has never used it before never knew it was .	It was born with him , but .	and
2	52502	As he slows at a red light , it looks like he wants to say more .	I look out to the side window , not giving him the opportunity .	but
4	63836	She asked how high .	Her father asked his wife to jump .	when
0	75553	He tugged on his short beard .	Returned to his work .	and
1	35340	And as before , it made her want to kick him .	It sounded kind of like ses-sahn-the way someone with his accent might say the name susan or suzanne .	because
1	34733	We can kill them .	They know that we 're a threat to them .	because
3	94502	It would content them . '' .	Perhaps it were your pleasure that i should be a marshal of the lists .	if
0	41946	She growled something undecipherable to herself .	Opened the door with the hole that the missing knob had created , and slammed it behind her before ashton had even arrived .	and
2	13141	Betty accepted the chain .	Then handed it back , saying , `` too heavy .	but
3	143631	They give less attention to military matters .	The soldiers worry about the safety of their families .	if

4	46522	To leave with him .	Her life was already so concrete .	when
3	88817	Though , well get you to a hospital .	I feel its too bad .	if
4	159424	Jules looks under the stalls to be sure we 're the only ones .	We all get in the bathroom .	when
0	65037	She had won no friends by freeing the kingslayer .	More than once she had heard the greatjon say that women had no place on a battlefield .	and
4	38729	Thoughts of her came to him at the damnedest moments-like .	He was trying to make love to mary .	when
0	142551	She stood from the swing .	Began to run too , reaching out toward me .	and
3	39089	Oh god , was the rest .	The kissing was real .	if
4	39430	`` and , you will have gained the answer to that question as well , '' .	You do find the person who created the book and summoned you .	when

3	147199	How d'you know all this ? '' .	You 've had no direct contact with him .	if
2	44977	There were four of them .	Only one seemed interested .	but
3	55872	It would 've been so much easier .	Grandpa 's house sat somewhere off a main road .	if
0	139013	The niche in the side of the strange , stair-stepped peak was more than large enough to conceal them .	They moved down into it .	and
0	17517	Two years ago he went facedown during a concert .	Right after that , he went missing .	and
4	29145	She 'd seen the hunger in his eyes .	She 'd watched todd .	when
3	139997	Every step of the way .	You 'll let me .	if
2	51124	You will make mistakes along the way .	You will grow , you will learn .	but
2	48368	She tried thinking of something to say herself .	Had spent the past several years trying to avoid conversation with everyone but emilie , leaving the queen 's solar and roaming the garden and castle on her own .	but
3	141816	You are what you are because evolution favored your genes .	Even you might not know the darwinian explanation for every gene you have .	if

4	107126	Lunged at the mouse .	It tried to scurry from the corner it was in .	when
2	14549	Trak has solved the mystery of iron making .	After considering the situation further becomes fearful .	but
2	68111	Distance and sizes were hard to judge .	I knew it had to be fifty feet or more across .	but
4	158674	It 's so different .	I 'm with him .	when
2	58545	I 'd feared we would arrive .	Now i could relax a little .	but
0	50274	Ho yanked off ono of his chains , swinging the croaturo 's body around to block the othor ghouls ' clutching , battoring hands .	Started strangling a bloodsuckor with it .	and
0	78260	I 'll run up , then maybe we can watch a movie eat ice cream . '' .	Take a quick shower .	and
2	135920	Fastillion couldnt understand the words he used .	From the way that antler-man held up his arms while he faced the tabletop , it seemed that he preached or tried to summon the attention of his wicked cannibalistic gods .	but
4	56080	She would smack it back down , reminding herself that her only worth was in what she could do .	Her conscience tried to rear its ugly head .	when
2	118430	Chaeli struggled to sit up in his arms .	He held her fast , his hands roaming across her body with the possessiveness of a child and their toy .	but
2	30586	Langdon opened his mouth .	Still no words came .	but
2	106382	And i know it shouldnt .	Knowing im not the only one who took advantage of our ability and did bad things to other people whether they deserved it or not , lessens my guilt .	but
3	85348	Directly she would have told him to go fuck himself and left without a backward glance .	Willard had given her this assignment .	if
2	38570	It seems like a strange descriptor for someone with as much money and resources as you have . '' .	Clearly you still do it .	but
4	107441	She was drifting , did that mean there were other mythical creatures like werewolves and zombies lurking in the shadows .	From out of nowhere , she found herself wondering how many other vampires were wandering around the countryside and since vampires were real .	when
0	114017	After a few seconds his arms came around her back .	He squeezed her close , pressing his face into the hollow of her neck .	and
3	109827	And , she 'd still find herself obliged to follow her father 's dictates .	Even she did not end up marrying either of the two dukes of wyndham .	if
0	71962	Giving her a crooked grin , he leaned into her car turned the key .	Reached across the steering column .	and
2	29004	Jax offered his arm .	She waved him off .	but
0	148649	My academic studies at eton college were finally complete .	I was jubilant at the prospect of beginning my term as an instructor at the very same college .	and
2	2463	It flashed out too fast for me to follow with my gaze .	The knife in maximus 's hand was suddenly several feet away on the floor .	but
2	134254	Alec lashed out with a fist .	Haste threw off his aim .	but
2	68959	Casting their lures into the waters .	Apart from an inquisitive stare from a cow in the field opposite .	but
0	14163	Temeraire rumbled softly , deep in his throat . '' .	Called , `` majestatis , ballista - it is time to get everyone up .	and
3	73344	Virgil and peyton would raise mia and jake .	Anything happened to her .	if
2	48958	He closed it and nothing seemed to come out .	Reopened it multiple times .	but
2	9266	Normally i 'd suspect foul play .	Your mom is as straightlaced as they come .	but
4	76210	Why i love i dont blame you .	I can escape to the forest .	when
2	120001	Her lungs began to burn , her eyes were raw from straining to see .	She continued onward , heedless of the pain starting to seize hold of her body .	but
3	87217	No amount of strength could have kept his hands on the guideline .	He had tried to stand .	if
0	36331	He should have already disappeared into his bedroom .	Taken his limoncello with him .	and
0	56139	It announced a gathering at the humble home of magnus the magnificent warlock . '' .	Promised attendees `` a rapturous evening of delights beyond your wildest imaginings .	and
0	18314	Lather still dripping down his shirt , he pulled vetinari 's sealed letter out of his pocket .	Slit it open with the razor .	and
2	91489	Ben made a good point .	Considering the island is covered in trees it would be challenging to find a spot without them .	but
2	44350	Most leave here with pockets full of money . '' .	All who return have nothing but empty in their pockets .	but
3	143584	The infection began spreading .	So we are lucky we will find some handy stuff .	if
0	6621	I worked the handle .	Allowed the energy to flow .	and
3	118127	How malphas was stocking his troops .	They were all new , i was a little worried .	if
2	16376	I chalked his lack of decorative skills to the fact that he was male , or he 'd refused to .	It felt like he 'd never really settled .	but
2	19456	Mel would eat 'em . '' .	She wanted to give 'em a funeral .	but
2	114796	I was over him in my day-to-day life .	My subconscious missed him .	but
2	150695	Allison used to be best friends with nicole johnson .	Then she developed and guys started paying attention to her .	but
4	93587	That was the moment .	Mordred deschain came closest to despair .	when
0	11332	The kingslayer descended on them put them to flight .	Uncle edmure had sent lord vance and lord piper to hold the pass , but .	and
2	68499	Friedas stepson had told her about the graves he found .	She had refused to believe him .	but
0	109586	You think my genes look pretty hot . '' .	I 'm not talking about the ones painted onto my ass .	and
4	13050	The love i felt .	I looked at his precious face sent my head spinning .	when
4	85281	Was out on parole .	She worked for me .	when
2	154159	At our approach , the driver reached for my backpack .	I shook my head .	but
2	156913	The only light was from the street lamp , which was .	It would have to do .	but
3	14128	And there at the end ... `` i will go with them peacefully . '' .	You will keep them from her .	if
2	21768	She 's smoking a cigarette when we walk by she focuses on us .	Staring out at the parking lot .	but
2	8696	I 've only got the one .	We 're not far from the car .	but
3	50506	Then added , `` .	You 're going to use it on your man , best be sure he 's dead drunk first .	if
2	64827	Danny knew he was being used .	So far jack had been up front and honest about it , which was a lot more than most informants were .	but
4	39680	Little dolldolls shouldnt move themselves .	Wolfe plays with themso this is for your own good he reached back for a windup and threw me across the room and headfirst into the concrete .	when
3	103025	She could climb down to the clearing .	She came out above the falls .	if
3	90809	But then please , my pass is still good for the rest of the day .	You can not stay .	if
1	87032	It must have showed .	She held my hands and started to cry .	because
2	86373	It 's very rough .	You might like to give comments .	but
3	126572	You can bring harry potter .	You really have to .	if
0	37023	Luc stood , resignation in his features .	Scrubbed his hands through his curly locks .	and
1	32491	This was her place even more than the house .	She had worked on everything in it at one time or another .	because
0	123469	The roast beef was tender , just the right side of rare .	Exactly what i wanted .	and
0	29471	I struggled to keep my voice steady .	To stop myself from turning around .	and
2	8477	The police vans siren had long died out .	Its lights continued to rotate about the whole lobby and bar area through the windows adding to the glow of the bar lighting .	but
2	31919	I wanted to lie down and cry .	The herbs were kicking in , and my depression was giving way to a numbing exhaustion .	but
2	110096	My understanding is the guys stateside tried to serve a few warrants .	All the suspects disappeared before they could grab anybody .	but
2	134558	The list of things i had to do was growing .	My energy seemed to be lessening .	but
4	79187	To take any chances with the law .	The government still had her money .	when
4	49295	We 'll know for sure .	We do the ultrasound around week twenty .	when
4	47773	What adrian had signed up , but somehow his dewy assistant did not seem to mind .	He joined the office of internal review .	when
4	91874	I 've probably got the biggest identity crisis of all time going , so if i want to drop one lousy letter from my name , i think i 'm entitled .	You stop to think about it .	when
2	71937	I just -- i started to explain .	He cut me off .	but
0	127863	But krystal had no words for what was wrong with obbo .	Even if she had , she would not have wanted to talk about him .	and
0	14984	Just look at him .	Focus on his eyes .	and
0	101677	They 're still out there . '' .	They have to be stopped for good .	and
4	26714	Now i am wondering how come we even landed in this conversation .	We have such bigger issues on our head .	when
4	128090	He rolled his eyes .	He turned back to us but the love for his mom was obvious .	when
0	125208	Hailey got more tense .	Demanding as the birthing day approached .	and
2	83687	Being here doesnt make me less afraid .	Being close to him eases it .	but
4	31287	On the whole they were more receptive .	I first came to the microphone .	when
3	83767	Even jesus would pick up his skirts and run in the opposite direction .	He saw my mother coming .	if
2	159330	There is much to tell , '' doyle said , `` . '' .	Let it wait for a later time .	but
2	109438	He smiled and . '' .	Said , `` let me give you a tip .	but
2	73059	He made perfect sense .	She couldnt give in .	but
0	136968	Cassie threw her arms .	Blasted it into his face .	and
0	142090	The first lo - if sextus perished during a holding action , that implies that there was still organized resistance .	It might still be .	and
0	27390	Who werent afraid to rub our noses in the dirt when we screwed up .	You happened to get on their bad side ... look out .	and
0	140817	I have several valuable first editions in here , given the wretched humidity on this island .	The temperature is climate-controlled to keep them in pristine condition .	and
0	109665	Netiro flapped his encrusted wings .	To his surprise , the mud seemed to just melt .	and
0	159348	The glow of victory , of success , yet lingered .	Carried the day : perceval stood and put his hands flat on the table .	and
4	142359	Said almeric , a note of accusation in his voice .	I was at your place .	when
2	104698	Maybe i 'm a little lacking in social graces , and ... '' she lifted a shoulder and let it drop .	Maybe i never let people get .	but
0	145304	The patriarch of kadach was the compromise candidate of the faction opposed to annias .	He spoke with a certain authority .	and
4	69629	To fight alongside them . '' .	Needed and there should be no animosity toward them .	when
1	18877	Which she had anticipated .	It was a certainty that the guardian pack would cross the track of the invaders and be waiting ... all a dream .	because
0	114524	He lifted a hand .	Traced the shadows under her eyes .	and
1	145357	Dagdron and elloriana eventually dropped back close to the bowl to fend off any goblin that got near it .	The warrior and lady warrior were fighting so ferociously that the goblins were making very little headway .	because
0	2419	Aiilyn retreated , but i kept my head locked in place , looking down over the side of the ledge .	I wanted nothing more than to look after her and she where she was going .	and
2	50309	It had been years since the night curtis dissected the bat-thing .	I was thinking about it .	but
0	84735	Skyla gazes into the vial , black as midnight with the hint of a crimson hue .	Loses herself in the necrotic color .	and
0	86763	He flattened his hand on her belly .	Gently rubbed as he searched his mind for any reference to such an institute .	and
3	74272	`` , then they already know we 're sitting here behind these shrubs . '' .	They have the technology to be here , which should be next to impossible .	if
3	48913	Instead of being truthful with him about her emotions .	What , as she 'd thought she should be , she 'd only pressured him .	if
0	39725	Sometimes , under his gaze , she felt as if she were exposed and naked .	She had to hurry to hide .	and
3	34438	Why are we getting on a plane ? '' .	Death is hunting me .	if
2	16928	Buzz was still in his wetsuit .	His mask was pulled back on his forehead .	but
4	109923	He was worried that a stray bullet would hit him .	His arrogant boss made him drive around the hood looking for trouble .	when
3	5374	Even when it felt like the man she loved more than life had abandoned her , then it would have meant paige could also have survived .	Mairi had been able to cope .	if
2	29710	I had clung the idea so eagerly , that i almost forgot the plan had been his .	Accepted their ways and life so much more easily than zach .	but
3	129486	`` then maybe we 'll consider going . '' .	They make it to the other side .	if
3	104247	Oh , an answer ill think about it .	Well you can get .	if
4	31817	The colors in her hand glowed .	She opened her eyes .	when
0	71999	Nothing made sense , here was a face from lyghts past , a dead past , coming up again in the most bizarre of circumstances .	To underline that sense of confusion .	and
2	3370	They used to belong to the army .	We just got them a very young air force sergeant , who turned out to be the crew chief/loadmaster , explained .	but
3	91564	I can tell you , no matter how bad duke wants you to go over .	Goliath isnt in on it , it aint happening .	if
4	137680	Chapter 3 now , this is .	It really gets weird .	when
2	119468	Gabriel swung downward in a powerful stroke .	Belial met it with the tip of the spear , deflecting the blow .	but
0	119081	You must go to the dreadful wilds where the griffin lives ; . '' .	Then he will follow you and stay .	and
2	102068	The woman would be her , and zeke is the one who said he didnt trust her to keep quiet .	Then we all started talking about it .	but
2	21223	I know youre here fighting for me .	I need to know if youll always be here , or if youll run off again , the next time the lycanthru attack .	but
2	71715	My response appeased crusoe .	He undoubtedly felt skeptical about my spontaneous emergence on the island .	but
2	52906	Sweat was beading up across my forehead with the effort it was taking to move to the top of the stairs .	When i got there , i saw evan , at the bottom and he looked scared .	but
2	158158	Donovan caine and i might have an agreement .	Our tenuous partnership might not keep him from sneaking out in the middle of the night .	but
2	129274	I wanted to go .	Donovans concern , his warmth on my shoulder , made me doubt .	but
2	98874	I usually stayed clear from him and his friends and noticed he seemed off .	Never made much eye contact .	but
2	137492	Might be a little rotten .	When she was new she was very [ caller rolls r 's , turning the word into `` verrry '' ] tasty .	but
4	58395	I notice a red car driving eerily slow behind me .	I 'm close enough to see my grandparent 's house in the distance .	when
0	34136	The woman glanced at it .	Wrote something down on a clipboard .	and
2	21626	That paul had a temper and dark side .	Over the years frank had convinced himself he 'd never take his fury out on his own family .	but
2	126195	Yes , it was rougher than it should have been .	She 'd brutally beaten him for centuries and then tried to kill his wife .	but
2	150913	I 've acted like that girl . '' .	That 's not me .	but
0	75223	Twice we sent the child to ibea have i seen him .	Both times he stood with the mother in the fields , planting crops and harvests .	and
3	120252	I wouldve done it .	He really wanted to .	if
2	119759	Margaret , we have had news before .	Naught comes of it .	but
2	6155	It was a hot lunch .	The offerings looked suspect and the broccoli casserole looked soupy .	but
0	74584	He was ramon espejo .	That was his own money he was taking .	and
0	71190	Based on the manner in which the demon claimed them , slowly and by careful deception that would have hidden its identity from them , they must have passed .	Come back scarcely realizing the transition .	and
3	15180	I will show you where to put your bags .	You will follow me .	if
2	75315	The grass was newly trimmed , and yes , had you been paying proper attention , you could have noticed the imprints of my feet on the lawn .	I stamped around a bit before i chose my spot .	but
4	1006	You sometimes have to do things you 'd never do if things were going good .	You get into a bad fix .	when
3	7995	Feel free to share .	You can think of something .	if
3	122916	I did not know .	It was your world that he lived and died on .	if
0	92502	Deny me . '' .	Things will grow more difficult .	and
2	48702	Its bigger than at home , he answered with his mouth full .	I had strange dreams .	but
4	51017	Her talked into a quickie .	He heard motors gunning behind them and a series of annoying beeps .	when
0	20772	Without sight , his work would have to stop .	There would be no hope in changing their fates .	and
3	145135	We wont be short of questions .	We ever get to meet this half-sister of yours .	if
3	137279	They were wary of places near water .	Even most of them were deserts .	if
3	150999	Even a small shadow in the clerk and mitro had put it .	There was a sliver .	if
0	144049	She was all in black .	She had mud on her face but she was very thin .	and
0	105853	A mighty wind was blowing against us .	The sound of the ocean waves crashing on solid rock below was terrifying .	and
0	25988	Khalad opened the leather pouch he had brought .	Took out a length of sausage .	and
1	149649	Mitch was figuring he didnt want to know anything about it .	Since his wifes death , arland had gone from being casually annoying to a full-blown eccentric .	because
2	48046	Jake would find an opportunity to pay her back .	It did feel good to tell him off .	but
2	23825	I try to shake my head .	I 'm slowly going numb so i 'm not sure if it works .	but
2	98446	The point is i know i made the mistake of not emphasizing the importance of knowing what it means to be black , korean , and a woman in todays society to jayla .	I dont want to put too much on her at once , you know .	but
0	100696	She leaned closer to him .	Her thighs slid against his hips .	and
3	108475	How my parents ran away with their third child .	What i told you and abandoned my saudara and me .	if
0	133157	I sit down on the bed rest my head in my hands .	Rake my fingers through my hair .	and
0	57137	I tried to turn my head .	Got admonished by salazar .	and
3	28056	She would be forty-five or fifty .	She waited until her children were grown to become a vampire .	if
2	144591	One of them was .	Mccutchen had killed plenty of fast before .	but
4	93022	She was truly drunk .	She lifted the glass to her mouth .	when
3	116929	Not the fourth-dimensional coordinate was required .	It was on the same world , or to a different planet , or even to a parallel world ( of which existed an infinite number .	if
4	36008	You give more of your soul to petty men more powerful than you in exchange for material comfort .	You become a man , and the light of your soul has dimmed to a filthy spark , and you no longer believe in anything .	when
4	115740	When the bad men came , velvet knew she had her parents on her side .	At least she was eighteen .	when
2	88672	Mason still didnt like the idea of walking around with a chip buried inside of him .	The idea of life without access to all of the information provided by his phone was even less palatable .	but
2	60221	He usually does this .	He 's been on my case a lot this year since we 've been playing .	but
0	72951	A rock tore at my shoulder .	I stopped for a moment .	and
1	10201	You 're lousy with juries .	You try to sway them with dry facts instead of emotional logic .	because
0	155524	He laid aside the cloth .	Picked up a long strip of linen .	and
0	20306	She would be removed , presumably with all gentility .	The savage ceremony would continue as it had for centuries .	and
2	87914	There were the exotic forms too , the were-buffalos and wereserpents .	The buffalos formed their own herd in the midwest and the serpents were solitary .	but
0	90268	`` second , who are you and ? '' .	What the hell are you doing .	and
3	160161	It was that my role was never to ask questions .	There was one thing i knew .	if
0	4380	Did you know your housekeeper can handle a knife like a street fighter ? '' .	Has no qualms about hacking people up with it .	and
0	84599	He and i were both satisfied .	We settled on duties , off-days and salary .	and
4	130057	I would wake up .	She got up to get ready .	when
2	7975	The cops were at the fbis beck and call .	Robert had stopped reporting in .	but
4	135415	Then straighten my cape .	She hands off the torn bread .	when
2	17787	On a practice field in the distance a coach blew a whistle and someone was yelling .	Neely barely heard it .	but
3	42862	And what would they do .	Even they did know .	if
2	97193	I darent take my eyes off honour .	I know id find dalmar grief stricken if i did .	but
0	88787	Next i reverse the domino effect so the fallen boulders push each other .	I stabilize them in their original positions .	and
0	79083	All the drapery had been pulled across the bank of windows that overlooked the back gardens .	The flap door that he figured led into the kitchen had been barricaded by a weighty antique sideboard .	and
0	48032	I told her the good news about leela .	She shrieked again , this time with joy .	and
2	45445	Ezrina turns and it 's me she 's gazing at-holding me steady with my own steely gaze .	Looks into logan 's eyes .	but
0	99104	She felt the guilt surge up her throat .	Lodge in the back of her mouth .	and
1	6335	Afraid to let it out .	If she did , she might not be able to draw another .	because
4	160180	They wished id just finish the book .	I was at my wits end for the hundredth time .	when
2	130612	I almost ate a poisonous plant by accident .	The red haired womans father stopped me just in time , laughing at the prospect of me dying because of such a stupid mistake .	but
4	14470	That i 'll be concerned .	My judgment 's handed down .	when
3	88255	`` you 'd catch something . '' .	You made out with him .	if
0	8941	At the time various military groups in the island made their own flags .	Started expanding their territory .	and
1	113857	Ella was really into it , the famous norwegian painter who painted the scream .	It was rumored to have belonged to edvard munch .	because
2	141568	Exactly what she had in mind .	I was here and they were `` now hiring .	but
0	10402	Assassins had penetrated the citadel at night .	The faithful rivan warder , brand , had been killed .	and
3	5949	Anything that develops is strictly between us .	A man is attracted to me and i find him attractive .	if
0	143848	I walked out the front door of the mansion , ambled down the long driveway .	Headed for the iron gate at the front of the estate .	and
2	47367	To say , they were respected , sometimes admired , generally applauded for doing a job which logically had to be-done .	People never felt quite comfortable in the same room with them .	but
0	55994	The more they eat , the larger they will grow , ser barristan had warned her .	The larger they grow , the more they ' ll eat .	and
2	126047	He knew all of that .	It suddenly penetrated his mind on a deeper level than .	but
2	157109	It 's silent and i open my eyelids , half expecting her to be gone .	She 's watching me , her chest rising and falling with her breathing .	but
2	140559	The disease runs through the streets , taking their occupants by surprise .	Crosses the squares and breaks into the houses .	but
4	28922	Both dr. allende and the ob would be waiting , to hustle off natalie into intensive treatment .	They arrived at the circular drive for the sliding doors of the er .	when
2	4009	She may not be a natural intelligencer . '' .	She certainly is a natural pain .	but
0	144388	There they had a true tale out of him .	When he had told them all as it was , they slew him , and thrust him into earth beneath the cliff , but took his spoil and brought it to arnkel .	and
4	78280	I was a baby .	It happened and only found out about it a month .	when
0	20024	I never saw any groundsmen or caretakers in my forays through the gardens and woods .	I never attempted to enter the manor .	and
2	75976	I am willing to sit down and talk this out with you . '' .	You need to understand that i will not allow you to step foot off these grounds .	but
0	153398	His ancestors had been knights .	They had come to own the chalk by killing the kings who thought they did .	and
0	71131	The world is shattered , and it feels as though there is naught i can do to save them .	All countries are beset with war .	and
4	158769	She was only a hundred feet from the farmhouse .	A navy-colored audi passed .	when
2	108682	Merrill had given my envelope of cash to me .	I 'd handed all except five thousand back to him before i left .	but
1	55809	Madigan 's after me .	He wants revenge for his murdered soldiers .	because
4	81739	The tiny torch geoff had dropped .	Hed so suddenly departed life and shone it around randolphs direction .	when
0	143075	Tavi heard steps behind him .	Then a great dark form flashed past him in near silence , a bound that took it across the rough trail brutus 's passage had made .	and
4	31024	How much tanya would love all this attention .	She passes tommy 's truck .	when
3	33444	Do you mind ? '' .	I tell terese about this .	if
3	135878	You 're a fool .	You think i 'm going to let an evaluation keep me in this crappy job .	if
0	77973	The stage was set .	The onset of the growth of power over the people was underway .	and
2	74530	Not really , i got no fall bounty this year .	It was eating my grass .	but
0	45438	They have made their own farms .	Estates , and with some justice consider themselves entitled to be masters of their own fate .	and
1	96100	A tear dripped down her cheek , and she felt terrible for their daughter .	She was pretty sure skip had done exactly that .	because
3	31294	They were in the restaurant , eating .	Someone wanted to eat .	if
2	154272	I 'm not sure what an observatory is .	I do know this much : amy 's first memory of seeing stars is with her family , and mine is with a dead man .	but
0	140664	I was lying on my side in the top bunk .	He was just tall enough to have his head at my level .	and
4	62264	Cerena seemed very concerned .	Aleesha told her about the dragon headed staves and also the possibility that silva is trying to recall ungeth .	when
2	84426	It was unlike him to be cryptic .	He wanted to be sure to have the puzzle solved before he spoke .	but
3	137145	To approach the girl .	She had seen her .	if
3	50158	You may make selection to the provincial team .	You keep this up .	if
2	73320	Listen , i 'd love to let you guys out of here ... a student .	Someone 's been shot out in the parking lot .	but
0	133876	He caught her hands , lifting his head to look down at her face .	Drew them around his neck .	and
0	76231	His flanks were glossy chestnut .	The beard that covered his broad chest was goldenred .	and
4	108509	It functioned just fine .	It came to love .	when
0	114708	He never laughed never interrupted .	He blinked from time to time , but .	and
2	140499	He said nothing in response .	He could feel his cheeks beginning to redden .	but
0	105667	If we move quickly enough , i can cure bevier . '' .	Rid this house of its curse .	and
4	124424	Instead showing a strong , practical nature .	She nodded her head .	when
3	34093	On a split-second thought , i wondered .	He was doing this to make me jealous .	if
4	156159	He was a little relieved .	He saw cassandra , alisa and silver arrive from down the hall from alisas room , followed by sasha .	when
2	86464	Her face reddens with anger and i wait for her to unleash her wrath , instead she simmers down and steps .	Maybe even pull off the gloves .	but
2	159831	He wanted to flee .	She entered his personal space like she owned it and examined his face like a ruby .	but
2	15073	In theory , they were good sources of either free or cheap labor .	Jake had heard more bad stories than good .	but
0	114357	Kitai 's eyes widened .	She turned her head , following the line indicated by tavi 's finger .	and
4	30156	But , she began to shake harder and her body strained toward his sweaty skin and the hot breath that pulsed from his mouth as he panted from exertion and excitement .	The warmth of his fingers penetrated the thin hospital gown .	when
0	136581	The water level rose past their waists , but were able to refill their water skins at least .	They became soaked as well as exhausted .	and
4	82842	Her to be angry at the mouse .	She peeked over and saw it was curled up into a ball , sound asleep on the bedding it had stolen .	when
3	62872	And it could not be .	Your world has no floating lands .	if
4	108766	That setoni studied the little bent head while she carefully and slowly read out loud .	Jonqi was with him .	when
0	122123	They must grow together as a team learn to rely on each other through the times of battle .	Sector 7 must not only train to be soldiers , but .	and
4	29034	Docks they were being pursued by a group in white combat harnesses .	These three joined us from the shuttle , looked like older ref-xx models .	when
3	19810	Going to camp was more important .	It might change zoey .	if
3	152056	She could handle the pain .	It were only her .	if
0	40004	The last thing they needed was a hoard of frithering ladies .	Blustering would-be heroes getting in their way .	and
0	71409	Yet each year he had to leave again , leave the job he loved .	It was hardly through choice .	and
0	98746	I darted back across the alley .	Slipped into a black hole .	and
0	15316	Goliath gazed down upon the man .	Became a bit intrigued .	and
2	64314	Victoria was confused by his angry tone and watched him walk towards the conference room .	Took the papers he handed her .	but
2	48971	She thought of the boy she 'd once known with the same name .	That was years ago , back in grade school .	but
2	90459	It was a good place , and a fine city , and a price that all good places have to pay .	There is a price to be paid for all good places .	but
0	47298	But he slid his fingers between his lips-even cold blood would be glorious to him .	Then the world went .	and
0	24799	You were a really bad person .	You knew you could steal another mans wife by killing him in his sleep .	and
4	58740	Youth was a relative term .	You talked about vampires .	when
0	146376	She gave him a very pointed look .	Then they walked out , leaving their drained bottles sitting on the table .	and
4	123423	You relax , assuming they cant really see you watching them , when they can totally see you .	Boys look back at you watching them in the darkness outside your well-lit window , but their expressions do not change .	when
2	157490	Wayne reaches up to catch the ball .	Drops it as soon as it hits his hands .	but
2	103806	I know ive always worn my heart on my sleeve .	This is getting ridiculous .	but
0	8017	But ash would never again kill a dark-hunter .	Send him into the agony of shadedom .	and
0	48268	I crab-crawled back until i bumped into the legs of the man sitting in the chair .	Looked up at him .	and
2	54872	The man is gone , we are happy .	We didnt do anything except suffer the pain he inflicted upon us .	but
2	33926	Maybe stan had been with him .	It was too late for that .	but
2	132493	The horses neighed in terror , the cavalrymen shouted .	Continued to push their mounts hard towards the other side .	but
4	128361	To get out of his car .	He 'd gotten her to her house .	when
0	98249	Ganton was a wicked leader .	Gatsby had the misfortune of being his son .	and
0	20953	She pours a layer of olive oil .	Turns up the flame on the gas stove .	and
2	141986	Last entry supreme being : i dont have time at present to personally thank gabriel for his useful intervention .	It was a great help and i am sure when he reads this he will know that i do appreciate his looking out for me .	but
3	21365	Then he can escort you .	You still need to leave .	if
2	134123	If anything ever happened to constance before she brought forth an heir , the elders on the national council would have the authority to select a councilman to be king .	For many years running , the council had been notorious for unpredictably reaching untimely stalemates over the most momentous decisions .	but
3	68739	I would have done it .	I had wanted to put a spell on you .	if
4	117583	All those old humphrey bogart movies had not been insane .	They 'd done close-ups like this .	when
2	30960	He looked like a butler .	Jacky knew he was n't . .	but
3	45835	Now i need to leave with the shred of dignity i .	You 'll excuse me .	if
0	136235	She knows all the letters .	How they make words .	and
2	96448	He gently removed them without disturbing the sleeping form of the warden .	Suddenly he was gripped by a sense of doubt .	but
0	116745	As he did so , however , his head bumped against a hard surface of solidified , root-entangled soil .	Though his mind was slow and dull from lack of oxygen , he understood his situation .	and
0	58514	Later , as he was leaving for the day , he saw burt .	Ed talking excitedly in a corner .	and
2	154293	As i stare at the roses , it 's as if the bareness of the room fades , and .	I 'm the princess entering her castle .	but
3	12221	He would feel endless pain .	He even tried to destroy it .	if
0	120326	Hopping down the branches , i slipped through the mage ward on the backside of the red tent .	Yes , helped myself to some of their grub while keeping my head down and staying in the darkness , which was harder than i expected thanks to all the damn bonfires .	and
4	80548	It was waving a cape before a raging bull .	She pulled the helmet off her head and shook out her hair .	when
4	125470	She tried not to flinch .	Noel touched her arms .	when
2	72966	Thank goodness but he stopped me , holding out his hand .	Mr. sayer , you shouldnt be up i went to him .	but
2	155795	Charles knew that was a lie .	He did feel some relief regarding montys well being .	but
2	131691	She looked up at him , hesitating .	Then made up her mind .	but
0	151802	A key was placed in the lock .	Turned and the door swung open .	and
3	149782	Not even close to rich .	You measure by dash 's standards .	if
0	140496	I should give it up .	Go out to portland to be an earth witch , set up a spell shop and ... '' my eyes started to .	and
4	87144	I never had any experience of that sort .	I tried it on .	when
0	86253	Maggie turned back to watch her husband dance , with his perfect posture and morality .	Realized she had gotten tired of living up to his expectations .	and
0	140869	She was led to a bed .	It felt wonderful to lay her head .	and
2	126106	Kim was too scared to fight .	Shane took some strips of cloth and wrapped her wrists and ankles tight before slinging her over his shoulder .	but
0	150001	Beside elyna , the black man threw back his head .	Laughed in utter delight .	and
4	92067	Once and for all ill believe it .	I see it but i hope it happens .	when
2	76676	Jenks was taller by four inches .	Kisten had done bouncer work at his club .	but
0	150789	To destroy what they 've left at citgo as bait of our own .	Then to strike them where they gather .	and
3	124279	I mean what happened in the hallway ; mrs. truance said that it was just a prank .	You mean the plant .	if
2	150419	She had thought of returning to her lab .	Now decided to stay .	but
0	157044	After losing his memory for awhile because of wilama , he had almost lost oaka , his foster brother and best friend .	Thought that he was gone .	and
0	2124	It was his bedtime ritual .	Helped him feel less out of place .	and
0	32784	You can walk away now , or you can lower your guard and i give my word to end it quickly . '' .	Live with the shame of your defeat .	and
2	86541	Not only what was .	What was n't . .	but
3	35728	In my life , i 'd be okay .	I never get defibrillated .	if
0	20072	Kids played in yards .	Ran between houses without fear .	and
2	91016	I asked mrs. grainger why he wears a mask .	She shook her head and refused to answer me .	but
2	82728	Mankind has forgotten us , the courts have abandoned us .	We are still as much a part of faery as summer and winter .	but
3	20980	She was more of a permanent mooring type .	That meant what she thought it meant but what did they have in common .	if
4	78871	Being bounced from the study .	They realized id fudged her paperwork , that i was a doctor , and that she only had one transplanted kidney .	when
2	36502	It was hard to do .	Somehow i managed to relax .	but
2	23375	Eleanor knew she was taking a chance being rude .	She hoped it would make dr. sparling uncomfortable enough to cut the interview .	but
3	27895	She 's the one who can do it .	There 's any hope of saving your dog .	if
3	6441	I would love to hear from you at : james_bailie @ rocketemail.com thanks .	You have other comments .	if
0	87137	He tasted blood in his mouth .	Knew she was bleeding .	and
2	139020	Granted , he had not spoken to her since the night they had made love , aside from when she 'd been .	He had foolishly thought she had felt the same way as him-knocked off his feet by their encounter .	but
3	17577	I could tell everyone that i 'd finally come face-to-face with mattias bradley .	I got access to a phone .	if
2	64952	I tried to forget the memories have pressed in on all sides and there 's no longer any hope of escape .	Tried to put the war behind me .	but
2	64157	Jonathan didnt want to lose it in front of dad .	His control was slipping .	but
4	109317	He had a smile for her .	She came back to his mouth .	when
0	148247	Tom stared at jack .	Gave him a quizzical grin .	and
2	95192	I was what they would become .	How and why they would become this was a mystery to all .	but
4	94614	A little moan escaping her .	That first hot taste met her tongue .	when
2	30077	As her torso was propelled out over the railing , she flailed her arms , trying to grab onto anything to stop her fall .	It was too late .	but
3	46161	Adrian ... how do you know ? '' .	You 're crazy or .	if
1	79824	You will die ? '' .	I 'm your mate .	because
1	55213	To use a detour or have to cross the street .	The sidewalk was ripped up or the construction company was using a wrecking ball .	because
2	27205	`` you 're kind of like a great book ... you know , you pick up a book at the bookstore because it has a beautiful cover ... but . '' .	It 's what 's inside that pulls you in .	but
0	129912	Keeping the head alive .	Getting it to talk .	and
3	103085	Christ , he 'd take a picture of that puss and make a calendar of the damn thing .	Jim was still alive .	if
0	85658	Hed bought from an argive .	Crewed with men from all over .	and
4	98490	She has tears in her eyes .	She drives me to the bus station .	when
0	79182	They finish their lunch .	Hurry back to the warehouse .	and
2	69227	He sent most of his work back to his brother , theo , in paris .	He gave quite a few paintings away to the locals .	but
0	79193	That had flown by .	There were glass domes where the eyes should be .	and
0	49570	Raj looked deeply into the large green eyes staring up at him .	He caught the look of disappointment sweep across the young mans face .	and
3	99156	It is bis business .	He wants to send you .	if
0	120757	Sir unhert looked at emelia sensing the break in the magical tension .	Realised that she was its source .	and
3	64930	You could have little ones of your own running .	You would just settle .	if
3	38176	`` , the transfer points .	Nothing else , they 'd lead us to the money sources .	if
0	144853	That had fallen to the floor .	Pushed open the door of the cage .	and
0	37886	`` we 'll get you home soon , '' meghan promised .	Turned back to me .	and
2	66704	Mary ann saw pouchet motion to the police at the edge of the crowd .	Meurthe caught the gesture and raised a hand to stop it .	but
2	48262	When he suddenly ducked inside a noodle bar , i gave chase .	Upon entering the premises , could not find him .	but
0	125691	There stood behind the iron bars .	Peered out with anticipation .	and
3	29266	It would be a cruelty on the part of mother nature , the bed , of some lucky gentleman .	A woman of such understated beauty , and surprisingly fiery a temperament as eleanor , was not destined to occupy the arms .	if
0	4770	Ho died with profossor sotrakian .	- `` ho is alivo .	and
4	10743	Thomas had made her feel at the kattenkabinet .	He 'd said all those lovely things to her .	when
2	128489	Emma 's colic attacks hit pretty much on target every day .	She still had some time left before she slept it off and re-energized for another screeching fit .	but
2	68072	Thorn had a lot of heart , and he hadnt been very good with his technique .	Could suffer a lot of pain .	but
0	92065	The others followed suit , sequestering caden and sydney .	Closed the door to the library behind them .	and
2	148008	* * * word of the humans carried through the horde with a ripple of excitement .	No one was really hungry .	but
2	5660	She has a yellow skirt on .	Her legs have been torn off from the knees .	but
3	123257	I 'll show you my face . '' .	You make my master and me as much money as you claim .	if
2	92548	Kiara wanted to chase him down and apologize .	He was too angry at her for that .	but
4	150306	What qhorin halfhand had said .	They spied the fire in the skirling pass .	when
2	13084	Oliver is sending operatives after him .	The crisis may be .	but
1	144070	Tuesday is our first workday of the week .	The shop is closed on mondays .	because
0	154728	So far they give up .	Wait for the thief to try his luck .	and
4	154854	A new window of uncertainty opened .	We passed the southern tip half an hour .	when
4	30569	History was always buried .	Even you know where to look .	when
3	63730	It probably didnt matter .	The lady had heard the conversation because it looked as if i might lose the shopper .	if
4	123262	He looked at me , smiling but then frowned .	He caught wind of my red , tear-filled , eyes .	when
0	5357	Adam took faye by the arm .	Tried to pull her from her seat .	and
1	65123	There was not enough evidence does mean hes still not responsible for what we all know we saw .	Just he was acquitted for that on campus car accident .	because
1	71209	The offer still stands .	`` ... `` conrad exhaled .	because
4	48100	Our plan to escape was discouraged .	The door slammed shut in our faces and locked .	when
4	152068	We beg for his help .	Were down but do we ever thank him for our trials .	when
0	60123	If he then captures her , he will re-program her .	Her present personality will be lost .	and
3	120654	Ara i 'd be in your room , with you-awake , or i 'd be at home , leaving you to rest . '' .	I was going to be at your house .	if
2	29752	The worm did turn , and .	I seemed destined for embarrassment .	but
4	98401	Sometimes even a quick jolt .	They very first touch .	when
2	144660	You owe me one hell of an explanation montgomery .	Ill see what i can do .	but
3	110015	I 'm getting so wasted he 'll regret it . '' .	Ridge is forcing me to go out .	if
2	96983	I asked him what he was worried .	He kind of clammed up on me .	but
4	20855	She knew she was going to have some bruises , but she didnt care .	Her ribs connected with the steering wheel .	when
2	79058	It grew until i thought the weight of it must be unbearable .	She never seemed to struggle .	but
0	111885	He fell to the ground .	Curled up into a ball as every sense he had was assailed .	and
0	104202	He gave the old woman a kiss on the cheek .	Grinned at the younger one .	and
3	127467	Maybe they would make a good couple , making people happytogether .	The mayor was just like her .	if
2	153187	Jack hated leaving lorna .	He dared not wait .	but
4	126723	To peter carey for inspiration foreword sonnet 12 .	I do count the clock that tells the time .	when
2	6167	Leaving alderaan was tempting .	There was too much that was now unknown .	but
2	71825	Katarina did what she could to scrub our tracks .	What we imagine is true-the mogadorians killing two seconds after we saw her fatal blog post-then they moved fast , and they could be racing towards our abandoned home .	but
3	66504	You 're staying in this house .	I have to tie you up .	if
0	116246	The eaters-of-the-young had finished trading .	They were heading out to the next colony .	and
0	123563	Then my mother 's words come back to me-there 's room in your heart to love more than one person .	She 's right , it 's a beautiful thing .	and
1	46113	The situation was perfect for us to be friends , we respected and understood the difficulties of having a long distance relationship , so neither of us ever crossed the line .	We could hang out and have fun , and even though we were both attracted to one another .	because
0	144321	In fact , nothing particularly noteworthy happened at all .	I was starting to think that i would get through unscathed .	and
0	136821	The chat program closed .	Entropy sent an e-mail .	and
2	140967	The trigger was pulled , the hammer clicked .	No explosive report followed .	but
1	28331	And thank you for that .	Now i 'll never know squat .	because
2	24512	I know it doesnt seem anything special .	It sounded an important thing for him .	but
0	123141	I was staring back at him .	Gripping the rolled-up apron in my hands .	and
0	36607	He redirects his focus on me .	Observes me momentarily before he scoots close enough that our knees touch and his heat spirals through my body .	and
0	30970	Had almost drowned before matt swam over .	Pulled them from the ice-cold waters .	and
2	145679	Jason was hurt , and hed pinned my arm to the floor .	I was trying to shoot the weretiger .	but
3	80443	I mean seriously he gets to stay .	It 's between the two of us .	if
0	35649	Kosai felt naked and vulnerable without his swords .	Walked back to his bunk with his arms tightly at his sides .	and
3	46116	He 'd consider it .	An offer was made. .	if
2	67377	It 's no excuse and on top of that , i 'm hormonal . '' .	Yesterday was a rough day .	but
0	30775	Once the leg was at least temporarily secure , the warrior called up to his companions above .	They cast down several ropes and a canvas sling .	and
3	141870	I can look out for her if she 's in the third-floor apartment . '' .	Your niece is disabled .	if
2	150776	They 'd been closing in on grace for days .	Somehow she 'd managed to elude them just when he was sure they 'd come upon her .	but
0	66550	However , all of them were stopped cold .	Rebounded off the impenetrable scales .	and
0	41826	She wouldve been a great asset .	You chose that other woman .	and
0	35352	Clicked in my mind .	I knew what the three pictures meant .	and
1	46622	Let alone pretend that he 's a business associate . '' .	He 's too well trained to make the mistake of asking for me in person in a small hotel like this .	because
0	149478	She jerked her head to the left .	Met the bright stare of a smiling woman .	and
0	11556	The ceo pushed his chair .	Prostrated himself on the floor .	and
1	127350	`` no , smart ass , it 's not , '' i say against her mouth .	He has a penis .	because
3	37747	The ones that you are truly looking for will never be answered from such contents and it would be best if you consider that he was destroyed the day of the ambush .	Even it gives you some type of physical answers .	if
2	70651	The last time we spoke , he was at the airport , i started .	Soon i was talking about my childhood , the things we used to do , places we went as a family , the way he was always there for me .	but
2	130671	A few areas were raw and red .	I washed the blood and dirt from my pores , decorating the drain in shades of black and red , even those areas began to fade , leaving my light brown skin creamy and smooth .	but
0	23837	Its trailing lower wings quivered , a pallid face gazing at them from the darkness .	The eyespots seemed to blink .	and
0	116074	When captain breno died of the fever .	The people elected me as their leader i vowed that no one would be left behind .	and
0	72026	To vibrate as though originating from deep in the earth .	Rise through the bottoms of her feet .	and
2	126431	He still lives over in n.h. .	Has given up writing .	but
1	72927	The entire reason i fell in love with humanity was .	I fell in love with him .	because
4	18364	Indicating the start of the quarter .	The whistle blows , i 'm surprised trevor .	when
0	110685	I pull myself up the steps .	Let him press a cross against my forehead .	and
2	130034	We still spent most of our free time .	It was different , charged with things moving under the surface .	but
0	113859	Though he landed a few lucky punches , the doormen usually got the best of him .	He found himself on his ass in the parking lot bleeding and bruised .	and
0	86692	I kissed him back with everything i had moved in and around him as love ensnared us .	Devoured him with every tool in my arsenal .	and
2	78253	He did not fully understand what he felt .	He realized that he was sad .	but
0	158544	The rabbit was once more in sight ; i told her i would do the deed , if she would just be gone .	I was quite insane .	and
2	70325	It 'll seem like forever . '' .	I 'll wait for you .	but
2	101088	This place had been ours for the weekend , and .	It was cozy and quiet and romantic .	but
3	52002	What she 'd say .	She ever found out i was in this type of establishment .	if
2	84747	He 'd given her his blood .	He 'd never taken hers .	but
2	151397	Not only have you forgiven me . '' .	You 're pretty mellow .	but
0	67461	The ground crewmen were bundling up their supplies .	The house servants were busily engaged in packing all laurence 's things under temeraire 's watchful eye , including the scarlet robes of silk and velvet .	and
3	51226	Then they needed to think .	These things masquerading as religious representatives thought they might have the advantage in this situation .	if
3	7738	The ransom money will also be returned .	You let me take the steps i think necessary .	if
4	15908	Once , centuries ago causing leaks that made me worry we all might die , i had felt the tingle of greatness , the zest of being alive that human achievements often brought to mere bystanders like me .	The room was in flux with power that vibrated the air and created small cracks in the feeds to the portal .	when
2	8714	I 'll try not to do it .	It 's difficult to shut out your thoughts and feelings .	but
2	102597	It gave the illusion of flying high in the sky .	That was just one possible window out of this existence .	but
3	104597	He did not get it , so he continued , `` all the other varieties yielded perfectly constant and similar offspring ; at any rate , no essential difference was observed during two trial years . '' .	He had expected sympathy at this result .	if
3	29814	She 'd awaken him for sure .	She tried to break loose .	if
0	81456	He let the transformation quicken .	Once he was a full wolf , turned towards the forest and ran at full speed .	and
2	95249	He wields the power to heal or kill with a touch .	Craves only privacyan impossible dream for the man who was used as galahads physical template .	but
0	68389	Trembling , i ripped off the hood .	Blinked as the bright light in the room stung my eyes .	and
0	95100	The trees lining the meadow had put on their brightest colors .	Circled the green in blazing gold , red , copper , and russet orange .	and
0	158406	There were a few slow imbibers who put up a bit of a fight .	One who had stuck with a bottle of looted sherry put up a spirited last-drop stand until golem constable dorfl picked him up bodily and bounced him on his head .	and
0	40286	Her long hair glistened in the sunlight .	She had a youthful strong body .	and
0	82588	She was going home .	Some guy offered to walk her back .	and
2	10334	She could see anger , pain , and a whole lot of energy he ran forward , leaving his horse to graze in the grass .	Then slowed as he took kiethara in .	but
2	46500	She thought she heard a trace of sarcasm in his voice .	Her confusion was deepening because he 'd started trailing one finger down the side of her face and over her lips , which she instinctively parted .	but
3	141936	I 'm not sure .	He means it the way that i take it .	if
0	111139	This is raymond carr .	This is the local news .	and
4	95563	I felt a joy i had never felt before .	He grabbed my hand .	when
0	159390	Staying here , instead of crawling out on a narrow ledge and falling to my death .	Taking a bath with elaine .	and
1	27760	Even i know you will never love me .	I have always loved you .	because
1	114117	I canceled the rest of my trip to the other parts of europe i was backpacking through .	I wanted to be there where he asked me to wait .	because
2	102725	It was having to change the habits of millennia .	It was finding ways in , even if they were no bigger than keyholes .	but
0	87281	To kimberly nodding his head .	Making eye contact with her to signal the transition .	and
2	48648	After the mayor and the others listened patiently to the ladies , they just told them it was a matter for sheriff mitch , and .	They couldnt do anything about it .	but
1	24318	Who actually pulled the gentleman card and told us to get our lily-white asses out of there .	It was getting dark .	because
2	99923	I have told the source every bit of the story up until his waking , including every action the knife took and did not take .	Instead of disappointment , the source is proud .	but
2	34703	His heart had staked its claim .	His mind understood that a future with echo was impossible .	but
0	86866	He had left oy out of his calculations .	Was now paying the price .	and
0	13626	Nick pulled out his nokia 9000 .	Flipped it open to see he had a new e-mail .	and
4	134587	Even if they are small , it takes me right back to that moment when i first saw the video of me on that pool table being ... f**ked like i .	I am the last to know things .	when
4	33646	Luce had been waiting for him .	Her dad 's chrysler new yorker had rolled through sword and cross 's tall wrought iron gates just before noon .	when
2	107190	I had time to shower and change and after less than four hours of sleep , one cup didnt exactly do magic .	Get one cup of coffee in me .	but
4	20644	These were the times-more were still alive .	Bills came due or we had to shovel out the car-that i wished my dad .	when
0	35198	The sun warmed her sharp features .	Turned them into a soft glow .	and
4	11427	Her face was covered in frown lines .	He looked over at her .	when
2	96483	Lifting her up to a standing position .	She crippled over to her right side in agonizing pain .	but
2	97223	Her knees give way .	He holds her upright .	but
0	159121	To stick a tack in it for .	Move on to my next problem .	and
0	28718	But as for morwen , she was of the thrall-folk .	Has fled as thralls will .	and
3	124367	It would be embarrassing .	You spent all that money only to find out you 'd built your monuments in the wrong era .	if
0	139874	Alex picked up the warm metal .	Gently brought it up to her dry and cracked lips .	and
3	7730	Harper , all those years ago we 'd probably be happily married ourselves and those girls would never have had to suffer . '' .	You had only obeyed me .	if
2	51120	She did not want to argue .	This lack of faith could not be borne .	but
4	138315	It was near midnight .	The drone known as number ten entered the dungeon , with one of the sheep in tow .	when
4	89410	You were there . '' .	I took out nelson .	when
2	75753	Arianna felt like laughing .	Thought it inappropriate given the circumstances .	but
2	8596	Leons self-absorption was wearing thin .	One thing donna still liked was the apartment which offered the background to the portrait of virgies intense and excited face .	but
0	40919	Anger ripped through me , the sounds burning my throat .	I let it out .	and
3	57228	The men would follow travis .	He himself gave in .	if
2	16360	I thought we might put them in the living room . '' .	If you want them in your private bedroom , that would fine .	but
0	58829	The girl came out of there going full tilt got hit by a car .	Ran out into the street .	and
0	44778	The woman walked around today .	I saw him talk to her .	and
0	120270	The door was of plain , heavy wood bound in iron .	Appeared to be in good repair .	and
0	76239	This finders gold mine .	He might never find another one .	and
4	63826	He felt like a boy in puberty .	He noticed the opposite sex .	when
0	73733	They heard yelling and automobile horns outside .	Everyone went to the west-facing window .	and
4	32544	Jumping through the air and raising her hands .	She was close enough .	when
3	92529	`` , i would say it was .	I had to guess .	if
3	108759	A guy like orlando might be a local celebrity .	Especially he wore the damned trench coat all of the time .	if
4	80610	Finally , though gina had to tell him .	They broke apart to smile at each other .	when
0	126180	After all the perishables got put away , charity fixed a bottle of formula , the diaper bag , and the sleeping boy into another room .	Passed it off to molly , who took it .	and
0	1368	He was gazing down at me .	He smiled just a little .	and
0	152197	Many friends staying with you .	They were prepared to defend you .	and
4	139609	You always show up .	I 'm just about done with the hard work .	when
2	126634	The trickier part was getting scout and me out of study hall to follow her .	We 'd cross that bridge when we came to it .	but
3	48989	Julian would never let andre forget it .	Camille had her baby .	if
3	124718	When i first asked him .	Kyle drake had ever worked for him .	if
3	67813	Instead of you , do you think he 'd have wanted to help me .	Harrison had been in that parking lot that night .	if
0	152679	Like you you played me .	Broke my heart you acted like we could make it through and instead we just fell apart nothing you said was ever true we were doomed from the start .	and
2	103865	She knew , and .	It had nothing to do with alan pangborn or kelton or the san francisco department of child welfare .	but
2	109086	There were a few squalid looking apartment buildings across the street , white stucco like violetta 's place .	Stained with green sludge .	but
0	149839	They taste like salt .	Watch my father tie the matching armband around his upper arm .	and
3	133051	Selling a million pocket planners this christmas and getting the chance to be with you .	It 's a choice .	if
2	23549	Adam draped a blanket over cassie 's shoulders .	Too , felt chilly and damp on her body .	but
2	133036	She wasnt sure how she had gotten in that position .	She didnt have time to think about it because she felt brandon take a firm hold of her hips .	but
0	38034	Fiona bit her lip .	Then noted , `` prentice seemed - '' `` he 'll be fine .	and
3	128757	`` and then what the hell is she ? '' .	She 's not daft .	if
3	6773	`` , it can be a mutually beneficial partnership .	You work with me .	if
4	148366	My mouth was open in laughter .	He placed his lips against mine , resulting in an awkward first kiss .	when
0	142062	The cell phone chose that moment to ring . '' .	I slipped the earpiece in as i stopped the car `` riley .	and
4	40202	I did a little jig there in the middle of the floor .	I was sure he was gone .	when
2	143583	`` i wish i could stay . '' .	I have a flying toddler at home who will be up at the crack of dawn .	but
0	97424	Then sensation flooded back into them , burning like ice .	They began to spasm .	and
0	71568	There were more nosting vamps than thoy had bargained for .	The whito bloed spilled liko sludgy , sour milk .	and
2	16190	He 'd gotten me into this .	I bore him no anus .	but
2	43803	She had always been attractive .	Now she just exuded a new sense of confidence that made her seem very sexy .	but
2	141320	It was not loud .	About every ten seconds , it went .	but
3	27180	The mind tended to follow .	The brain was healed .	if
3	126277	I hope you pick up the next book in the series , entanglements due to be published in may 2014 .	You enjoyed this story .	if
0	70746	Aw , look , she fell .	Even was so kind to lead us to a dead end alley to give us privacy .	and
2	81997	He moved and between steps and sentences his gray eyes missed nothing .	Talked with great deliberation .	but
2	8650	You call me lolita .	You get weird when i 'm not dressed up , when i look my age .	but
0	67579	Ten minutes later they 'd pushed through the crowds .	Were outside the guilds .	and
3	118353	Then it 's not a terrible thing to cut your losses and go your own way with no hard feelings . '' .	You 're both not getting what you expected out of a marriage .	if
4	60507	No hiding his enthusiasm .	We finally saw the galleon we were looking for .	when
4	91877	A tiny white and tan cat greets me .	I get back from the store .	when
2	70629	They claimed nikola tesla and alexander fleming as their own .	Strangely left marie curie untouched .	but
4	10733	All he could see was her dream .	He scanned the area .	when
0	133990	When we finally reached the gate , shadi stepped to one side .	One of the other tactical wizards , a large guy they called diesel , took the other with their guns at the ready .	and
2	79486	He laughs , because he knows that it is .	I can hear the edge in his voice .	but
2	71813	His condition wasnt improving .	It also wasnt getting worse .	but
1	24752	She had done what she felt she had to do .	She had been released from terror .	because
3	13107	You 'll end up hurting your .	You try to do too much by yourself .	if
0	150162	Coop buries his face in my neck .	Takes in my scent one more time .	and
2	7613	We almost made it out of the house without being stopped .	Hayden wanted to grab a bottle of water for the road .	but
2	147804	The sweat began to roll , and .	Her heart began to pound , her muscles to burn , and she liked it , so she raised the incline and kicked up the speed .	but
2	113027	The night was hot and humid .	The air moved enough out there to be comfortable .	but
0	57908	Sephrenia rode in the lead .	She held flute enfolded in her arms .	and
2	160695	Only i could have him .	What i found out .	but
4	141096	Frankie started walking in the direction , he had last seen carrie .	His feet went out from under him .	when
0	64900	He shook his head .	Sat back from her on the bed .	and
4	111866	I started to think that we were going to make it .	I heard running footsteps and a woman rounded the corner ahead of us .	when
0	113367	Gollum used to wear it at first , till it tired him ; ; and now usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island , and was always going back to look at it .	Then he kept it in a pouch next his skin , till it galled him .	and
2	159879	Blanching , she cringed .	Still looked as though she might say something .	but
2	48350	His body clenched tight , like he 'd just taken a punch .	He continued to stare at her without .	but
0	108266	In the last hour the fog had largely disappeared .	The sun peeped through to dry the foliage .	and
2	96411	He had to keep refusing with his heart in his eyes .	I said , here , milan , a dusty throat is bad for a man , and .	but
0	145742	Some security guys came .	Tried to talk him .	and
4	87622	It abruptly went into a paroxysm of thrashing .	He laid it down on the parade grounds before them .	when
2	97751	She tried to protest .	Then he unhooked her bra and slid his hands over her breasts .	but
0	33816	She snagged her glasses off the dash .	Shoved them onto her face before opening the door to get out .	and
2	157266	I knelt beside him , he was breathing .	His eyes were closed .	but
1	159048	The new owners and their neighbors must have been at work .	No one came out to check on her .	because
0	71593	Teth waved him to the side .	Ducked into the trees herself .	and
2	9196	`` no party , '' zev said , `` just holding my woman and you 're all welcome . '' .	Doing a little dancing .	but
0	56812	He grabbed a can of soda after a long drink and plopped down on the couch .	Took it with him into the living room .	and
4	109976	The others consulted their notes .	Bev finished her summary .	when
2	116758	I tried to follow .	My lungs were burning , finally slowing down because of the pain .	but
0	118246	It 's getting old , ' i snapped leaving the room .	Turning on my heel .	and
2	124612	Pa had been commissioned by the town to build them .	He had done the work for free in exchange for an education for his boy .	but
4	121107	The office door was ajar , and jason was already seated at his desk with his door open .	She arrived on their floor .	when
2	11835	The fact that i was talking to some guy in an imagined house , in an imagined forest , kept hitting me , and .	There was no way i was dreaming .	but
2	26174	'' he says softly , and if anything , he sounds relieved .	His response knocks me off balance because i am expecting his anger .	but
2	2224	She preferred black coffee .	Starbucks brew always tasted burnt to her .	but
2	143534	`` listen , i 'm in morehead city , and . '' .	You 're not going to believe who i just saw .	but
2	130587	It had been on hers .	She 'd hoped to force answers out of the now dead vamp .	but
0	74822	She hunched into the light wind .	Started the long walk home .	and
2	28878	He thought he heard his name faintly borne on the breeze as he pushed on up the street .	He wasnt going to make the mistake of turning round and catching anybodys eye .	but
2	55232	We are above the ground , grimdin noted as he saw the castle garden on his left .	He couldnt make out anything else familiar , not even the desert .	but
0	61680	His eyes rolled back in his head .	He passed out at her feet .	and
0	41247	Magnus laughed under his breath .	Tasted metal in his mouth .	and
2	7235	I could , to talk some more .	Ill be returning late at night .	but
2	111590	I mean , sometimes i walk to the mailbox without sunscreen . '' .	Most of the time i try to put it on .	but
4	18761	It was fresh in my mind .	I went into his office .	when
4	102019	And ; we couldnt let it come to pass .	We found out what horrific thing they were planning .	when
4	140803	To help with the dinner preparations .	She felt , rather than heard .	when
0	142622	I shook my head in disappointment .	Then i put the box into the fridge .	and
0	60411	His fur 's all matted . '' .	It 's uncomfortable for him .	and
0	154751	Suzi is standing upside-down and you are directly below her .	Roped in the shuttles hold .	and
0	114649	The man went after him , running to be precise .	He stopped whirling himself on the ground that instant and straightened up to confront him .	and
2	109326	The window display was too crowded to be called elegant .	Judging by the price tags the owner had a feel for quality .	but
2	123803	You all heard them .	I was the only one in whom he confided .	but
2	20511	Another ledge surrounded the tower , giving access to all the other bridges leading off to sections of the castle .	They were going inside the tower .	but
1	84602	It has been good for my reputation .	The book won the guggenheim decennial prize for cartography .	because
2	40364	He was prowling across the stage like a caged lion , growling a metal number .	His eyes never left her .	but
0	18671	He pulled the collar close to his chin .	Realized the cold deserved a thicker coat .	and
2	111652	There were grumbles from the clown 's gang and followers .	Twisto only laughed mockingly before asking , oh .	but
2	42682	She caught herself on the palms of her hands .	They skidded damply over the concrete , and she had to fight not to do a face-plant .	but
2	117779	He admired her grit .	She was really pushing every button he had .	but
4	81337	She was working as a veterinarian 's assistant .	She met and married tony cad , a flashy duck with a pocket full of credit cards and a lot of fancy talk about index funds and privatizing ancient egypt .	when
2	85678	This time she caught her breath a little .	She did not flinch .	but
2	86281	I tried to warn her by clenching her thigh to stop .	Knew she 'd continue until she got her answers .	but
1	63482	Why you killed robert .	He was norwich 's son and '' `` i killed him for money .	because
0	68980	His pace crossing the dust was .	His eyes were quick .	and
4	9513	On wednesday i checked my email and i had a message from the dean .	I went back to my room after my last class .	when
2	89829	Usually big political events are full of men in suits .	The boov were joined now by totally ordinary-looking people .	but
1	13530	I must have looked worried .	He turned to me with a look of concern .	because
0	140500	Who was interrupting his meal .	Saw the most threatening guy he had ever seen before , he just felt an uncontrollable need to run away from him as far and as quickly as possible .	and
1	7565	Make sure you make the right decision .	Making the wrong decision could cost you everything .	because
0	42577	Somehow he pumps fear into me .	I feel it soaking into my skin from his .	and
2	60924	Even with the dog weighing heavy in his arms and his concern that it might be seriously hurt , he couldnt help notice the sway of her trim hips .	She led him to a small examination room and .	but
2	147676	He was watching her .	He couldnt say anything around the gag , and if shane wasnt struggling , maybe there wasnt anything to be gained from it .	but
2	40744	She looked at him .	Felt exposed in her next-to-nothing lingerie .	but
3	136070	`` , ye know what we 'll be in need of doing . '' .	She is found with them .	if
2	16580	The noodles slowly spin up onto my fork .	I 'm still waiting for his reaction before i try any .	but
4	140755	The counts chauffeur was killed by a stray bullet .	He was unlucky enough to have driven one of von brechstlers cars into a street where a street-battle , so common after the war , was being waged between two opposing factions of strassenkmpfer .	when
0	154948	The bell rang , signaling the end of the lunch period .	The two of us went our separate ways .	and
1	128508	It had something to do with her backside .	They 'd been paying special attention to that .	because
0	74193	Reyes was in the states , new york city to be exact .	Aeron 's signal was beeping from his phone as if the warrior were flying overhead .	and
3	102893	He 's a fearful boy , an irrational shut-in .	I 'm to be perfectly frank with you .	if
2	44948	He looked him over .	He did not remember him .	but
4	23374	But , i was notoriously unlucky .	It came to the smaller things in life .	when
0	26095	You could go to college if you wanted to .	Get a real job .	and
0	50954	The police officers ran up behind them , siren blaring noisily as it skidded to a stop .	A police car made its way from around the corner .	and
2	35277	I shake my head , willing him to stop talking .	He does n't . .	but
2	63376	Jake was unable to remember any other places .	Instead said : `` conjournicolly ! '' .	but
2	8891	Unable to determine which body part hurt more , he continued wailing .	Kept switching between straddling his arm and clutching his balls .	but
3	114577	He might be able to keep ahead of the pack , at least long enough to pick them off with the palmlazr .	It had enough power .	if
2	89839	The head assassin said later that he had looked into the eyes of many men who , obviously , were very near death .	He had never looked into eyes that were so clearly and unmistakably looking back at him from the slopes of hell .	but
0	98026	Only looking up at the sky .	Thinking how good i felt and going to sleep .	and
1	128113	So whatever you 're doing , keep it up . '' .	I totally want to be you when i grow up .	because
2	155826	My small petite frame and lack of muscle didnt necessarily send men running for their lives .	That never stopped me from giving them the opportunity .	but
0	29367	When he finished squanto gave a long sigh .	Said , i hope those tribes do not fight the white man as we tried to do in open land .	and
0	141585	Hermes slipped his arm into hers .	As he led her from the throne room , he glanced over his shoulder to give me one more smile .	and
4	89521	The cordozas killed her .	She managed to escape .	when
4	3248	I will serve you .	I have finished all this paperwork .	when
4	19829	I want to be .	You talk to this person .	when
4	53452	He could smell it-smell it on her breath .	She came back to his mouth .	when
4	11032	To throw around ideas-and .	I say `` meeting .	when
2	154249	Michele was irresponsible and flighty and she wasnt stupid .	Drawn to bad men .	but
3	79289	`` forgive me , '' the barman apologized , `` but you seem to have the speech of a salt water man . '' .	I seem to pry .	if
2	143945	`` thank you for the kind offer of your companion 's company , '' he said hastily , `` . '' .	I must respectfully decline .	but
4	140028	I did the same thing .	My friends and miss princess manapalata were kidnapped .	when
0	157646	Whose occupants had already recognized defeat .	Were trying to flee .	and
0	155372	To keep me happy .	Stop me thinking about the macgrigor .	and
3	152093	At least , he reasoned i 'll see him .	Whelk is here and using a flashlight .	if
3	91604	In fact , she would 've been shocked .	He 'd decided to show up .	if
0	24864	Seconds later jack was .	Handing sam his pack , he turned and pulled the door down behind them .	and
0	8636	Him walk from the hall with dignity .	I felt a deep sense of gratitude to my father .	and
0	137993	Do it again . '' .	I will hurt you .	and
1	49368	She 'd be needing that independent streak of hers once more .	Especially once he was gone .	because
0	82521	Second of all , theres no way you and me can load my bike into your truck by ourselves , and .	I doubt stephanie is going to help .	and
3	110408	He is what he is .	He was born one , like you .	if
4	3300	He said , `` get nurian .	Marian suddenly appeared in the parlor doorway .	when
3	43183	It could go badly . '' .	She feels you 're disrespecting lucas .	if
2	49711	They had not been invited merely for the easter holidays .	Rather to attend a wedding-cyril bancroft 's wedding to charlotte , who had been his secretary for two decades .	but
2	6262	She loved her father , she thought about him every day .	She hadnt seen him in a long time .	but
2	83584	I do have the assassins and the thieves in agreement on this .	To cover all eventualities .	but
4	16670	She saw toni tied up and gagged , lying on the bed .	She turned on the light .	when
2	21940	Hes called it the gray before .	I dont know what that means .	but
2	11460	Where they had gone or why .	When they reappeared , it would be time to leave .	but
3	104661	He will undoubtedly return to the manor when the excursion is complete .	He is conscious of the reason he was recruited .	if
1	2483	He seemed to hate me in particular .	I was at a school for paranormals without showing any paranormal abilities .	because
0	108800	That tasted of tears .	Said , `` easy .	and
0	70482	He spun away as if to start to the door .	She reached out and grabbed his arm .	and
0	67678	Fergus wants this mating done . '' .	He wants to make sure dad relinquishes power tomorrow .	and
2	95290	I dont mean to push .	When do you plan to check in on her .	but
4	154076	Shelby 's face had turned as red as a traffic light .	He 'd stretched out across the ridiculous bedspread that had nearly maimed him .	when
4	13397	To meet his thrust .	He yanked my hips up .	when
2	62218	* * * for me there was no such thing as a quick getaway .	We made our way down the stairs , augustus holding my cart , and then started to walk back toward the filosoof on a bumpy sidewalk of interwoven rectangular bricks .	but
2	121839	The cut was just below the hairline on her temple .	She still didnt want a noticeable scar .	but
2	35223	His hair had thinned out a little bit and it was still colored like gold and honey and his eyes were that sharp , calculating blue .	Had lost a bit of the sheen .	but
2	63506	Janet picked up her phone .	Before dialing , she played her messages .	but
4	143270	She bellows another blast of fire at me , but again , i do not burn .	I raise my head .	when
0	55271	I looked past two of them .	Saw three more shifting in .	and
0	115462	Aubrey jumped up on the table 's flat surface , half of her sprawling on the page .	Lay down to watch me .	and
0	32974	Now they had tied their poor victim to a great post near the center of the village , directly before mbonga 's hut .	Here they formed a dancing , yelling circle of warriors about her , alive with flashing knives and menacing spears .	and
2	97980	She nodded her agreement .	Cautioned , `` take care of my girl .	but
3	61696	I would become nameless and i would have no direction to aid you .	The teachers betrayed me .	if
0	535	We were so close that my eyelashes brushed his chin .	I could feel the warmth of body heat in the small space between our mouths .	and
2	94365	I 'm instantly grumpy that my insane job has once again cost me a nice evening romp on the couch .	Then i feel warm lips running over my abs and .	but
2	17331	I probably should have just given him the lantern instead of following him .	By the time i 'd had that thought , he was already in the tent .	but
2	59765	`` and i 'm sorry . '' .	There seems to be a lot of treachery among your kind .	but
2	123916	She knew it was clich .	She felt exactly like cinderella at the ball .	but
4	106242	We all went running into the bedroom and found her standing over the body .	She found jessie and screamed .	when
3	18224	Then maybe he isnt good enough for you .	Then he doesnt like the change in you .	if
2	26316	I nodded in her direction .	Quickly got distracted by the tableau being acted out in the opposite corner of the room .	but
2	153703	Graduated couldnt leave the mountains behind .	They come from the same university , set up a mountaineering group and .	but
2	170	My dad felt more pressure to make money fixing up the house .	Also to work more hours , so he could help her out .	but
2	108	The past years of habitual checking had produced nothing .	It was part of my routine .	but
4	47515	I shall have to check her for fever .	We 're back in the car .	when
2	74879	In many parts of rhol the orler tree was thought to be extinct .	The lealians had nurtured several over the centuries and hidden them throughout the forests of rhol .	but
2	83712	They 'd been onto each other almost from the first .	For them the game was their version of flirting and dating .	but
2	91581	Behind him , arizona stirred .	She did not open her eyes .	but
3	129386	The insecurity he 'd opened up to me about in his apartment-what could be scarier than hearing student after student perform .	You doubted your own ability .	if
2	49312	There are men of fortune willing to seek a pedigree , and . '' .	I do at least have that .	but
2	90807	Lawson had strongly suggested he shove it all the way up his ass .	He envisioned one of maso 's goons forcing him to sit for whatever reason and decided it was the cheeks or nothing at all .	but
3	111393	She could have done it long before now . '' .	She 'd wanted to steal my notes .	if
3	151730	We 'd appreciate it . '' .	You 'd come and collect the messages as soon as possible .	if
2	87524	He slid his tongue into my mouth .	I smacked his shoulder on principle .	but
3	146543	Why then did guilt weigh so heavy on him .	He was truly convinced of this .	if
2	9671	Shed never had to comfort patty before .	She looked so small and tired , she couldnt help but pity her .	but
3	25438	As soon as she 'd released him from her mouth , he wrapped his hand around hers and pulled on his dick so hard and fast , she wondered .	It hurt , especially when the look on his face seemed pained .	if
4	56233	What he always says .	The borderlands are mentioned .	when
1	31363	As for why he 'll talk to you tonight , he 'll talk to you . '' .	You 're going to take along a bottle of whisky when you come this time .	because
4	113334	They just looked like babies .	You 'd hit fifty-five .	when
2	137087	Anya knew that she had to act .	Did not know how else to buy more time .	but
2	126403	He looked at her as if he didnt want to let her through .	He conceded and waved her through , saying , come on .	but
0	90681	Asking a multitude of questions .	Filling in several forms .	and
4	71027	Eyes wide open in amazement .	He looked over the villagers who were standing .	when
2	38738	His voice had the ring of authority , and .	Elena saw the bouncers close the exit door .	but
0	7760	Strange letters were carved across the surface of all three spheres , like some crystal computer .	Spun to form all manner of combinations .	and
2	107182	He was good looking like jimmy .	Being five years older , exuded more confidence .	but
0	108536	Back in a sec , '' he said .	In a flash , he was gone .	and
2	94543	She could feel his eyes drilling into her and was desperately trying to think of an excuse to get out of the party .	She did like his family and she 'd enjoy a party at the famous anderson mansion she 'd heard so much about .	but
0	118701	He set his feet forward , rolling .	Gave a mighty upward heave .	and
2	54490	What they had done .	That had been without knowledge .	but
3	67300	She 'd need it .	This day kept getting harder to bear .	if
2	21216	He 'd wanted to go another round .	He could tell that valerie 's stress level was through the roof .	but
0	138170	Kyrian turned it on .	Handed it to him .	and
1	158594	No , we 're .	That coats man is a total nutjob .	because
2	95967	Kouji stood , making his way for the exit .	Was dragged back by his own long hair .	but
0	17982	Something or the television noise scared them .	Then they popped out .	and
2	12434	Brian 's might have been white .	Its color was lost beneath a thick layer of mud .	but
4	61315	She started , nervous to ask him but wanting so badly to know the answer .	We were at the fallen realm .	when
0	107821	As they looked on , the jet ranger slowed .	Made a wide turn around the ship .	and
3	92635	Only cover up to my waist .	It makes you feel more comfortable .	if
2	150815	I was supposed to take them . '' .	I 'm running late for a meeting .	but
0	159845	Grant only had to give slight compulsion .	We had keys to our suite .	and
2	93099	I enjoyed the walk on the beach .	I should have known that everything comes with a price .	but
4	105439	She casts a worried glance at bev .	She walks back to thomas .	when
2	148900	The air is humid in my lungs .	The cover of shade helps to tame the heat .	but
3	47603	`` or i swear , i 'll kill you myself . '' .	I ever get out of this .	if
0	21347	His frustration would soon get the better of him .	Some bandit would have to pay the price for that .	and
0	59403	I barely know jack . '' .	When i think i do know him , everyone warns me off-everyone including jack .	and
2	915	Chapter twenty-two i 'm discussing max with the moon .	It 's supremely unsatisfying .	but
4	94392	Who tended to be over dramatic .	She expressed her emotions .	when
2	77258	The leaves fell on him , but bounced off him to the sheet of sparkling white at his feet .	He didnt bother noticing that they didnt melt through him , as they had through his palms .	but
1	81681	The stories say nothing more about him .	There was nothing more to say .	because
1	96238	It served both the baby and i better .	I could be right next to her .	because
0	89543	Sparhawk turned in his saddle .	Laid a finger across his lips .	and
2	3798	I have no idea what kind of paper it is .	It looks like it fits .	but
3	73482	Then a part of him will be glad it wasnt any worse .	It only costs us a day .	if
2	125829	Julsey was interested in some sketches and plans he had for marine plantlife projects she came across .	He was more into fisheries and the zoology aspects of marine life , and most of his focus would remain that way .	but
4	5904	He rapped and danced hip hop at the skate park .	The weather turned too warm to snow board .	when
0	86613	I pulled my hoodie around me , sitting sideways on the bench .	Drew my legs up to my chest .	and
0	99634	All he needed was the signal from his pet .	He 'd have the gray bitch .	and
2	36123	I froze , still very sensitive ! '' .	Managed to demand , `` quit ordering me around .	but
2	30162	He might have been a loner in all other aspects of his life .	When it came to his team , they were a solid , unbreakable unit .	but
0	63029	He could out of her , he stood up .	Looked down at her .	and
2	94465	So far this place looks like the real deal .	Ive only just now gotten their site up .	but
0	71839	Eric leaned forward , blocking the view of her from everyone else in the club .	Rested his arms on the table .	and
3	60004	I hated myself for saying those things .	Even they were true .	if
2	83753	He turned to go back into the building .	She caught his arm .	but
0	118692	She closed her eyes .	Desperately tried to wake herself up .	and
3	77323	`` , '' she said , `` they 're going to summon an ambulance . '' .	People see a man shot .	if
2	58245	The sound was mild , at .	She did it again and again the cough became deeper , rougher .	but
0	99816	`` take your hands off me , '' i demanded .	Tried to pull away from him .	and
0	100594	Chronicles of princess chelle the sceadu dance the celebration went on around us , or the dragon .	I wondered who i would find tonight to celebrate the lioness .	and
0	36577	Somebody had poured lead into my head while i was sleeping .	Now it rolled around in my skull , creating a racket .	and
3	7545	Them commit me by .	Theyd have told me that would end it .	if
3	15182	`` , no god above being angry at me-i have to live with knowing that with a little more eff ort-a little more practice or skill-i could have saved them . '' .	There 's no curse or bad luck .	if
2	69123	I read between the lines and .	Was happy for her .	but
0	148659	I will just take the roof off a building , and people will tell me anyway . '' .	Then i can look inside and lift them out , if they are in .	and
0	103931	If you really wanted them to see santa , you could shape-shift . '' .	Put us all to shame .	and
0	159532	He would fire his two bullets , break himmlers neck .	Then that would be it .	and
0	141042	But columba was now at iona .	From there , was sending missionaries .	and
4	31777	Sit in the invisible chair .	You start to feel out of control .	when
2	18940	There was a big stink , one of his workers quit and went to the authorities .	Your dad pulled out some shit about wood chippers being an accepted way of euthanasia for turkeys .	but
0	8939	Derrick and i wait for henderson to finish .	Then we decide to go for a walkabout .	and
0	2579	I want to sleep , '' she said .	She curled up against his side and closed her eyes .	and
2	147628	It would have taken mother five minutes to walk .	She would never willingly arrive anywhere flushed with exertion .	but
0	121566	The body should have moved forward by a microsecond .	Left the head where it was .	and
0	127690	I hunched forward a little more , digging my hands into his overly bright feathers .	Braced myself against the wind and the uneven way he soared through the sky .	and
4	140439	Max came out of his office .	He heard her enter , a slight frown marring his classic brow .	when
2	65610	Youre a wonderful man , she said by way of greeting .	You can be truly disgusting .	but
0	70447	The captain of the watch shrugged ... ... ... where the patrician was having a difficult lunch-time .	Carried on through the throng to the patrician 's palace .	and
4	33013	In the lake jeff and todd finley were almost to shore .	They saw the large crack form between where the marina had stood and the shoreline .	when
2	111297	I know youve given this a lot of thought , said harman-karman .	You know that it cant be done , right .	but
4	85757	The only allergies you have to flowers is .	You receive them in a romantic gesture .	when
3	60638	There were probably hundreds of pieces to go .	The pattern was any indication .	if
0	154993	He is very companionable .	I never heard him complain .	and
3	104900	She shuddered as he drove into her , going as deep as he could with a single , powerful thrust .	As any distance at all between them was far too much .	if
3	44363	We should look into getting a pi license .	We are serious about making this our living .	if
2	2816	They had covered many miles .	This had been somewhat less wearing than the relentless work , bent double in the sodden fields .	but
0	122953	He wanted a trophy wife .	Thats what he got .	and
4	84949	That evening , eloisa was uncharacteristically quiet .	Fernie came to the longoria house for dinner .	when
2	154036	Dana wanted to hightail it to north carolina to speak with jordan .	They needed to figure out a way to get there without being exposed .	but
2	156756	I should have dug my heels in , same as you .	In an odd sort of way , i feel a sense of loyalty to the department and old folklore .	but
0	49882	My usefulness fades each morning at sunrise . '' .	Does not recommence until dusk .	and
2	145032	I will protect you as long as i can . '' .	That time is limited and i will soon be outnumbered .	but
2	131456	`` i 'll probably be working late tomorrow . '' .	I 'd like to have dinner with you afterward if you 're available .	but
2	43494	Monika glared at pacabens smug smile .	She simply declared , time passes , and sometimes the heart grows weary .	but
2	31296	I looked back at dorian and my legs gave way beneath me .	Tried to stand up .	but
2	10607	Admittedly , he did cut corners and most of the stuff he handled was a bit iffy .	The risks were low , unlike this little outing .	but
0	12557	Three caravan wagons smoldered .	The signs of a battle littered the ground .	and
4	71029	They had all shown up at the airport with me .	I 'd gotten the call .	when
0	52479	When she reached out to touch it , the wolf growled .	Pushed himself between her and the plant .	and
0	49136	She opened her tote .	Took out the picture .	and
3	80414	I will get her out of this before the shit hits the fan .	I can find a way .	if
0	91100	For a timo there was unrost and talk of criminal trials to idontify undor the shado of the holocaust .	Punish those guilty of human rights abusos .	and
0	150239	I need to lay the scene and into the next in as seamless a transition as sea to sky on a cloudless summer day .	Hopefully , pull myself out of this world .	and
2	64929	The waitress reached for the bottle .	It was too late .	but
3	153304	It will fall like many towns and cities in arlin .	We do not band .	if
1	108245	You wouldnt be able to tell .	Her mothers eyes were rimmed red from crying sidney .	because
1	145531	Anyway , chad and deb had to leave earlier and ... '' marion must have picked up on the fact that sera felt uncomfortable with the present situation .	She extended her hand to introduce herself and said , `` hello jeff , i 'm marion sinclair .	because
0	150692	The body temperature indicates he was dead by seven at the latest .	The stomach contents tend to bear that out .	and
4	65317	She leaped to throw herself across the windshield and hood of tomikas car as it was idling at the curb in front of morgans house .	She got to the front pavement .	when
3	101183	So you give him a few hundred dollars to torch some trees that he would have cleared .	The woodpecker nests hadnt been found .	if
3	10381	You know that complaints like these are background noise , like traffic on the street .	You 're a cop .	if
4	71318	I no longer trusted my instincts .	It came to men .	when
0	139620	Jared glanced over its shoulder .	Saw the creatures brown and yellow , crooked teeth jutting from it mouth .	and
0	49642	Breathing raggedly , i propped myself against the bank of the acheron .	Crossed my legs in front of me .	and
3	145851	Then the story would be about the shooter .	He gave up a shooter .	if
2	10750	You can use brain scans to show differing brain activity .	What the scans actually mean is still subjective .	but
0	88938	Once they are defeated , we will fight him back into his home land .	Tear away his hold on the world .	and
0	136412	I killed a demon had to deal with you. .	Got my body ripped open .	and
2	46794	It was not he expected .	Perhaps the austerity of the space gave more away about the nature of its owner than anything .	but
0	75201	The damn thing will disrupt signals are all controlled by low-voltage electricity .	Can even hurt humans since the brains , lungs , and heart .	and
0	127492	They were just giving me recycled material , i got the impression that it was less a dream and more like the oneroi flipping me onto a tv channel to make sure i stayed distracted and gave them something to feed off of .	Whenever i did see my friends in the world .	and
0	129889	Torak had turned his head .	His eyes were open .	and
3	79446	But , it would make it that much easier for me to do .	He 'd moved on .	if
0	149824	They still had lois 's earrings to worry about .	Doing whatever else it was they had been sent here to do , of course .	and
4	105457	He had crossed into everlost .	He had fallen from a tree while trying to peek inside the window of a girl who would have nothing to do with him .	when
2	111330	I 'd tell him .	I just wanted to get the most of every minute i had with glen and my family .	but
4	39600	It was already infected with late stage king 's curse .	You and avalon took their magic .	when
0	68692	Archer made the mistake of placing a hand on my shoulder .	Suddenly , it was like i was watching myself from outside my body .	and
0	26602	The passageway was deserted .	There were cobwebs and dust .	and
2	43077	Figured i was winning because i ought to be dead , all things considered .	Still , it would have been nice to put a name to some of the parts that hurt .	but
0	2268	She wiped her eyes .	Pointed at his remote .	and
4	99460	He lowered the neck of his guitar towards her face .	She moved a little closer .	when
2	153523	He stopped , staring down at bowles .	Was urged on by the other 's gesture .	but
2	43190	We 'll have to rebuild what 's been destroyed and because there are rooms in the main section , too , we can still open on time . '' .	We 'll lose a good number of bookings as a result .	but
0	5895	They were boxed in at every turn , all trying to dig their way up to the surface .	Had an unknown number of the creatures buried beneath them .	and
4	71619	How could she freak out .	Her best friend was sitting across from her eating chocolate ice cream and grinning .	when
1	31889	Outsiders would try to talk you into counseling .	To them , youre too parentally enmeshedyou love your kids way more than you should .	because
4	9935	Most often these came .	I 'd discovered the death was a suicide .	when
4	71796	He bites his lower lip .	He 's working a particularly difficult knot .	when
1	84056	Well , first because of the note in elena 's diary .	The new stefan was supposed to be so strong , and second .	because
2	76615	Yes , his face was still filthy , and covered with stubble she could see the basics for attractiveness were .	Streaked with camo paint .	but
2	61199	It was more than that , and .	I damn well knew it .	but
2	48362	Im not sure , i mean id like to .	Your grandfather likes to keep me around .	but
3	67011	He battles other kingdoms .	His own people rebel ... '' .	if
0	86966	He dressed with care .	Even added some face paint to subtly enhance his eyes and make his lips more sensual .	and
0	139124	He popped the lid off his coffee cup .	Dumped two packets of sugar substitute into it .	and
0	77815	Justin portakalian came down in his panther form and rolled him playfully across the floor .	Picked up one of the smaller cubs by the scruff of his neck .	and
4	131723	Six hours later , david was in the waiting room .	Dr. patterson approached him .	when
0	132790	Moira had come to recognize some time before that nicolette seemed to prefer to remain undisturbed unless absolutely necessary .	She continued quietly with her tasklaundering the infants garments , believing that her mistress was perhaps retiring for a midday rest .	and
2	23370	Most of the information went over hannah 's head .	She found the aircraft carrier easy to distinguish from the others .	but
0	136228	It poured on his wound .	He will heal as i do .	and
0	95300	He leaned the stick up against the wall .	Glanced out the window again , frowning .	and
0	76499	Reaching nearly twice the height of a man .	Made of seamless , dark grey stone .	and
0	81108	Jacob entered from a room opposite .	Came to stand behind kats head .	and
3	78549	He might manage to recollect her face .	He gawked at her much longer .	if
2	154141	If he ran i would have killed him '' `` of course .	Greed is rarely logical .	but
4	103364	Eight troy was still in the parking lot outside city hall .	Mayor benson came charging toward him .	when
4	14807	It caught the wind and glided toward me .	She unpinned it from her jersey at the finish line .	when
2	132010	It seemed like a good idea at the time .	Then all of a sudden i had my arms around him and my head on his chest .	but
0	132919	`` i hope not , '' she replies .	Picks up the girl .	and
4	84317	She 'd dropped her pistol in favor of the m-4 .	She 'd boarded the chopper .	when
4	63827	He 'd instinctively thought of al mualim as ' the master ' .	He was no longer altair 's master .	when
4	106629	It was the realisation i wouldnt be mounting plaques on my walls ; heads maybe , but not plaques .	I joined the rip .	when
1	158014	First , i felt actual pity for celebrities .	They had to stand for that long and smile .	because
1	118354	It must be powerful magick .	There were few who could match him .	because
3	124893	To be in for it .	We didnt get away from these crazy pale tourists .	if
0	13046	Storm stepped around behind her .	Squatted down , gently checking her leg .	and
0	62488	He called in a voice like thunder .	His staff blazed forth with a flash like the lightning .	and
0	61103	Both hands shoved behind him overheard him , the claws that had ejected out from his fingers stabbed and fixed into the sturdy wood of the ceiling itself .	Established and stayed on the wooden ceiling .	and
2	159031	Charged for the exit .	He grabbed my arm delicately , halting me and pulling me to the side of the door .	but
2	23928	My parents were covering my tuition with the help of an academic scholarship .	There had never been many luxuries .	but
0	83208	Then she closed her eyes .	Flashed herself to olympus to speak with said goddess .	and
2	70593	I drank the coffee too fast to enjoy it .	It kept me from giving anything away , or i hoped it did .	but
0	16238	Ill do what they want me to do , than live my own life .	Comply with my obligation .	and
2	50605	She 'd only caught a glimpse of all of it .	Already knew she wanted desperately to run her tongue along those hip dips .	but
3	51050	She would have been vastly interested .	I 'd told her .	if
2	57497	Soft murmurs of assent rose from the crowd .	He ignored them , watching me .	but
0	109215	He took a seat behind his desk .	Gestured for the two of them to take a seat .	and
2	24003	His eyes remained closed .	He could hear and sense his surroundings .	but
4	139249	She swatted at him .	He slowed down and started to pick her up .	when
0	45916	But soon they began to fall down into the darkness .	The sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their faces .	and
4	145650	I was barely thirteen .	I signed on as a deckhand to the first ship that would take me .	when
4	8445	He gently grasped my arm .	I turned to walk .	when
2	65818	Yeah , norian was .	My adrenalin had been pumping and i took them all out before i even realized we might need one of them .	but
2	26432	There are chairs with average cushions for some comfort .	Theres nowhere that will suck you in and force you to stay there for a week and a half eating anything that doesnt need cooking and can be dipped .	but
0	149813	I 've been punched in the stomach .	Then kicked a few times .	and
3	50417	And , pris and maury have the instructional tapes to create another .	Anything happens to me .	if
0	42219	He looked comfortable , one leg swung over the arm of the chair in his usual posture .	There was a full goblet on the table beside him .	and
1	45254	I am not angry but nevertheless i must point out that this is stealing .	I saw you most sensibly toss mister shank 's wretched cutlass over a wall and i understand your nervousness .	because
0	134372	She leaned in close and felt the pull in her chest .	Looked at the face of the baby .	and
0	7877	He 'd stand here and beg her to come to him .	Pour out all his troubles .	and
2	22218	Never killed anyone in my life-w-well , once . '' .	It was an accident .	but
2	41098	There 's tension between us .	I resist defusing it .	but
2	117867	She could run from him , she could hide all she wanted .	She would see the truth .	but
2	102536	Yes , he wanted to f**k her , which still made him feel vaguely guilty .	With this act , he 'd give hammer a vivid picture of the new reality-raine was off limits .	but
3	138779	We will reinforce our troops on the island and lay siege to the castle .	They fail to capture the castle .	if
1	56209	Did they start to pack up .	I looked at the clock , or because they knew the time .	because
0	106393	Just had a nervous breakdown but it never happened .	Would eventually pull out of it and share in the sorrow of losing their children .	and
2	121689	As we passed , i could have sworn i saw several faces peering from the windows .	I could take a second glance we were again enclosed by the forest .	but
4	124161	But her gratitude slowly turned an evil green color .	She noticed the other women ogling him and overheard their seductive comments about his beautiful body .	when
2	136066	It might not happen while i 'm alive .	I think it will .	but
3	18276	Getting another chance with her was going to be easier than i thought .	Those were her real feelings .	if
0	61053	Why he didnt talk about it very much joseph interrupted : they knew the obelisk was there , and the one on the moonill bet they assumed that we are the aliens who put them there .	That is why the submarines were waiting for us at the north pole .	and
0	78196	Craddoc began chuckling , the air of outrage at the tables subsided .	The people started smiling .	and
4	14898	She shoved thoughts of jeremy from her mind .	She pulled into the lot long before she was due at the lesson .	when
0	156852	But i ran away the morning after the ceremony .	Used the cash i 'd stashed away to have my slave bands removed .	and
2	146898	The sword glowered at her a little , although he mostly did it under his breath .	He kept right on grumbling about the protectorate .	but
3	71884	We now know that we would never know the result of that election .	An election were held where we chose the president by the popular vote and a candidate won by just one vote .	if
0	96037	His cheeks were bright red .	Icy snow clung to his hair .	and
4	82175	A moment later he knew she 'd returned ... and the control on his temper frayed a bit more .	Her psychic scent flooded the corridors .	when
1	46559	Leanne clasped her hands .	She desperately needed to hold on to something and that something had to be herself .	because
0	155368	To show up when i was summoned .	To put my telepathy to use for them .	and
2	148462	He asked me out . '' .	I turned him down .	but
2	86529	It 's almost finals week , and for the first time i have someone to tell me to calm the f**k down and that i 'll be fine .	I 'm stressing out about my classes .	but
0	70942	Kat triple-locked the door .	Pulled the gun from her purse .	and
2	153715	A lot of the families around here think the same thing .	What they 're wrong .	but
4	21895	A thousand albino goblins were swarming through the streets .	I looked back at the city .	when
2	155283	We both looked at him .	It seemed to be the end of his thought .	but
2	7591	Krynos had heard this before , in great detail , when draagh had set up this room and instructed him on the usage of the various computing devices .	He still enjoyed hearing things of worlds , especially ancient earth .	but
2	138755	Senior wizards did not often get out and about on what welkome to ankh-morporke probably called the thronged highways and intimate byways of the city .	It was instantly obvious that something was wrong .	but
3	23286	How much worse her situation would have been .	She had accepted passage with someone such as scates .	if
1	159008	Maybe angie became one .	She needed to know .	because
0	32064	They were still too far away for him to pick up their scent .	He had never possessed dante 's keen ability to determine different species just by their power .	and
3	44930	However , we did have to report quarterly .	We werent on an extended deployment .	if
3	67764	I 'll go see the doc . '' .	It 's not better in a few days .	if
3	871	Would stand little chance .	Someone wanted to hijack the heroin .	if
0	94707	Tane shoved aside his initial reaction .	Forced himself to consider the suggestion .	and
0	116229	He placed the knife on his forearm with the handle facing the captain is giving you his knife in exchange for your shiny fire maker .	Spoke a few words long rabbit explained two buffalo .	and
2	155786	He was old and he still had nightmares sometimes , of what had happened in corrica and when they had arrived .	Had forgotten much of what had happened in the past .	but
4	104240	He was so thrilled . '' .	Dev decided to go to law school .	when
2	141334	When my food arrived , i felt a little weird eating in front of him .	Phil reassured me several times that he was perfectly fine .	but
2	42561	The voice was deep not loud , but roger had no difficulty hearing him .	Barely lifted above the sound of the rustling leaves .	but
2	30251	I changed the subject before he could ask any more questions .	I also really needed to know .	but
0	121250	The septon took a gulp of wine , swallowed sighed with pleasure .	Sloshed it about his mouth .	and
0	50160	My sis got tired .	She left carnage in her wake .	and
2	145513	She didnt want to leave the puppy alone now that shed just gotten her back .	She also didnt want to miss the whole of the first day of school .	but
0	53803	Together they walked side by side toward the door , giving each other one last glance they reached out .	Pushed the door open .	and
2	156046	She did lean into his touch and .	Let out a shaky breath she had not even known she was holding .	but
0	31966	After a few more minutes of soothing , he checked his pocket watch , trotted over to the other side of the courtyard .	Then turned his horse .	and
0	159652	There was a rugged handsomeness to him .	Even in a still photograph , i could see a fierceness as he watched the crowd .	and
3	114178	And everything i had with kai-even .	I always wanted more-seemed to sustain me just enough until the next time i saw him .	if
2	54995	Ezio understood little of it .	Some of it was so familiar that his skin tingled , even his scalp , at the memory .	but
2	155003	I 'm not convinced anyone actually enjoyed our sances .	They were effective nevertheless and she was rightpeople expect certain theatrics from spirit mediums , so if we must put on a performance then so be it .	but
2	32012	We will attempt to keep the ship in hyperspace . '' .	In the meantime , please follow the illuminated strips in the corridors and make your way to your assigned emergency pods .	but
0	31408	The stream kicked up the brown dust .	Created little pools that shimmered in the bright sunlight .	and
4	19556	He would think such thoughts .	It was exactly the opposite that she was trying to accomplish .	when
0	8048	The circle was about ten feet in diameter .	It 'd been filled with a white powdery substance that i assumed .	and
2	154704	He might consider viper a conceited ass .	He did know that the vampire would fight to the death to keep shay safe .	but
2	14327	It 's all very well that cesare 's been brought down , and i see they 're thinking of bringing that young whippersnapper michelangelo here from florence .	I 've lost a valuable patron .	but
2	137264	His boot smashed the ixthian emberguard in the shoulder , not really hurting her .	Pushing her away from maeve .	but
0	37902	You 're worth living for .	You 're worth dying for .	and
0	106717	Do consent to play my part in these negotiations .	I swear that i will speak truthfully at all times , even to my own detriment .	and
0	40135	When she offered him her vein .	He fed from her .	and
3	152676	`` , how could you give her to that rogue bastard ? '' .	You were supposed to bring polli .	if
0	87098	The back door swung open .	He rolled , bringing up his gun .	and
2	76977	I thought he 'd jerk me to him .	Instead he lifted my hand .	but
0	7006	Finally , her appetite was sated .	She raised her head .	and
0	129174	`` but what these schmucks go out into the city ? '' .	Just bite anybody they see .	and
0	11407	His straw colored hair back from his eyes .	Focused on how many barrels of fish would go to market and how many would be placed on board to ship out .	and
2	109164	Ember and edeline were not out of shape , and the air was different too , thinner and more difficult to breathe for those not yet conditioned to it .	They were unused to the heat .	but
3	6278	I could regain entry to my flat .	I could just get to that window .	if
1	19550	Which was my own kind and which was the black cross hunter .	They were too tangled together-a blur of motion , sweat , and snarled curses .	because
0	120164	The following night was cloudy .	The air smelled strongly of incipient rain .	and
4	32349	That had assaulted mark and alec .	They 'd approached their own village after chasing down the berg and marching .	when
4	141772	* * * `` merrill is away , '' franklin advised me .	I made my way downstairs the following evening .	when
3	3087	He 'll kill you . '' .	Sawyer hears about this .	if
2	13817	He hated this idea .	Knew he didnt have a choice .	but
1	4908	Settle for something that made you run away , because it 's familiar , because you 're scared of takin ' a gamble on me .	You think it 's safe .	because
4	102967	A link was formed .	A vamp took from prey .	when
0	158529	That looked more like a door knocker than a knob , gasped at the blast of cold air that sliced across her skin .	Ari pulled the wooden door .	and
2	52658	Which did not properly catch in the greenery .	Would have stunned any enemy within .	but
4	156313	Everyone around wanted to be next to her .	She walked in a room .	when
4	38700	Another wave of guilt swamped him .	He saw the swath of blood marring the perfect whiteness of her thigh .	when
3	27741	I 'll just come .	I get a bad feeling .	if
3	157756	I wonder for a moment .	I can really say them out .	if
2	106452	Maybe i was reading into jude 's gestures .	I wondered if his concern for me was more than plain chivalry .	but
4	119146	Owed you a real apology for my behavior .	We broke up , and i 'm so glad to hear that i was mistaken about what had happened .	when
3	1770	`` it would not be fair , '' he said at last , `` .	I took anything that should be for me only , when i should be getting it not for my own work but for all of ours : we are all sharing .	if
0	46662	In fact , he never wanted to leave this bed .	If she had rolled over one more time and grabbed him , he might even have whimpered .	and
4	49575	Still , it worried me .	He confirmed what i suspected .	when
2	140322	She did not even walk into the room .	Spoke from the doorway .	but
0	59441	It almost certain the entire five church armies will be coming up to gunda 's wall all at the same time .	That 's all we 've ever wanted .	and
0	69468	If your uncle no longer causes you worry , you can choose to return to india instead , and .	The bhutanese would also help you with that .	and
0	63585	She walked away as will grabbed her by the arm .	Forced her to the ground next to me .	and
0	60582	He kissed her on the forehead .	Released his hold on her .	and
2	97752	Ivy opened her mouth once more .	Not to scream this time .	but
2	149301	I think there were a few people missing .	I dont know that meeting them would make a difference .	but
1	84072	Ricky probably took the class .	He knew there would be desperate , horny women .	because
4	153065	He had to keep his hands in check .	He wanted to step forward and hold her trembling body against the shelter of his .	when
0	87531	His body , warm and relaxed , brushed against hers , the rush of his breath tickling her skin .	He yawned right next to her ear .	and
0	141361	But if magickind knew what mathias had done , what he planned to do .	Got angry at the horrific violence mathias was inflicting , magickind might band .	and
4	86176	She saw that daniel was gone .	She glanced at the door .	when
4	17496	They fired a pair of high explosive shells .	Each team was ready .	when
3	83635	Seriously it was not obvious .	This guy had a flaw .	if
4	31645	You 're grilling me .	You obviously know more than i do .	when
2	151121	He came down beside her , close enough to feel imbued by the fragrant warmth of her body .	Leaving enough space for her attempt to observe a semblance of formality .	but
3	502	He felt sick remembering the terror in her eyesas .	She thought he would kill her .	if
0	112663	Dagger grinned , to let him know he was no longer afraid of him .	Looked him straight in the eye .	and
2	123555	My sweat-soaked jeans were like fishing sinkers around me .	I had full range of motion from the waist up .	but
3	134870	He 'd need her .	Two hundred men were marching on his fortress .	if
0	19696	But sato had learned some things on his own .	He stood in the darkness , enjoying the cool air , the quiet , the peace he always felt in a cemetery , he thought about one of them .	and
4	16894	You have to specifically prohibit certain measures .	You command the atans to do something .	when
0	149838	She turned her head .	Looked at his fingers .	and
4	137606	Then the music ended : dinner was about to be served .	The bandleader turned to the mic and made an announcement .	when
2	20508	True , she 'd started toward him after the fight as if to make certain he was .	He was sure that had been pure reflex on her part , the action of a naturally compassionate were .	but
2	89019	I searched it for tender warmth of any kind .	Remained chilled like ice .	but
2	86785	I had to wipe off sparkles like ice on a windshield .	I finally realized that i 'd found a djinn .	but
0	75652	Where a date with nick would lead .	Her nerve had failed her that night .	and
0	44617	I walked past him , staring out at the prison .	Stopped inside the doorway .	and
4	13125	I was nearly to the corner of the soaring wall .	I heard a faint sound behind me .	when
4	32125	`` maybe , but i 'll be glad .	This shindig is over to get back into my regular clothes .	when
2	47978	The small smile i allowed myself might have been barely visible .	I felt it all over my body .	but
0	153727	Even they sided with one .	Truly despised the other they thought it might be a net gain for the whole if the extremes were removed .	and
3	155442	Then you must face the consequences .	Youve done the deed .	if
2	94061	He tried to relax and focus .	Only three words would come to him .	but
2	101718	Jamie felt the pull of sleep .	Would not yield to it .	but
4	57900	You were just the consolation . '' .	He thought he could never have the real thing .	when
3	34921	I dont know , an idea luke planted in my head that i cant rid myself of , im going to college .	I belong with them , but for now , im going to do something very age appropriate .	if
0	105828	Where he usually slept , trying to sort through his most peculiar experience .	Walked on down to the noisy geyser .	and
0	90832	The other dragon wheeled flew .	Wyreth looked up for another threat , but .	and
0	116463	It made warm heat shoot through my head slide around my wounded shoulder like it were healing it .	Run over my body .	and
2	82416	Mother 's words are calculating and cold .	I cling to them .	but
0	153969	She shoved his head to the side .	He in turn shouted his pleasure as the woman bit into his vein and started to drink .	and
2	103782	She was beginning to understand what richard was getting at .	She decided to play it out .	but
2	107622	He came out of the crouch .	Sat on the side of the bed .	but
2	137842	It 's a bit of a drive .	You 'll love it .	but
3	75781	`` but ... what else have you noticed ? '' .	Her overall vision is significantly impaired .	if
2	139262	Who had pinned them down .	Recognised that there was little he could do about it .	but
3	96817	It cost us another boatload of taxpayers dollars .	That was what you were about to ask next .	if
0	36683	As if she quickly understood the demand would only make him prolong the featherlight kiss , she retracted her claws .	Released a sigh of frustration into his mouth .	and
3	83990	You wound up dead .	You got on the bad side of the wrong people .	if
2	145920	Mabel had never admitted it .	Elvi knew she had been somewhat frightened of her after her death .	but
2	27060	Roth 's hatred spanned many years was no shock to him .	He could hardly process any of that when the gravity of what claire had done -- what she 'd been willing to subject herself to , for him -- was still settling like hot oil in his heart .	but
2	33459	The loss of mad annie may have lessened monkeys assault on mortals .	She found herself still quite capable of handling her captives , despite the silliness of that ryan who had tried to distract her by standing with her children ( what was that all about .	but
1	98337	At 11:00 a.m. , kyle congratulated himself .	He could now bill the client $ 800 for driving in circles .	because
2	20272	Shouting at each other in front of the girls .	Compared to some of the families on jeremy kyle , we looked angelic .	but
0	89375	He closed his hand quickly , i.e .	Looked around to see if anyone had spotted this betrayal of all that was good and true .	and
3	27399	Maybe he lacked the natural meanness that i 'd experienced at school .	He 'd been in my shoes .	if
0	32226	It still spreads we can measure that effect pretty accurately with the 60 .	Now they seem to have a way to make a far more coherent beam than we can , but .	and
4	86317	Henry was sprawled on the sofa , watching a golf match .	I stepped into the foyer .	when
0	33789	To take command of the soldiers just as soon as they are released .	To assemble them in a place of your choosing .	and
2	76252	I started dribbling the ball .	Didnt get far when a girl with long brown pigtails from the other team flew from the side and snatched the ball out of my hand .	but
4	155014	Why stay away from your family ? '' .	You 're obviously homesick .	when
3	52850	`` go see '' .	It 's a friend , bert .	if
0	5742	When it was crackling .	Throwing sparks into the blue-black sky .	and
3	93175	He might get away with it .	He 'd worn black or some other dark color .	if
0	152038	Then she lifted her chin , aquitaine 's strong , appealing face appearing in her mind 's eye . '' .	Told veradis , `` should aquitaine become first lord , he would be well-advised to choose his battles - and his enemies - with great care .	and
3	76446	Maybe i could get close enough to stab him and then climb up the shaft to freedom .	I could distract jaggers .	if
0	46021	It was getting bitter cold , as the sun had set .	The passing rainstorm left patches of ice on the ground .	and
2	93220	Fila ducked her head .	He cupped her chin and lifted it until her gaze met his .	but
4	66253	Funny that he should take such joy in this , i thought .	It was a paltry thing compared to his magic .	when
2	126094	I had no idea what sort of house jenna had kept the only time i 'd seen it someone had gone through it like a storm front .	She kept a pristine car .	but
3	136465	Pete sat on that for a night , wonderin ' .	He should tell me .	if
2	127875	Being used to seclusion , felicity had wanted to find somewhere small , dark and secret to retreat .	The park , complete with its noisy fountain and the sound of laughing children seemed oddly safe .	but
0	63733	She gripped her cell phone harder .	Wondered what the pi would say if he knew she was staring into the all-knowing eyes of her deceased sibling .	and
2	76724	I tried to move , to shift my body in such a way as to relieve some of the agony .	When i did , excruciating waves radiated throughout my lower half .	but
0	128758	The air became icy-cold .	In spite of my exercise i began to suffer .	and
3	38646	It would be racing .	He 'd still had a heartbeat .	if
3	94308	Me feel to carry it-as .	I owned a part of you my brother never would .	if
4	28007	The tears were streaming down her cheeks .	She raised her face .	when
3	38087	No way would he take her up against the brick wall .	Even he wanted to .	if
3	94024	It would mean more functions and because that was what she was trying to avoid , she decided against it .	She became involved in a charity .	if
3	139065	I 'm not sure , but ... '' `` what ? '' .	I 'll apply next year .	if
4	144051	Jace had laughed and said , `` i thought you were ugly before . '' .	He presented himself to the others .	when
0	147116	When i realize so many eyes are on us .	Several cameras are snapping from all possible directions .	and
4	24822	She stopped being entertained .	She saw ashmore turn his glare to his brother .	when
0	8332	Where decisions meant life or death .	Any one of their party might know better than she what they ought to do .	and
4	11879	They were ready to promise anything .	Edmund gave a hint of his hope that the audience would be limited .	when
1	101179	`` yeah '' max says .	The erudite are the picture of humility .	because
3	11946	Things would have ended much sooner and shed still have enchantments magic in her heart-of-hearts .	Shed had a gun when harvey was beating her .	if
2	150721	Riders , blazing along the furycrafted stones of the causeway , were already upon them and all , huge , plunging shapes in the darkness , rearing and fighting to a halt .	Ran them down before bringing their horses .	but
4	96026	He flattened virtually an entire hillside in the process .	He had finally laid down to rest .	when
0	141441	The black brother made a disgusted noise .	Opened the door to admit him .	and
0	66584	That crossed a line in the course of civil behavior , unless they wanted her attraction .	Most women avoided iibala now , and most men were not quite as keen as they had been to be seen with her out in public .	and
0	132239	I took one step .	Thalassa took one step .	and
0	48877	Once the recreant returned to the states , he 'd made amends with ziggy .	They went about transforming necrospank 5000 into a new , more mage-centric incarnation .	and
0	158209	Peeked from the corner of my eye , but i caught him as he glanced at my hand holding his .	Saw a tired man from a long days work .	and
3	49867	Perhaps she 'd be .	He gave it a couple of hours .	if
2	127316	She came back and he would try to see josh in a few minutes .	Said he was in a meeting .	but
2	81647	I wanted to call up to warn him to be careful .	Was afraid to distract him .	but
4	96930	Peter elliot was a twenty-three-year-old graduate student in the department of anthropology at berkeley .	He first read about a year-old gorilla with amoebic dysentery who had been brought from the minneapolis zoo to the san francisco school of veterinary medicine for treatment .	when
2	140140	Each of them glanced helen 's way .	Swiftly returned their attention to simon .	but
3	3836	It would mean she was exceptionally interested and , therefore , exceptionally eager .	She emerged from her seemingly impenetrable shell far enough to take the initiative in a sexual liaison .	if
4	134948	My chest still swells .	I think about how much he must care for me .	when
0	69688	He concentrated on walking as silently as possible .	He nearly bumped into her when she suddenly froze and squeezed his hand .	and
0	142132	Still thinking of the defender .	Looking around at all of jiggers wonderful trinkets .	and
1	10686	Another he barely knew .	His own life was over , for the woman he loved was gone .	because
0	131376	You can stand there , but at the end of the day , i feel what you do .	Act all nonchalant as you want to .	and
4	39765	She eased her horse into a particularly shadowy corner and stopped .	Victoria and the undead moved far enough from the bridge .	when
0	94661	Her mom had hugged her for a full five minutes at bush airport before letting her pass through security .	Shed seen the tears in the corner of her dads eye when he said his goodbyes .	and
1	104596	In a way , it seemed like they had only just died .	She had only just found them .	because
3	78084	Anyone could become a wealthy , successful man .	He was careful about it .	if
3	22341	He would do better for us .	All he were not so difficult .	if
0	86583	Kloee frowned at bue .	Hovered next to jared looking at him .	and
4	32438	Every possessive instinct in his body stand at attention , almost unable to believe she was really his .	He saw the flash of his ring on her finger .	when
2	50332	I had some slim chance of jimmying the locks .	I screwed that up even once and got caught they could electrify the cell and remove any chance of escape .	but
2	51799	What i 'm wrong and .	She 's not what i think she is .	but
2	76301	You could really do this , emma .	You 've convinced me to move things faster .	but
2	149220	I searched for records to this place .	It was as if they 'd been expunged .	but
3	15023	I was afraid i 'd walk right into his arms .	He stood any closer .	if
0	133025	The waters waves were lapping against the bank .	The docks torches were beginning to be lit for the coming night .	and
2	45128	No one gets upset when you uproot a potato .	People do when cats get run over in the road .	but
0	144032	Rousing her fervor for the subject .	Perhaps making her snappier than she should have been when aden had so calmly stated his case .	and
2	365	He turned for the door .	Paused before he could make the full rotation .	but
0	58794	His entire cage shook .	His gaze snapped up .	and
0	33003	Not to mention that there were daimons on the street ready to kill .	He had innocent people to protect .	and
2	81926	He exhaled a puff of smoke .	Never turned my way .	but
3	65336	`` , i 'd do this ! '' .	You tossed my shoe in .	if
4	27906	Zero started staying at their house all the time to give them much needed support when he could .	His sporadic visits no longer helped .	when
3	21519	He 'd never gone with his cousin and his family .	He 'd never met alex at all .	if
0	48097	Garius gathered the knights around him .	Delivered a prayer of aid that would fill them with divine strength .	and
2	115880	He had noticed standing at the back of the room .	Who had not participated in the monitoring .	but
4	14043	I agreed to take all future programs at home , through whatever means .	The deal was done .	when
0	79464	He pulled back the man 's eye lids .	Shone the torch at his pupils .	and
4	155709	He was led out and then led into a security check point where he had to remove his jacket and belt and put them into the scanner .	He got to the probation office .	when
0	55127	She took my jacket , the kids now dispatched to a toy-covered quilt on the living room floor .	Tossed it into a closet .	and
0	8563	In short order the clan found the meadow .	Set about to make it as comfortable as possible for both groups .	and
4	152244	She knew the reminder had been intentional .	She looked up and saw her sister 's smile .	when
3	150715	She wasnt sleeping next to a fire pit but was already at aberffraw .	Gwen was still alive .	if
3	14499	I 'd also know .	I made danny happy .	if
3	62832	And , then what kind of marriage would they have .	That were the case .	if
3	77765	We will collide with the enemy mother .	We continue on this vector .	if
0	80666	She enjoyed trying to pick out words she recognized .	It helped pass the time .	and
2	134196	Hed wanted to ask her this question , it had been on the tip of his tongue for a while .	He couldnt quite bring himself to do it .	but
3	72251	`` um , ma is still on the phone . '' .	You two are finished .	if
0	144019	Berit was a young and idealistic knight .	He was having some difficulty with the behavior of their new allies .	and
2	12586	*** thirty-one claire tried to convince her niece that it was time to leave .	Skys protests threatened to reach tantrum proportions .	but
2	77907	I 'm reminded of henry 's toy airship .	When i look up , the sky holds only clouds .	but
3	72787	A car also didnt feel safe from a mad man .	He wanted in he could get in .	if
2	64295	They are quite dumb . '' .	I suppose that 's the point .	but
0	93033	Lord vetinari stood at the top of the stairs in the great hall of the palace .	Looked down on his clerks .	and
3	54695	He 'll only think he lost a friend .	I change tonight and the lambs exterminate me .	if
0	118678	The ghostly blue hue of the dimensional window fades away seconds .	Less is left with more questions than answers .	and
0	154126	She shot to her feet began scrubbing an empty , presumably dirty , pot .	Hurried to the sink .	and
0	118598	He tore with his teeth .	Put his hand over her mouth .	and
1	98538	I relate to franny glass .	I may be knocked up .	because
2	63197	I was too consumed to pay it much mind consciously , pushed me to intensify my grip , the force of my affection , the need to be sated .	My subconscious grabbed hold of my flickering hunger and nursed it .	but
4	153096	How much kendall had suffered .	She had found out about this baby .	when
0	124699	The haunce would sit .	Let an entire world be destroyed .	and
3	60512	But , she 'd take tanner king 's house in a heartbeat .	She were going to trade .	if
2	158471	He would use a dozen different fighting techniques in order to strategically offset ghost .	The man with the ebony eyes would counter angelos efforts with masterful efficiency .	but
0	8079	The impact knocked her back .	I threw the shark teeth at her , one after another .	and
4	40885	To get real jumpy .	Everybody nearby suddenly starts sprouting arrows out of their foreheads .	when
0	96383	Instead he simply refilled his own glass .	Selected a small piece of hard cheese .	and
3	154093	Then you need to view the principles firsthand and see if you 've learned enough to apply your book knowledge . '' .	You 're studying business management .	if
0	6485	On landing he thanked me .	Then returned to his hard bitten self .	and
2	83412	He clenched his hands into fists in his lap .	Fought to keep it from showing on his face .	but
2	106266	Then no call had come through , and .	I realized that she must have been a bit more upset than i thought .	but
4	23474	Switching gears from melting the ice between them .	She got here to how he wanted to handle her no-show .	when
3	50549	No one asked her .	That was good or bad and of course .	if
0	56131	Stabbing at my neck .	Pumping all kinds of disorder through me .	and
0	1699	She wants to dally with sorchak .	Try to raise demons in the middle of the night .	and
2	154560	Typically she would go back through the front door and slam it or she would talk to him .	Never did she treat him with kindness .	but
4	97380	The elders were not very happy with me .	Dont even worry about going into that .	when
2	88845	I expected him to return the smile .	His eyes were still fixed on the trees , which cast shifting shadows as their branches nodded in the breeze .	but
0	113225	He marched to the control panel .	Hit a reset button .	and
4	64336	Boy would dana be surprised .	She heard she made new friends and had a date .	when
0	59407	When the door was closed behind us .	We had privacy and quiet .	and
3	92545	Theyll end up killing each other .	This goes on much longer .	if
3	12697	Where the caterers normally work from .	We have a function in the boardroom .	if
0	147527	Misty scooped kyle and matt underneath her .	Stretched out on graham 's hard body .	and
3	24215	Somebody would be pissed off at him before he even got close to a piece of toast , let alone something more substantial .	He walked back in .	if
0	112050	It is a symbol , darcy , not words .	You do not have it because we had sex .	and
2	89289	It felt like cheating .	Her hidden resilience meant she 'd finally get to kill him .	but
0	116946	Please the sultan . '' .	Try not to be too cruel to me .	and
0	140743	That when all the races were first set upon this world , the gods spoke out .	Asked , who amongst you would like the power to tap the wonders of magic .	and
4	108964	How could he be a light in darkness .	Darkness so often confounded him .	when
4	17572	I got my first kiss from my babysitter 's son .	I was five and he was seven .	when
4	34952	Why there was even a point .	Yuri came to me for advice on how to kill her husband .	when
2	132302	I knew i had to show the inscription to areel , and .	Tomorrow was too late since the contents of the box were going to be moved to a safer place away from clumsy wannabe archeologists and indiscreet eyes .	but
0	36630	I 'm a vamp .	I can keep living as long as you do .	and
0	5753	( he usually worked late or read .	Came to bed after her .	and
4	150814	Windows cracked , the eardrums of small children ruptured , and dogs fell dead .	Dodie eberhart raised her voice to its maximum decibel level .	when
3	72324	She is very well and told the crew to meet her .	They couldnt find a way .	if
0	105020	Sam emerged to work behind the bar , india and i began moving at a faster pace .	Gradually everything settled back to normal .	and
0	55318	She swirled in the air .	Threw him toward the cliff wall using all her strength .	and
2	68768	He looked up for the tower of the giralda to get his bearings .	The surrounding walls were so high he could see nothing except a thin slit of breaking dawn above him .	but
3	118103	`` but , meghan , you would 've noticed i was mostly looking at you .	You opened your eyes .	if
3	122786	His lordship had kindly offered me a place , and i came here to ask if he still wanted me .	I ever left mr. horne .	if
0	89252	She placed the candle up to her face .	Placed her other hand over her eyes .	and
3	84037	Where they were headed .	She went with him .	if
0	68859	Finding each and every one of the men who had done .	Letting you cheer me on as i ripped them to shreds .	and
0	156718	The king sighed , sitting back in his throne .	Drank from his goblet .	and
2	73983	Uncle jack swears they left florida with the stuff .	They came back empty handed .	but
3	113785	It would mean my life . '' .	The prime commander ever knew i 'd sent it to you .	if
2	108708	His deliberate , congenial use of parker 's and meredith 's first names caused a momentary startled silence ? '' .	The anticipated pandemonium erupted almost instantly with questions being shouted from everywhere-the loudest from a cbs reporter in the front row : `` mr. farrell , why was your marriage to miss bancroft kept secret .	but
2	4077	She 'd get there after me .	Brent 's friend , dustin-my date-would be .	but
2	98633	God , what drake and i were doing was so wrong .	The thing was , we felt wronged by our situation .	but
0	50795	However a part of her was bitter .	Resented king dramon for deceiving her .	and

3	116799	They would hurt you .	I did not disappear .	if
3	147943	I will have no chance at a future family , or to meet one that i love .	The seer isnt stopped .	if
1	76081	Big-band music was playing in the air , and ten years of sobriety had been given to tom to help him carry on life .	A brand-new kind of cleaves was born , beautiful and precious .	because
3	17171	To correspond with her , they might 've had the same chance .	Perhaps he 'd had the opportunity to e-mail rosie .	if
2	128930	We still fight , and she 's never reverted back to that darkness .	We always make up .	but
2	118694	The demons scrambled to move away from him .	He turned and swung the sword , turned and swung , slicing one after the other in half .	but
2	158933	Had the courage to ask sara if her mother had found happiness with another man .	He couldnt bear to ask .	but
4	72587	Have time to ask for clearance .	Specially your radios already gone .	when
2	36071	There was nothing there in front of her .	Her sight was rooted to the empty space in the road , and her heart pounded with the anticipation that something was about to happen waiting with an overpowering sense of dread .	but
0	35505	He leaned across the bench .	Slowly , languorously , kissed me .	and
4	128059	Two of them approached jake .	Jake first met them .	when

0	101579	Kayleigh brushed a lock of her hair from her face .	Took a deep renewing breath .	and
2	142804	I left it sitting .	The number shed written was clear .	but
2	66669	Nena had secured the three horses .	Had gotten caught on the sandbar when the wave hit .	but
0	131046	Since we are not equal to god , the conditions for the covenant ( agreement ) are set by god .	We agree to do what he asks of us .	and

2	94220	I saw you and . '' .	I wanted you more than i wanted my freedom .	but
2	59409	He screamed once the first time zith bit him , and the scream ended with a horrid gurgle , and his hands convulsed helplessly in the air in front of him .	His hands came up to claw her away from his face .	but
4	67695	She threw back her head .	He stroked the swollen bud with his forefinger .	when
0	88134	That particular norm has been talking . '' .	Got me and the whole football team questioned last week .	and
2	96182	Me , jerk , grumpy said in character .	There were two things wrong .	but
4	76691	Ari was stil laughing .	She got to class .	when
0	122087	I leveled my gaze on him , blue eyes cold-dead behind their mask .	Waited until the uncertainty crept back into his eyes .	and
0	27156	I turned my head to watch him walk in .	Saw him stop and stare at me with unconcealed puzzlement .	and
3	66860	It will serve only our enemies , not our duchess .	We are constantly at each other 's throats .	if
3	26657	His end of the phone line was insecure .	Even what he thought to be the washington end wasnt .	if
0	101649	Memories of a wife flashed through him .	A sudden font of love sprang up and began to flow in his heart - yes , his wife marya .	and
3	63644	They will gas the building and any of us that survive will be forced out into the winter with nothing .	The humans learn our numbers .	if
1	144574	She had talked bill out of buying a sports utility vehicle just last year .	They were notorious gas-guzzlers .	because
2	101447	His breath was warm as it stirred a few tendrils of hair hannah had pulled free of her chignon and curled to delicately frame her face .	His words sent a chill spiraling through her .	but
2	80104	He looked tired and haunted .	Passion flashed in his gray eyes .	but
0	64428	The palace guards arrive .	We have a fight on our hands .	and
0	79870	The rushed inhalation and exhalation of his chest positioned the rolling muscles below his skin in intricate and appealing patterns , except the desire to reach out and touch it overcame me , so i took a step towards him .	I could have stayed there all night admiring the beauty unveiling before my eyes .	and
3	7035	They will love it , and they will do whatever it takes to make this mission work .	You open the door , if you let them see the world .	if
2	98206	She wasnt sure how soundly he slept .	One of the few things she could recall hearing about his kind was that they slept like corpses , or they were corpses , dead , until the sun dropped in the west and they were reanimated with life .	but
0	149020	I looked at him .	Saw that he was looking down at his boots .	and
2	130940	Have our first date in a more romantic location .	This is where it all started .	but
0	69569	Demetri clears his throat .	Bleeds a smile into my mother .	and
0	117331	Gage wraps an arm around my waist .	Leads us slowly down the shore .	and
0	114411	The merlin stared at me .	I could actually sense the pressure of his rage , like the end of a baseball bat poking steadily at my chest .	and
0	40968	`` i 'll put her in , '' he called .	The wolves began barking .	and
3	15388	The lord ruler would have fallen centuries ago . '' .	Perhaps the keepers had fought , rather than just memorized .	if
2	116809	4 a few more customers came into the restaurant .	It looked like it was going to be a slow night , so i decided to close .	but
0	48264	The only reason he didnt go .	Question him that instant , was his desire to get back to sapphire as quickly as possible .	and
0	117878	The man waved his staff around hurled it at the ground .	Tore a small pot off of it .	and
0	5343	He slid the glass into place .	Spun to face her .	and
3	133724	He was quite obviously constitutionally incapable of going around any obstacle.thus he immediately stopped being a fence builder and became an excavator .	A large rock happened to intrude itself in the path of one of his fences .	if
0	26322	It was a pleasant sound .	Henrik could see now in the candlelight that he was a young , handsome man with a great deal of natural charisma .	and
0	25173	Some were horrible i guess the letters just make sense to me .	Some things were wonderful , but .	and
3	149676	His destiny would be to stay here , swallowed by this village , and give his family the support they demanded .	His father and brothers had their way .	if
3	2125	You have to do it .	You dont want to .	if
1	5902	That day or how many lives you saved .	To your kids youre daddy and to your wife youre her husband .	because
0	150504	To stay on my feet .	Keep an iron grip on her waist .	and
3	48836	I would have someone wash my hair in a garden courtyard while i got a foot massage every day , but my parents had raised me to be too frugal for that .	I were naturally the self-indulgent type .	if
4	23312	He saw the faint indentation of his teeth in her shoulder .	She 'd been curled on her side .	when
3	146265	He would make up the hurt he 'd caused her .	It took the rest of his life .	if
3	115317	They were scrubbed before we were allowed to go in .	There were alien remains .	if
2	98709	We have every resource we need to survive for a long period of time .	The fuel we currently possess may be all we have .	but
2	21280	Anger lit his features .	His ire had found its way into my blood , causing my anger to answer his .	but
0	92038	Registers handed the piece of paper to dr. garb .	Wrote down the coordinates .	and
2	76564	The drive had been a nightmare .	Time had a way of erasing the sharp edges of that memory .	but
2	31179	Some of his father 's business dealings may be questionable .	Sebastian seems to have kept his nose clean .	but
3	113308	You 'll save a lot of money , not to mention mouse aggravation . '' .	He decides he wants to help .	if
2	142562	Himself falling for her .	When shed been sold as a slave it had been over before it began .	but
2	84652	Yes first i must tell you my dear ex was here and .	Said he thought you were a creat .	but
2	7209	Actually , he 's a very nice person .	He told me that he 's having second thoughts about doing it .	but
2	112975	It was a long stretch .	I was willing to give it a try .	but
2	72912	I love him so much , whitley , and when we 're .	That scares the shit out of me .	but
3	52011	We might have to test this some more , but i have a feeling that -- this is ridiculous .	We get other swords .	if
3	121591	Then it made sense to strike at him from afar .	One could be infected by cruach .	if
2	137601	He looks vaguely familiar .	Im not worried that he will recognize me .	but
0	16841	His cheeks were bulging .	So was the bag of the mousepipes .	and
0	141636	She grabbed the satchel from the floor .	Yanked out the two sealed documents .	and
3	39222	Hed be working for a timber mill .	He was into that .	if
2	134127	'' marion said apologetically , `` .	Exactly where will we find him .	but
3	129422	Discord will result among the house .	You can not show them you can be trusted to watch their flanks .	if
3	45936	I would be the one with you every waking second .	I had been the one to save you .	if
0	56079	All they were able to see was a green shade .	What appeared to be the head of a humanoid reptile .	and
3	158566	Nearby i could flag down or hotwire .	It came to that - as i burst out of the trees , i immediately had to put on the brakes .	if
0	24508	You 're only half my age in love and going to get married and and live happily ever after and blah blah blah ... . '' .	Have lots of little royal babies .	and
0	144489	There was an interruption .	We were able to escape in good time ahead of him .	and
4	60562	My nervousness was increased .	Almost at once , copies of the magazine began circulating in the chemistry department .	when
2	31778	I took this all in , in a single breath .	Understood with certainty that this fight could not last any longer .	but
0	42488	She asked chelsea , jumped over a couple being mauled by a phantom .	Then ran from the cart .	and
2	139841	Then sometimes her old self would come barreling through and .	She 'd blurt out things better left unsaid .	but
2	15008	My children ease my heart .	The days away seem to be slowly stealing my energy .	but
2	151824	I had a feeling you would have moved on .	His suggestions felt so right .	but
0	68480	I propped myself up on one elbow , so we were facing each other .	He lay on his side .	and
2	152474	I tried to reassure her . '' .	She kept telling me to get out .	but
0	124965	It was steamy in .	Trickles of sweat were now forming at her hairline .	and
2	62765	Nathan was attempting to sound lighthearted .	I could hear a trace of seriousness in his tone .	but
3	148654	So how about ? '' .	I try and take your mind off it .	if
0	98349	Rincewind peered at the pattern , tried to make out if the underside was any better .	Then lifted a corner of the carpet .	and
3	110460	She 'd come at the jerk like a crazy woman .	He was mean to chloe in front of becky .	if
2	138537	The enforcers were in charge of things like that .	She 'd probably be kept up for hours answering questions and explaining things .	but
0	106052	Angell turned away , holding a bucket .	Saw her mother which was running towards the fire .	and
2	21087	He 'd found himself in many tight corners in his life .	None had ever felt like this one .	but
3	102824	Id be the happiest guy in town , but you are doing what you always do .	I really thought that was possible .	if
1	34975	Maybe king bobby recognized a fellow cheater in marshall .	He was one himself .	because
2	47659	Luc had tried to fade into the background . '' .	Hunter had stared with those knowing eyes as he 'd shaken his head and muttered , `` stupid f**ker .	but
3	12329	We 'll see . '' .	We can get it stuck back on .	if
0	65590	`` just a moment , '' shallan said , `` you go on ahead . '' .	I 'll catch up at your carriage .	and
0	136506	He returned a few minutes later , wearing glasses .	Kenji and arthur sat down on the floor and continued to talk about their interests .	and
4	133682	Olivia , did you check the landline .	You went home to look for kieron .	when
0	9841	Sissy lifted her hands .	The soggy , soaked shower curtain came up with them .	and
0	143156	She respects me , and i her .	What i have to say .	and
3	74140	It would be a bit embarrassing .	Will tried to kiss him .	if
4	60877	He shook his head violently , scared that hed throw up if he spoke .	Sergeant brown demanded again what happened in the cell .	when
4	73543	He was still kneeling , with his hands up my thighs . '' .	He said , `` pick up your skirt .	when
2	6221	They were supposed to be talking about me .	It was like i was missing the conversation , or not truly understanding it all .	but
2	46526	`` we do all the measuring .	The toes are manufactured in singapore .	but
4	122170	To just come right and ask her .	We were taking a refreshment break .	when
2	127353	Epilogue opening weekend at the whittier inn could have turned into a disaster , even george .	Colin had agreed with luna that they should invite all the major players , including her grandparents and as many of the trevelyan pack as could make it .	but
2	33358	She was calling out .	No sound escaped her lips .	but
2	44700	It might not be much of one . '' .	It 's the best shot he has .	but
2	96917	There were so many things i needed to say .	I had no idea how to get them out .	but
0	79542	Trent , be a pal , huh ? '' .	Open it for me .	and
0	38579	Who put his neck out .	Expended considerable energy saving her sister .	and
0	103215	I cautiously opened the door .	Stepped onto the hallway .	and
0	102572	Elizabeth was safe , the boy was being a gentleman with her .	Lothaire could tell that hag had changed the boundary code since he 'd left .	and
2	126122	He snooped for a flinch in marks mannerisms .	He just peered back at him .	but
4	66332	How could he walk .	He wanted to run to safia .	when
2	124047	I gasped at his words and neither of us responded .	Saw hudson 's face go red .	but
0	56614	So hogan pulled off the main roads .	Struck out across the countryside .	and
0	63224	She stood , throwing her arms around me , hugging me from .	Came over to me .	and
2	23888	He did not have all the transcripts from the trials with him .	He did not remember them actually seeing her down .	but
2	71738	Where they could tackle the water in the middle of a course .	There were still problems .	but
4	106191	They were suddenly inside the dome .	The sphinx twisted the device .	when
0	63219	Their hands accidentally touched .	He helped stephanie into the boat before pulling her up .	and
2	133277	She felt ethan stiffen beside her .	Continued on , her voice dropping to a monotone .	but
0	36213	Then he noticed the epidermis .	Walked over to examine it .	and
2	133714	It was supposedly an accident .	My sources say it was n't . .	but
2	52958	He sighed at last and .	Returned the dagger to its scabbard .	but
2	127620	Thought i knew all over th ' station . '' .	I neffur knew there were this much of it .	but
3	147835	Then it 's me you like .	You keep saying no .	if
0	50641	Grabbing her right from your arms .	Vanishing back to the sanctuary .	and
2	100729	At first i thought it might be deveraux coming back after lunch .	It was n't . .	but
4	152232	He refused to tell me , saying it 's private .	I asked what it meant .	when
3	23282	The two of you work it out while you 're .	There was disagreement about anything .	if
2	153265	I waited to eat , watching the unattended steaming bowl of soup at the end of the table .	I didnt see drake coming to eat with us .	but
4	144879	He joined me and we kissed so passionately i forgot about my plan until the door opened and pa stood there with my sisters .	I lay on it .	when
0	145411	While nicholas was distracted , alex placed his hand on my arm .	Whispered , `` oh .	and
4	78705	You to recognize true and honest to god love .	It 's staring you in the face .	when
2	124318	I pulled out my own phone and , trying to see how far it went it was too dark to see anything .	Put it into the vent .	but
2	90077	I paused in place , anticipating some kind of response .	The only reply i received was silence .	but
2	128103	Any other had asked .	I am your emperor .	but
4	1879	My heart skips a beat .	I think for a second that maybe he did it for me .	when
0	60238	Just wait a few more days .	He still has not come , why not go to the lady .	and
2	153209	To my professors ' lectures .	I all i could hear .	but
3	31738	Mitch would have told him .	It was 100 % .	if
0	23329	James grabbed the lantern .	Slipped through to the room beyond .	and
2	73817	Which lloyd chalked up to a coincidence .	In truth linda and leonard hartigan played that tape every tuesday night and knew exactly what spot they had stopped it .	but
0	18315	He and the twins turned .	Started back down the mountain .	and
1	155973	My feelings must have been evident on my face .	I was the focus of over a dozen stares .	because
2	46321	My boss-former boss-makes an exasperated sound and marches toward the gate .	I stay where i am .	but
0	96139	The pages were blank .	Kosai thought about his mission .	and
2	24761	They exile the infected ones , you know-throw them out of the caves to fend for themselves .	I was waiting for the beast to take full hold of her-much better sport that way .	but
4	150497	I had just shut my eyes for just a minute .	I felt someone shaking my shoulders .	when
4	75889	He dropped down beside me and pulled me across his chest .	He was free of them .	when
0	116039	She reached for the door handle .	I took her arm , stopping her .	and
4	149810	I know that in a few minutes i 'll be thinking of nothing but damien .	I see what he has in mind .	when
2	160278	I didnt write this in .	Candace and i are .	but
2	85968	The writing looked vaguely familiar .	It took me a moment to recognise it as belonging to lucys sister sophie .	but
4	120984	Sensing the rush of a chill .	Passing into the wooded shadows beyond .	when
1	36968	I narrowed my eyes at her .	I knew she didnt mean for pizza .	because
2	62762	He still looks a little sad .	At least that 's better than desperately depressed , the way i found him earlier today .	but
4	139110	To save a young girl .	She gave her life .	when
0	66455	In any case , the ink looked about as fresh as the blood on the bunk in the cell .	The gunslinger had a good idea that chas .	and
4	112877	She snapped her head .	Zane smiled at her .	when
2	32878	I feel like kicking him .	I 'm not the violent type .	but
1	27335	He must have noticed it .	He immediately loosened his hold .	because
3	134209	Sounds good , but i dont know .	I have the courage to act how i want to act all the time .	if
0	17489	Dragging somewhere in the back of her mind .	Like lead , heavy and .	and
4	39386	Whose indignation the line of hammond 's inquiry required no translation .	He had made out .	when
4	158549	He was still reining in his shot control .	The girl and a woman came out of the house .	when
2	75784	When i was convinced i was a book and , that i was music he was the only one that could hear me .	He was the only one who knew how to read me .	but
2	130563	None of them depicted him .	Rather they were the generic types most often found in the houses of wealthier merchants .	but
0	99088	You made a copy of the box .	Were trying to trick me .	and
2	5415	He was hands down the most charismatic , fabulous man she 'd ever met , the stuff of every woman 's daydreams .	Life with him in it felt rather like having her foot jammed on the accelerator .	but
2	120055	Listen , we are all curious about you , i 'm sure you understand .	Kiran is taking this .	but
3	4340	But , that is how id go about it .	I wanted to learn .	if
4	34058	No , i managed to neutralise the source .	I found an by the lake .	when
0	61134	Kai walked out from behind the house .	Stalked rory with the shotgun .	and
3	138002	And he hasnt signed .	Even she were a boy .	if
2	95128	His words are all wrong , i should be the one thanking him .	I understand just what he means .	but
3	126912	He 'd have to give himself over to it .	He wanted to learn more about the phantom .	if
2	1943	Added most of that eco stuff is really just crying wolf these days so never mind .	She then thought further and .	but
4	103131	They were both delighted and started teaching me everything they could about guns .	I began showing an interest last year .	when
1	126934	We dont take action .	It can only get worse .	because
0	17375	In the cab back to his flat , her hands held his .	She leaned against him and stared at him as the light from passing cars and streetlamps illuminated his face .	and
0	42808	No one could expend that amount of energy .	Not have tremendous physical repercussions .	and
2	143624	I thought he 'd find me , calling out my name .	He walked right past the brush .	but
1	84777	When vanessa told colton she was coming to the dance with me and rory , he insisted on coming .	His father the franklin mayor is having a reelection event at their house and colton hates glad-handing .	because
2	12093	Gideon ... she needed him and , no matter the cost .	She intended to get him .	but
2	116884	With nothing else in mind that could help them out in that match , alonso could only hope that some miracle happened lea moved forward and attempted to attack with a left hook to karen 's head .	Karen slid forward and blocked it with the right arm .	but
1	15092	Sorry , cant , i answered .	I plan on forgetting all of this the moment it is .	because
4	154099	He brought the box cutter up and turned it slowly so tommy could see it .	He reached the nape of tattoos neck .	when
2	42827	Sure , he 's .	He 's not long for this world .	but
3	124688	It would be very difficult for him to devote himself to his studies .	He had to work even a few hours a week .	if
0	66569	That had been raised in anger .	Bade him not to seek his father .	and
0	30663	Maybe he could even talk them into letting them go or perhaps claim hes been sent to search the house .	Then say they were suffering with something .	and
3	115044	She 'd never particularly cared for him .	Even he was good at his job .	if
0	151893	You 're badly wounded . ' .	I 've already lost enough friends today .	and
4	57970	Putting an end to the nail biting .	I slam to a halt , he places his hand over mine and guides my thumb away from my mouth .	when
2	142634	People expected him to be weak and unable to cope .	His body was a shell for a mind sharper than most around him .	but
0	107815	I grabbed him again threw him to the ground .	Tristan gained his feet , pushing me away , but .	and
2	143135	He pauses and my panic and fear seal my throat .	I try to respond .	but
0	82490	Then beren gazed in wonder on the selfsame jewel of feanor that he had cut from morgoth 's iron crown , now shining set amid gold and gems by the cunning of the dwarves .	He washed it clean of blood in the waters of the river .	and
0	129980	Jim turned his coffin nail around .	Looked at the bright , glowing tip .	and
0	45451	Lucy put up her hands to push back her hair .	Found she was pushing back vine branches .	and
0	82034	Hes decided to spend his last precious hours , minutes seconds before he has to leave with erin .	Its the night before jon ships out , and .	and
2	117898	The conspirators had no lack of motivation or clarity in vision .	They all knew the possible consequences of acting against the group of eleven .	but
2	70628	Heat flooded into her cheeks as she reared back a step , wishing she could evade the riveting intensity of his eyes .	Determined not to appear even more disturbed by him than she had already revealed .	but
0	123217	I sliced his air valve , ernie called out .	Was proud he was able to pull this off without getting a beating from jesse .	and
0	9462	I walked closer to the car , and remembered that magical clamor doesnt work in close proximity to wizards .	Got a whiff of wolf .	and
2	102561	Now im living with her because i choose to .	When i first came home it was definitely out of necessity .	but
2	150544	I thought he had a gun .	Thats not something you can really explain or apologize for , especially to ballardoops , sorry about your eye popping out ; didnt mean it , so no biggie , right .	but
0	8822	All the dishes had been whisked away by peter .	Everyone was drinking the last drops of their full-bodied , dry red wine .	and
3	73434	I know you must 've met gideon .	You met my sister .	if
2	71567	Ben was convinced she saw him as the fiat rushed past .	She showed no sign of having recognised him .	but
2	105098	She wanted him to take her in his arms .	He just stood there , distant and .	but
0	15392	I was holding out my hands all the time , i was so thirsty .	Licking the rain off them .	and
2	96168	No , i am not considering chasing you or eating you for that matter .	Perhaps the dragon is .	but
0	22141	We quickly entered found hades waiting .	Stepping into the entryway .	and
3	144398	Tristan probably would have slept with her .	It hadnt been for his sister mina .	if
4	29957	How can i jump to any conclusions - '' `` edward , i said let me explain ! '' .	My own father thinks that i 'm some sick .	when
0	130455	But tess and vlad had seen the young woman when officer debany brought her from the emergency room .	They agreed that until the unrest was dealt with one way or another , merri lee was too vulnerable staying in her apartment near the university .	and
2	130807	This was not my plan .	I felt as he looked at the ragged , desperate stranger , these were the thoughts going through his mind .	but
2	150930	He wielded a sword rather than a mace .	Tall or short , mace or sword , being pursued by an ozac was not a matter to be taken .	but
0	1017	The long curving stretch of sand , circled by tidy , square buildings in the portuguese style and a neatly planted row of saplings , had all the comfort of familiarity .	Most of the junks having their sails still furled might almost have been small dinghies at anchor in funchal or portsmouth roads .	and
4	97863	Papa had introduced her to this dish .	She was barely capable of conveying spoon to mouth .	when
0	7175	Rounding the sixth ramp , she vaulted over the cement wall .	Landed in a crouch .	and
0	113720	That kims plan had been laid at julies feet .	Now there was no one but julie to dispute her version of events .	and
3	53084	Their country would be in ruins .	They could not collectively settle on a single bride .	if
0	42908	He reached back , and stuck the band in his pants pocket .	Took the band off his hair and let it fall gently to his shoulders .	and
2	67229	I was hasty and unwise in my dealings with my father .	I honestly do believe that he left me little choice .	but
2	66280	It appeared to be driven by a man .	It maintained a following distance of four or five car lengths , preventing her from getting an adequate view of the driver .	but
0	146347	But we thank you for your concern , mademoiselle delerue .	Would you be willing to indulge us and play the pianoforte .	and
4	24618	Well , i think its pretty powerful .	You talk about your own recovery .	when
2	7992	Your body was able to overcome most of what occurred .	Im afraid it cant overcome what happened to your legs and .	but
2	52347	I should have said something . '' .	It 's never been a big issue .	but
0	155296	Opening the back door of the car .	Reaching for gails suitcase .	and
0	73281	He grabbed her hands .	Pinned them above her head .	and
0	139508	Colby leaned back against the sagging step .	Followed eddy 's gaze .	and
0	120632	A servant stepped between us with an offering of venison stew .	Winchester ladled a bowl for me and then himself .	and
0	97463	It was eleven thirty before felix rose to his feet .	This time the gathering was subdued and perhaps ready for his more sober reflections .	and
0	112239	Taking a deep breath .	Trying to let my eyes convey what i was having a hard time articulating .	and
0	130749	After the cans of fuel were emptied , inside and out , fired a flare into the cabin .	Charlie jumped aboard the rib .	and
0	72310	She turned on her heel .	Strutted off down the road .	and
2	76052	The eyes in front were gone .	Peaches could still see them on either side .	but
4	10187	Conquer by his own force .	Their attempt was brought to a bloody end .	when
0	44401	The bear cub closed its eyes , rumbling in its belly .	Leaned on carly 's legs .	and
0	109128	Pierce curled his fingers to take a stronger grip on me .	My shoulders eased when i felt the warmth of a masculine-tasting energy fill me .	and
2	98228	A shark might conceivably come in after him .	In the confined space it would be almost impossible for it to bring its underslung mouth to bear on him .	but
4	81497	How he had woken up in the middle of the night .	They all slept outdoors , and when he couldnt go back to sleep he had snuck off to play with an electronic game he wasnt supposed to have .	when
4	27338	He gave her a look of complete satisfaction , then leaned forward and kissed her lips .	The last of their orgasms eased .	when
4	51102	My stomach rips open .	I hear her voice .	when
2	101632	Will 's good opinion of him was helpful .	Will was one of his best friends and might be giving adam more credit than he deserved .	but
3	120016	I will take you into town with me tomorrow so you may see for yourself .	That will make your decision easier .	if
0	5446	It feels so good to be in our soft bed again , she said .	Snuggled close to tony .	and
1	69911	I disregard his question .	I have no idea if i 'm a keeper or if he 's supposed to think i am one .	because
0	123267	It flicked past one of the knights terra .	Drew a streak of crimson across his cheekbone .	and
4	16533	Gabe stopped and looked around .	He was thrown to the floor and dagger plucked from his hand by the materializing pirate .	when
2	50239	Might not the victim reported it .	They might be valuable , and requested anonymity and no details about the paintings , so ... '' `` have fun , '' john said and returned to his screen .	but
1	4268	I was just going to ask her if she went to boy scouts ... . '' .	She has my heart all tied in knots .	because
0	20335	They 're not generous with magic .	We 'll soon find out if he uses any .	and
4	66815	I tried being encouraging and supportive , but it was forced from both of us .	He did talk about it .	when
0	74424	What she was looking at , until her sharp nails bit my skin .	The chain on my necklace snapped .	and
2	141260	The perfection of his presence had disappeared .	This was better than fighting .	but
0	7102	I drew my sword .	It shown so bright that my instincts too over and i moved to try to block the blinding white light with my hand .	and
4	66612	Ah , greed always talks .	It comes to con wilder .	when
1	40438	The morning shoot got pushed .	Lauren was feeling sick but later she felt better so they were behind schedule when they filmed the restaurant scene .	because
0	1399	The heart to save them .	The heart would come without question .	and
4	141834	That happens often with infants .	Even the baby 's eyes changed from blue to gray-well .	when
3	71562	I would tell you . '' .	We had been able to obtain a single sample or reading , apart from my weight .	if

2	82152	You find me irresistible and usually manage to do it multiple times employing all sorts of creative positions .	We make love at least once a day .	but
1	42803	More like i 'm her only shot and the sister seems to get it .	It really does have to be .	because
2	119475	We 'll handle it ? '' .	Not like this , okay .	but
3	127087	He will let you .	It is his pleasure .	if
0	105993	When she returned he had everything packed .	Asked did you check your injuries .	and
3	108956	How did you survive , ? '' .	It was not the summer court behind it all .	if
4	19256	Besides , he sucked ass .	It came to talking to women .	when
0	115140	I left ethan 's apartments .	Closed the door behind me .	and
4	58890	The same need hit me .	I saw you in my office .	when
4	92692	It shatter into pieces .	It hit the floor .	when
0	108953	Take some kindling and a big stack of wood .	Set it up in the fireplace like i .	and
3	85412	Then i cant fly as high .	I lose pieces of them .	if
2	73090	It took everything in him not to kiss her .	He managed to get out the door without giving in .	but
2	100966	A trickle of sweat slid down my spine .	Even so i was chilled .	but
0	119193	She shook her head , the light glinted off her glasses .	He watched her pull into herself , watched her pull away from him .	and
3	62569	If you write to them and it stays in their computer , what you say can be subpoenaed , so i dont want you talking about what happened or justifying yourself to anyone .	You talk to them and its recorded .	if
0	7767	They grabbed on to dawn with each hand .	Said something to her .	and
2	146295	She replayed the last few days over in her head .	Was too stunned to make sense of it .	but
2	52911	It was a small sharp pain .	It was just this side of being too tight .	but
1	32916	To do those things .	Just you are my servants .	because
0	38996	Several times he came to himself .	Realized that hed been standing looking at the cataract for minutes without being aware of anything .	and
2	25825	They had no recollection of the lady who visited them that night .	They felt a strange fullness in their hearts that they hadnt felt since the disappearance of kurt .	but
2	76900	Look i am not sure how important this is .	I think you should know that i saw a number of monsters in the mountains .	but
2	87297	The air was thick with steam and cigarette smoke .	Jude tried his best to ignore it all .	but
0	135260	He called the dogs in went into the study .	Got out of his boots .	and
0	94129	She ran to the boy .	Threw her body against his for a hug .	and
4	17408	Her father was a northern outcast .	They were on land .	when
0	81150	They were propelled into the cabin by another man-at-arms behind them .	Threw their arms around one another , not game to look at anyone .	and
0	5066	Art grabbed his skull with both hands .	Screwed up his face against the invisible force that seemed to fill the space around him .	and
3	91981	She could get one .	She ever changed her mind .	if
3	43580	He was going to stay alive to make sure he found it .	There was a way to get .	if
2	31705	She tried to thank him .	No words would come .	but
2	72299	Master , be not ired with me .	I come to be scowler own-self .	but
2	134876	He was a natural blonde .	His dye job was so bad it looked like a weave from mattel-like barbie .	but
1	77267	Politics moves slow and no one wants to be the person that screwed it up . '' .	The stakes are very high .	because
2	103936	Angelo thought to sit closer to him , to offer him a shoulder in comfort .	Such an affection was not the marchetti way .	but
2	126229	He wanted to ask so many questions .	He was afraid to interrupt her .	but
0	150098	I moved into the living room .	Looked at him more .	and
0	138745	Pap and i now share the same knowing smile .	I turn to hunter .	and
1	38874	Not only do i talk dirty .	I can act out all the dirty suggestions .	because
0	1203	Quitting the safari thing .	Open up a caf of his own .	and
4	18080	She suddenly didnt think they were flying too high .	One struck hentys foot .	when
4	148395	And , they must have used the opportunity to do this . '' .	We bound your powers to prevent that .	when
0	5712	He gave me an odd look sent her off to follow the wall to the door out .	Grabbed an older woman who was passing .	and
4	26225	Carlos knew that he would stop at nothing to take it from juanita .	He didnt inherit it .	when
4	87349	Town-like he always seemed to do .	We needed him-these documents were all we had to focus on .	when
3	143548	There was absolutely nothing after that .	There was little enough to do at night in wemsley before ten .	if
2	122894	There was some horn blowing , so he retaliated .	That was what driving was about in this city .	but
3	25893	Not to draw the chain from the door in the future .	Christine should , perhaps , come .	if
4	88639	His soft lips felt amazing .	They were wet and sliding over mine .	when
0	124118	Simard hit the light , and gestured stein to sit .	Sat on the couch .	and
2	83669	He knew that fame was key .	It was clear that while being the right hand of calico might earn him some small status .	but
4	45142	As i predicted i had tears streaking down my face .	I wrote and reread the last two chapters .	when
3	62289	But , then it is special , whether or not it is good .	It is important enough to you .	if
3	116466	You would think we were in the throes of passion , that this was the honeymoon of our desire .	You were walking down the beach and stumbled upon us .	if
4	93135	I hate it . '' .	Hot girls demean themselves .	when
4	145565	They were so freaked .	Lief came charging out at them .	when
2	84558	I was excited for the three-course meal .	Frowned at the small pile of minuscule black balls with the tiniest spoon i ever saw .	but
4	111783	Sweat is beading my brow , impaling herself back , begging for it harder ... faster .	She finally starts moving her hips .	when
0	31194	Up here scouting this terrain .	Had left his mark for me his alter ego and mistaken identity fall guy to discover .	and
2	132672	My dad always told me i was a good tracker with an excellent sense of direction .	I do not want to risk breaking the promise i made to june .	but
3	108092	You have to trust me .	I 'm going to be a part of your life .	if
0	54990	`` my lord of lannister , '' said lady blackmont , `` we have come a long dusty way .	Rest and refreshment would be most welcome .	and
2	143128	It blew me off my horse .	Cletus nocked an arrow to his string and brought one .	but
4	97056	Alison was feeling faint .	I got up so i couldnt very well leave her .	when
2	71254	Training horses for a person with a specific handicap is challenging and often a long process ; we both knew this was our calling .	When we saw the tears of the first young lady we trained a horse for her that had lost a leg in an auto accident .	but
3	67514	Maybe in the spring .	You still want to we could move .	if
1	109365	And part of him was glad for her refusal to love again -- the right of every breedmate who lost her beloved .	While it meant he would live in the misery of wanting her , he would not have to accept the even more crushing blow of seeing her bonded to another male .	because
1	88484	My father slit my throat and murdered my wife .	He thought i 'd betrayed him by getting married .	because
0	119634	Here i 've been offered this great mission .	I 'm so unworthy .	and
2	3988	It was going to take a very long time to heal from it .	Daniel and i would do it .	but
4	42626	He 'd looked at her .	She 'd taken his hand-that look of raw hunger-was enough to make her keep her distance despite the chill in her bones .	when
4	98021	His mouth dried out .	She reached up to tuck her bangs behind her ear .	when
2	115017	I wanted to keep it as quiet as possible .	I had to exchange some publicity in regards to the abandoned child story in order to make your story believable , including to tom .	but
3	84419	They 'll have a terminal there .	I go to the lobby .	if
3	93889	I asked the band .	I could tag along just so i could see him .	if
0	11006	She snatched something out of a suitcase .	Whirled , brandishing sonia 's stretchy , black , cotton nightie with the deep hem of black lace and matching lace covering the cotton at the bosoms .	and
0	6934	At the moment when the sun crosses the meridian , we turn the sandglass .	Keep doing so until the conjunction tonight , when the moon and jupiter come .	and
1	5956	Which made it all the more embarrassing .	When i came strolling up with my towel , all the girls came to the edge of the pool to say hello .	because
0	130289	Nearly collided with a stray dog .	Marched back into the principal 's house .	and
2	82161	The smoky taste of the whiskey lay smooth and rich on her tongue .	When she swallowed , it was swallowing fire .	but
1	108801	I can not love vartan .	I am hopelessly in love with corvus .	because
1	75029	People , baer included , were overly affected .	Tanya was normally so considerate and gracious that they were unable to tolerate an unkind word from her .	because
3	111238	They 're still cold .	You get 'em from the .	if
2	92631	Great was the company that night and the light of many torches fell upon them .	The lady airin was not there , for men drank overmuch at brodda 's feasts and their songs were fierce and quarrels blazed about the hall , and those things she loved .	but
0	105614	He reaches into the ground .	Opens a small door .	and
3	57378	Thenbelieve mei will find out and haunt you to your grave .	You do not obey me .	if
2	36790	Emily went to speak .	Was silenced by olivia smashing her finger against her lips .	but
0	35455	To touch each other .	Give each other pleasure .	and
0	26703	There was so much to do , so much to feel .	The currents of the world kept pulling at me like they were playful children .	and
4	8321	I watched as they vanished at the landing , mom 's voice fading .	They entered my parents ' bedroom .	when
2	26796	The forcefield that kept them apart prevented the passage of sound .	Scytale saw idaho 's lips move and read the curse .	but
4	66450	It didnt really bother us .	She was just making stuff up about other people .	when
2	11530	The moon is pretty bright out .	Each group is still allowed a flashlight .	but
4	35102	She had made for him .	She started her lessons .	when
2	46977	They may try to extract every last shred of moral dignity we have .	We control our souls .	but
3	101247	Youd do the same .	It was your sister .	if
4	2558	She was just shifting to take him deeper .	He used his hands in her hair to lift her gaze away from his groin .	when
4	98039	`` did you really mean it ? '' .	You said you were done carrying a gun .	when
3	100075	The first of many .	She had her way .	if
4	133533	Imogen felt an eager tug between her thighs , and she rocked forward in her flats , losing her balance .	His tongue invaded her mouth .	when

2	65266	Instead of hiding in the dressing room as they normally did , leaving dane to man their t-shirt stand , they dressed in stage outfits and .	Joined him in the foyer .	but
2	91241	She rounded on paul .	Evan caught her arm .	but
0	64784	He hated war more .	He would be in the thick of it .	and
0	145893	Finally the ever-expanding model had fallen out of favor .	Was in the process of being scrapped .	and
3	44396	But , you 're as insane as my mother .	You think you 'll chain me here and turn me into some broken dragon available at your beck and call .	if
2	23936	They are very powerful beings .	They have some major drawbacks .	but
2	5230	I tried to take his keys .	He got away from me before i could .	but
3	58415	We could 've taken precautions .	You 'd been honest from the beginning .	if
0	12014	I ripped my left arm out of his hand .	Slammed my elbow into his solar plexus .	and
4	2203	Sarah saw that the knees of his pants were circled with brown .	Jonah stood up from the dirt .	when
4	146498	I found a secret door opened .	I was cleaning his room .	when
2	140231	She looked at the pond , desperate to check on her son .	Knew better than to try .	but
2	72479	Rhage loved to play with the damn thing .	Every time he did , fritz got nervous and wanted in on the action .	but

2	44435	Deer are the pumas primary food .	They will supplement their diet with smaller mammals , such as raccoon , porcupine or marten .	but
2	16939	Moving would be an adjustment .	We could endure it .	but
0	96003	Moog held his hands cupped .	Walked to one judge at a time .	and
1	6545	He had a terrible feeling he should have been paying better attention to what his mother had been saying about him to delphie .	He was pretty damned certain she 'd been listening when the master manipulator-better known as helen davenport-had been talking about him .	because
4	110013	Jin was once again sleeping .	He was kicked from his bed onto the floor .	when
2	38449	Chapter 6 saturday morning was dull and gray .	Nothing could dampen helen 's spirits .	but

0	9374	Smoke rose from the entrance creating an eerie atmosphere .	Making the cavern appear menacing .	and
0	23267	Her color was back on her human form .	She was getting stronger .	and
2	153276	No physical harm done .	Rape is rape , and eventually you have to look at your face in the mirror again and decide what to make of yourself .	but

2	158306	He needed as much information as possible .	He would have to handle this .	but
3	111439	I wish i could change , that would be it .	There was one thing .	if
2	8070	In kissing , caressing and giving to this woman , doug had learned-not only that it was possible to put her first physically , but .	He wanted to put her first .	but
2	133565	Granted my fathers wealth would still be a bright asset .	I could never hope for a suitable match .	but

0	70834	To take her in his arms .	Bend her will to his , to bury himself in her sweetness before he surrendered to the dark sleep .	and
3	120858	Youre going to give yourself a heart attack before youre thirty .	You keep assuming the worst .	if
0	9377	I had a pretty face .	Knew how to do my hair better than most guys .	and
2	157118	As yet we have passed only a few open boats .	None of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek .	but
2	28053	It was a ridiculous thing to use as the seat of the firstborn .	Like everything about this little village , it would just have to do .	but
3	26938	I will set your knight free .	You can help me find it .	if
0	74775	Then she scooped up her hair .	Twisted it in a messy knot at the top , back of her head .	and
3	7347	I spent three days wondering .	She had just stopped by ... or maybe she was leaving after they had just had sex .	if
0	93466	I 've been alive for seventy thousand years i know when i 'm right .	Give or take a millennia .	and
2	29913	Anyway , far be it from me to tell you how to live young man .	I just dont think you know much about their kind to get involved .	but

2	17816	She felt a bit like scrooge waving goodbye knowing that they were all off to the pub for celebratory drinks .	She had already had a few glasses of champagne too many in the staff room at lunch time and her head was still swimming .	but
3	155669	He certainly did n't . .	He 's the one who stirred the pack in this direction .	if
4	158955	I be with brian .	All he 'd been possessive about the idea of my male roommate .	when

4	153643	I 'll call you . '' .	I know where we 're going .	when
0	83104	As part of his cover , his marriage to madeline had been arranged .	He had begun the slow process of earning entre into the underground movements scene .	and
4	112295	Patsy didnt even go to the court .	Her mother was sentenced to three years in prison for running a brothel and living off immoral earnings .	when
0	131586	Clearing his addled mind .	Allowing him to think .	and
4	149626	He did so with a nudge to the side of the ribs .	Seward awakened jaikus to join him at watch .	when
3	19799	Id tear this whole building .	I had my way .	if
4	76946	The main road and my jaw drops .	I see what is .	when
0	22162	Hed blamed the gypsies for all manner of crimes .	Found the farmers and work-hands of erenburn an eager , and gullible , audience .	and
0	35090	Todd put his fingers in the air .	Counted down from three .	and
3	120441	He presented a frightening sight .	He looked only one-tenth as bad as he felt .	if
0	57584	If ivy had gone to check on tunstell , the two would be isolated .	That was not a good idea .	and
2	120241	She wanted to just tell sevita .	Frank would be upset .	but
2	96136	It 's chilly outside , only a snug black t-shirt and a pair of perfectly fitting jeans .	He 's not wearing a jacket .	but
2	43831	He had the office number .	He never called her there .	but
0	66710	The beach was rockier the air was colder .	The ocean was there , but .	and

0	75999	She had a broken chair leg in her hand .	She was shoving it against the gray wolf .	and

0	70228	Who he would bet his life on .	May have to make that bet .	and
4	117371	Stopped in his tracks .	He saw bruno and ronnie standing there looking just like that they had .	when

0	104451	A pole next to him in line stood .	Started to run-and the will seeped back into young setrakian 's body .	and
1	95968	It was pretty funny .	Julie 's money was on sam in a throwdown .	because
2	84324	She started towards him , jaws snapping open and closed .	Ryan slammed the door and fastened the deadbolt .	but

3	69799	Thus she would find herself good and ruined .	She continued to speak .	if
0	67758	He pulled up his tee .	Caught the blood flowing over his mouth .	and
2	44078	What i said to oswald not only because he had the power to step in .	He was objective and not intimately involved .	but
3	23440	I picked tim in his box up from the side of my seat and put him on the table .	So he was conscious at all .	if
2	19187	Not only was emma a payal .	She wanted children-something he felt should not be allowed .	but

2	15956	She had to because he was dillon 's friend , and - this ... this was different .	There was no doubt they would run into each other from time to time .	but
3	30728	It was not in tess 's lifetime .	The shack had ever been painted .	if
2	129837	`` that 's my business , '' she said .	There was no sting in her voice , only a quiet sadness .	but

0	86822	Perhaps you should leave him .	Go after the flute yourself .	and
2	1853	I shook , unsteady .	He kept a hand on my waist to help me .	but
0	121276	He slowly went to her .	Tucked a curl behind her ear .	and

2	86870	Whatever , i wanted to say .	Just yawned at him .	but
